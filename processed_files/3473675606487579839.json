        "5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Introduction Cyprus was granted independence in 1960 with a Constitution that set out a power-sharing system, strictly communally divided between the \u2018Greeks\u2019 and the \u2018Turks\u2019. The Constitution recognises two \u2018communities\u2019, the Greeks and the Turks and three \u2018religious groups\u2019, the Maronites, the Armenians and the Latins. The \u2018religious groups\u2019 were obliged to opt to belong to one of the \u2018communities\u2019 and opted to belong to the Greek community. The Roma community of Cyprus was not invited to opt but was deemed to belong to the Turkish community, because of its assumed common language (Turkish) and religion (Muslim) with the Turkish Cypriots. In 2009 the Roma community was recognised as a minority under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; this has not led however to any change in policy or positive action in their favour; the government continues not to recognise any migrant community as a \u2018minority\u2019 whilst the Welfare Services deem that the Roma community is far too small to deserve separate treatment. The Constitution functioned until 1963, when the Greek-Cypriot President proposed 13 amendments to it, effectively taking away the most basic rights of the Turkish-Cypriots. The Turkish-Cypriots reacted by withdrawing from the Government in protest and inter- ethnic violence ensued between 1963 and 1967. In 1964 the Supreme Court ruled that the functioning of the government must continue on the basis of the \u2018doctrine of necessity\u2019 which mainly provides for the \u2018suspension\u2019 of those constitutional provisions that guaranteed the rights of Turkish-Cypriots to be represented in decision-making. Between 1963 and 1974, a large number of Turkish-Cypriots gradually withdrew into enclaves. In 1974, following the military interventions from Greece and Turkey, division was further embedded. The three \u2018religious groups\u2019 stayed in the south with the Greek-Cypriots and the Roma joined the Turkish-Cypriots who were moved to the north, until early 2000, when many Roma returned to the south and settled in specifically designated Roma settlements, renowned for their squalor, poverty and bad state of repair. The housing segregation inevitably led to the schooling segregation of Roma children, who are obliged to attend schools close to their residence. Despite improvements to the housing situation and measures in education targeting the Roma, they remain the most socially excluded and vulnerable Cypriots. Few NGOs are active in the non-discrimination field. There are no NGOs for the rights of the Turkish Cypriots or the Roma and only 1-2 NGOs for the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. By far the most organised are the disability NGOs, whose lobbying actions are coordinated by a national confederation, which in 2006 was afforded the status of a social partner. However, in practice the confederation is being afforded little role in processes which are of key significance to it, such as the drafting and implementation of a 2009 law on quotas in employment and the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Until 2010 there was only one gay rights NGO, with only two of its members being \u2018out of the closet\u2019 to openly fight for gay rights; in 2010 a new gay rights NGO emerged, bringing together younger dynamic people who are open about their sexual orientation and holding public events. Although sexual orientation discrimination is widespread amongst Cypriot society, developments are finally picking up: after years of debates, a law was adopted recognising civil unions of couples outside marriage, covering both same sex couples and all other couples who choose a registered partnership for other reasons. 1 A number of neo Nazi groups appeared in recent years with a strong anti- immigrant discourse and regular implication in racial crime. One of these groups, ELAM was registered as a political party has for the past few years been contesting elections and winning a few thousand votes. 1 Cyprus, Law on Civil Marriages of 2015 ( O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 2015 ), 184(I)/2015, 9 December 2015.

        "6 2. Main legislation The Cypriot Constitution contains a general anti-discrimination provision (article 28) which corresponds to Article 14 of the ECHR, but includes additionally the ground of belonging to either the \u2018Greek\u2019 or the \u2018Turkish\u2019 community. Age, disability and sexual orientation are not explicitly covered by the Constitution, although they are deemed as included in the term \u201cany other ground whatsoever\u201d in article 28. Cyprus has ratified most major international conventions on discrimination. In 2000 the basic disability law came into force which included the prohibition of discrimination but did not provide for an implementation mechanism. In 2004 the two anti-discrimination directives were transposed into four separate national laws: \uf02d a law amending the existing disability law in order to bring it in line with the Employment Equality Directive; 2 \uf02d a law rendering discrimination in employment unlawful, roughly transposing the Employment Equality Directive on four grounds (i.e. excluding disability which is dealt with separately; 3 \uf02d a law rendering discrimination on the ground of racial/ethnic origin unlawful in the fields provided by Directive 2000/43 (except employment); 4 and \uf02d the law appointing the Ombudsman as the equality body empowered to investigate complaints of discrimination in accordance with article 13 of Directive 2000/43, the mandate of which goes well beyond the minimum prescribed by the said directive to include the safeguarding of rights guaranteed by the Constitution or by the Conventions ratified by Cyprus, which include Protocol 12 of the ECHR and most notably nationality. 5 However, the wide mandate of the Equality Body does not include the provision of independent assistance to victims or the power to represent victims in Court. In July 2006 the Cypriot Constitution was amended to give supremacy to EU laws. Until then, the Constitution was the supreme law of the country. Prior to that, the anti- discrimination provision of Article 28 of the Cypriot Constitution was interpreted by the Courts to mean that positive action violated the principle of equality enshrined in the Constitution. During 2015 judicial trend begun to shift towards recognising that positive action does not infringe the equality principle and that it is in fact a necessary element in order to achieve equality. 6 The most commonly used legal route to challenge discrimination remains the Constitution, rather than the laws transposing the equality acquis, as lawyers tend to rely primarily on Article 28 of the Constitution and largely ignore the anti- discrimination directives, which have rarely been invoked in Court. This sometimes leads to the emergence of legal norms of doubtful validity , like the use of concepts such as \u201creasonable discrimination\u201d which is allowed and necessary \u201cbecause of the special nature 2 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000).

        "7 of things.\u201d In 2014 there was a sharp decline in discrimination claims, attributed to the economic crisis, the general lowering of fundamental rights standards and the rising unemployment. Current practice suggests that the duty to ensure that discriminatory laws, provision or rules of organisations have been explicitly repealed, as required by the Equality directives, is not fully complied with. The process of formal repeal of laws or regulations is triggered off only after a complaint is submitted to the equality body. Even when a discriminatory legislative provision is reviewed in the framework of a judicial process, this does not trigger the procedure of revision. If the equality body finds that a provision is contrary to the directives, the procedure for repealing it does not always bear fruit. A decision issued by the Supreme Court in 2014 which established that the Attorney is not at liberty to ignore the Equality Body\u2019s recommendation for amendment of a discriminatory law, was promising to change the picture 7 but this did not happen in 2015. 3. Main principles and definitions All definitions of \u2018discrimination\u2019 contained in the directives are virtually replicated in the national laws. Thus, direct and indirect discrimination, harassment, instructions to discriminate and victimisation, which are prohibited on all five grounds, follow verbatim the definitions in the directives. Discrimination by association is not explicitly covered in the anti-discrimination laws, but is covered by Protocol 12 to the ECHR; in addition, equality body decisions in 2010 and in 2015 applied the principle established in Coleman , 8 extending the prohibition of disability discrimination to the primary carers of persons with disability even if they are not parents or spouses of the person with disability. 9 The laws transposing Directive 2000/78 allow for differential treatment based on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age, disability and sexual orientation when the nature of the particular occupational activities or the context within which these are carried out is such that a specific characteristic constitutes a substantial and determining employment precondition, provided that the aim is legitimate and the requirement proportionate. With regard to age, these provisions do not apply to the armed forces, to the extent that the fixing of an age limit is justified by the nature and the duties of the occupation. In practice, age limits apply in job recruitments and promotions, particularly within the police force, aimed less at serving labour market policy goals and more at addressing the deterioration of physical fitness of employees, which allegedly comes with age. In the case of occupational activities of churches or other public or private organizations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, a difference of treatment based on a person\u2019s religion or belief does not constitute discrimination when, due to the nature of the context of these activities, religion or belief is a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organization\u2019s ethos. 7 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Nicoletta Charalambidou v The Republic of Cyprus, the Finance Minister and the Attorney General (\u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 v. \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0395\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1), No. 1695/2009, 17 December 2014.

A.K.I. 38/2015. Available at www.ombudsman.gov.cy/Ombudsman/Ombudsman.nsf/All/3CC4BBB75B9F6404C2257EF5002290BF/$file/A KI_38_2015_16102015.doc?OpenElement. ",
        "8 The scope of the Law on Persons with Disabilities excludes activities where, by virtue of their nature or context, a characteristic or ability which a person with a disability does not have, constitutes a substantial and determining precondition, provided the aim is legitimate and the precondition is proportionate, taking into consideration the possibility of adopting \u2018reasonable measures\u2019, within the meaning which these take in this law. The law does not apply to the armed forces, to the extent that the nature of the occupation is such that it requires special skills which cannot be exercised by persons with disabilities. 10 The disability law was amended in 2007 to impose an obligation on employers to provide reasonable accommodation so long as the burden on the employer is not disproportionate. The law was further amended in 2014 in order to extend the duty to provide reasonable accommodation to fields beyond employment, provided the burden is not disproportionate or unjustified. 11 The fields of application of the new duty to provide reasonable accomodation are: the right to independent living, diagnosis and prevention of disability, personal support with assistive equipment, services etc, accessibility to housing, buildings, streets, the environment, public means of transport, education, information and communication through special means, services for social and economic integration, vocational training, employment in the open market, etc (article 4); Equality in the provision of goods services and facilities where this is \u2018justified\u2019 (article 6); telephone services especially adapted for persons with disability and television programs accessible to deaf persons (article 8). There is no provision in the Cypriot legal order for multiple discrimination. 4. Material scope The anti-discrimination laws cover both the private and the public sector and include all fields provided in the directives. Thus, discrimination on all five grounds is forbidden in employment, access to vocational training, working conditions including pay, membership of trade unions or other associations. In addition, discrimination on the ground of racial/ethnic origin is forbidden in the field of social protection, medical care, social provision, education and access to goods and services available to the public including housing. Subject to conditions, the disability law provides for the right to equal treatment in the provision of goods, facilities and services. 5. Enforcing the law Victims have the option of submitting a complaint to the equality body or to the courts. Litigation could either take the form of an application for judicial review under article 146 of the Constitution, or to the district court or labour tribunal in accordance with the laws transposing the two directives, or to the district Court for violation of the constitutional anti-discrimination provision. Litigation is hardly ever used by vulnerable groups for various reasons: low awareness of the anti-discrimination laws amongst victims and legal circles, the high cost of litigation and restrictions in accessing legal aid which is subject to the \u2018means test\u2019, and the length of time involved. In 2013 and 2014, the number of employment-related complaints to the Equality Body dropped almost by half compared to previous years, which is attributed to the rising unemployment and the fear of victims that they may lose their jobs if they complain. From the body of decisions emerging in recent years, it appears that the more vulnerable the groups the less access they have to judicial or equality body proceedings. Thus most anti-discrimination claims brought before the Court are filed by civil servants regarding promotions, pensions and retirement ages. There are a few Court decisions concerning the claims of Turkish Cypriots to their properties in 10 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000).

        "9 the south or to state grants but no cases involving migrants or Roma claiming violation of the equality acquis . The limited resources allocated to the equality body has led to delays in investigating of complaints of up to three to four years; by then third party rights may have been created, rendering justice for the victim impossible, whilst the victim meanwhile becomes time- barred from applying to the courts. No binding decision was ever issued by the Equality Body and no sanction was ever imposed; in the majority of cases, the equality body prefers to use its mediation function, as sanctions are too low to act as a deterrent. In each annual report, the Equality Body dedicates a special section to describe its mediation efforts, setting out a number of examples of successful mediation. 12 The national laws transpose verbatim the directives\u2019 provisions regarding the right of organisations to engage in procedures on behalf of victims. Victims may address complaints directly to the equality body, where the procedure is cost-free, simple and flexible, or to NGOs or trade unions, who may then submit complaints to the equality body on their behalf. However, there are few NGOs available to file complaints on behalf of vulnerable groups and even fewer trade unions, some of whom tend to view the equality body with suspicion; for instance, the Equality Body reports that trade unions view with suspicion its interventions in labour related issues, which they interpret as an interference with the free bargaining of the terms of the collective agreements. 13 In general, more complaints are submitted by individuals rather than by organisations acting on their behalf. In the case of sexual orientation, most victims are \u2018closeted\u2019 and unwilling to submit complaints so as not to make their sexual orientation known to the public. There is no mention in the legislation, in case law, or in equality body decisions on the use of situation testing and statistical data. If an argument in favour of admitting such evidence is used in Court, it is likely to be allowed, although the Courts often do allow technicalities to place obstacles in the delivery of justice. The general rules of evidence for criminal and civil procedure apply. The admissibility of situation testing as a method of proving discrimination in courts will presumably be subjected to the general test of \u2018relevance\u2019 and \u2018the best evidence rule\u2019. However, it is not possible to state with certainty whether the courts will consider this as admissible evidence in order to prove discrimination. The burden of proof may be reversed in judicial proceedings where the laws transposing the directives are involved; a claimant who invokes the constitution or uses other laws as the basis of his or her claim cannot benefit from the principle of the reversal of the burden of proof. The burden of proof is not reversed in procedures before the equality body, since the latter\u2019s mandate includes the right to carry out investigations to establish facts. The sanctions which Courts can impose against physical persons found guilty of discrimination cannot exceed \u20ac 6,835.27 and/or imprisonment of up to six months. For legal persons the maximum penalty is \u20ac 1,196.72. If the offence has been committed out of gross negligence, the fine for physical persons is up to \u20ac 3,417.63. For legal persons the fine is again up to \u20ac 3,417.63 for the managing director, chairman, director, secretary or other officer if it can be proven that the offence was committed with his/her consent plus an additional fine of up to \u20ac 6,835.27 for the company or organisation. These fines, 12 See for example: Equality Authority Annual Report 2014, p. 16, available at http://www.ombudsman.gov.cy/Ombudsman/Ombudsman.nsf/All/9B52BD3F8AF79B31C2257F14003F805C?

        "10 however, can only be imposed by the Courts; the Equality Body can only impose small fines which cannot exceed \u20ac 598. The Equality body does not have the power to award compensation to victims of discrimination. 6. Equality bodies In 2004, the Ombudsman was appointed as the national equality body, empowered to combat racial discrimination as well as discrimination forbidden by law and generally discrimination on the grounds of race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs and national or ethnic origin; to promote equality of enjoyment of rights safeguarded by the Constitution or by the Conventions ratified by Cyprus (which include Protocol 12 of the ECHR and the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination) irrespective of race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs, national or ethnic origin; to promote equality of opportunity irrespective of the aforesaid grounds plus the grounds of special needs and sexual orientation. The scope of this provision covers not only the fields of Directive 2000/78 but additionally social insurance, medical care, education and access to goods and services including housing. Although a quasi-judicial body with powers to issue binding decisions, the Equality Body resorts to mediation and/or to non-binding recommendations as more effective means of tackling problems rather than the small fines foreseen in the law. It has the power to conduct independent surveys, compile reports and issue recommendations but lacks the power to offer independent assistance to victims, as required by the Racial Equality Directive. The equality body comprises of two departments: the Equality Authority, which deals with all grounds in the employment field and the Anti-discrimination Authority which deals with all grounds in all fields beyond employment. A number of new functions were added to its mandate from 2009 onwards without adding to its budget or resources. These functions include the National Human Rights Institute (NHRI), the independent mechanism for the prevention of torture, the independent mechanism for the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the independent authority for the implementation of the Return Directive. Insufficient funds allocated to the Equality Body\u2019s office resulted in inadequate staffing arrangements, in delays in issuing decisions, in an inability to conduct surveys, awareness campaigns, research or issue codes of conduct unless external funding is secured. 7. Key issues \uf02d The additional functions/mandate extensions assigned to the Equality Body/Ombudsman without an increase in its budget has led to considerable delays in decision making, to the extent that the effectiveness and impact of the institution is now at question. The freezing in recruitments to the public sector, imposed as a result of the economic crisis, has meant that it cannot hire personnel even if only to replace those who resign from the service. Also, many of the officers of the Equality Body are not legally trained, which is reflected in the reports published: references to laws and case law are usually lacking whilst legal responsibility for clearly unlawful acts is hardly ever pinned on the perpetrators. The shortages in human resources has also meant that the monitoring of compliance with the decisions is adversely affected. \uf02d The requirement of the Racial Equality Directive that the specialized body should be in a position to offer assistance to victims is still not transposed, more than 10 years after the directive was transposed, as the Equality Body cannot represent victims in Court. To be able to do so, in addition to a new mandate, the Equality Body should be afforded the necessary budget and human resources which it is now lacking. \uf02d Very rarely do discrimination cases make it to the courts. In those cases, where they do, the anti-discrimination legal framework is not being invoked; instead recourse is made to the 40-year old constitutional provisions (judicial review of administrative acts; and/or the general equality provision of article 28) which do not offer the far- ",
        "11 reaching protection of the directives. The decision is often based on problematic legal doctrines arbitrarily developed by the courts which do not comply with the directives and which deny victims the protection offered by the directives. \uf02d Litigation is not sufficiently used, owing to the cost and time length involved, the fact that legal aid is made available only subject to insufficient means, and to the lack of awareness of the anti-discrimination laws amongst the legal profession. Given the fact that the equality body\u2019s decisions so far were mere recommendations, victims of discrimination are, in practice, not afforded the mandatory legal protection foreseen in the directives. In recent years, the government has completely abandoned efforts to raise awareness about the directives, to promote anti-discrimination initiatives or to consult with civil society. The 2014-2020 package of the EU\u2019s structural funds will not be used to fund new projects promoting anti-discrimination but only to fund existing \u2018horizontal policies\u2019 for which the beneficiaries have expressed fierce criticism, like the disability classification system ICF. \uf02d There is no procedure in place for regular reviewing or revising of discriminatory laws/regulations. In practice, review is only triggered off once a complaint is submitted to the equality body. In such a case, the law requires the equality body to refer discriminatory laws/regulations to the Attorney General who is then under a duty to prepare the amending legislation. This procedure however is very rarely followed, to the effect that several discriminatory laws remain in place. \uf02d Issues deriving from the unresolved \u2018Cyprus problem\u2019 the de facto division of the country have been the source of on-going ethnic discrimination, particularly since the opening of the sealed border in 2003. These relate to the Turkish Cypriots\u2019 access to their properties in the south and the exercise of various constitutional rights, the violation of Greek-Cypriot (G/C) rights by Turkey and a certain tendency of the authorities and of the courts to \u201cseek revenge\u201d for the Turkish invasion of Cyprus by denying Turkish Cypriots basic fundamental rights. The G/C resentment of the constitutional quota system for T/Cs in the public sector, the history of ethnic conflict and the continuous application and expansion of the \u2018doctrine of necessity\u2019 by the authorities and the courts subordinates equality issues to political expediencies and place a disproportionately strong emphasis on state sovereignty. The equality body has so far been reluctant to address the extensive use of the \u2018doctrine of necessity\u2019 by the administration and by the Courts, which leads to serious systemic gaps and weaknesses in the realisation of equality.

        "12 R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 1. Introduction Chypre a acquis son ind\u00e9pendance en 1960 en se dotant d\u2019une Constitution qui \u00e9tablit un syst\u00e8me de strict partage des pouvoirs entre les \u00abGrecs\u00bb, d\u2019une part, et les \u00abTurcs\u00bb, d\u2019autre part. La Constitution reconna\u00eet ces deux \u00abcommunaut\u00e9s\u00bb, et trois \u00abgroupes religieux\u00bb: les maronites, les chr\u00e9tiens arm\u00e9niens et les latins. Les \u00abgroupes religieux\u00bb ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s d\u2019opter pour l\u2019une des \u00abcommunaut\u00e9s\u00bb et ont choisi l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 grecque. La communaut\u00e9 rom pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Chypre n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 faire de choix et les autorit\u00e9s ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elle appartenait \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 turque en raison de la langue (turque) et de la religion (islamique) qu\u2019elle est suppos\u00e9e partager avec les Chypriotes turcs. En 2009, la communaut\u00e9 rom a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue en tant que minorit\u00e9 au sens de la Convention-cadre pour la protection des minorit\u00e9s nationales, mais cela ne s\u2019est traduit par aucun changement en termes de politique ou d\u2019action positive en sa faveur. Le gouvernement ne reconna\u00eet aucune communaut\u00e9 immigr\u00e9e en tant que \u00abminorit\u00e9\u00bb et les services d\u2019aide sociale consid\u00e8rent que la communaut\u00e9 rom est beaucoup trop petite pour m\u00e9riter un traitement distinct. La Constitution a fonctionn\u00e9 jusqu\u2019en 1963, date \u00e0 laquelle le pr\u00e9sident chypriote grec a propos\u00e9 treize amendements ayant pour effet de priver les Chypriotes turcs de leurs droits les plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires. Ceux-ci ont r\u00e9agi en se retirant du gouvernement en signe de protestation et la situation a d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 en violences interethniques de 1963 \u00e0 1967. En 1964, la Cour supr\u00eame a dit pour droit que le gouvernement devait continuer de fonctionner sur la base de la \u00abdoctrine de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9\u00bb, qui pr\u00e9voit principalement la \u00absuspension\u00bb des dispositions constitutionnelles garantissant la repr\u00e9sentation des droits des Chypriotes turcs dans les prises de d\u00e9cisions politiques. Entre 1963 et 1974, de nombreux Chypriotes turcs se sont retir\u00e9s dans des enclaves. La division s\u2019est ancr\u00e9e davantage encore en 1974 par suite des interventions militaires de la Gr\u00e8ce et de la Turquie. Les trois \u00abgroupes religieux\u00bb sont rest\u00e9s dans le Sud avec les Chypriotes grecs, et les Roms ont rejoint les Chypriotes turcs, d\u00e9plac\u00e9s vers le Nord, jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2000 \u2013 \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle un grand nombre de Roms sont retourn\u00e9s dans le Sud pour s\u2019installer dans des implantations qui leur \u00e9taient sp\u00e9cifiquement destin\u00e9es et qui \u00e9taient connues pour leur \u00e9tat de mis\u00e8re et de d\u00e9labrement. La s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation en termes de logement a in\u00e9vitablement entra\u00een\u00e9 la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation \u00e9ducative des enfants roms, qui n\u2019avaient d\u2019autre choix que celui de s\u2019inscrire dans les \u00e9coles situ\u00e9es \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de leur domicile. Malgr\u00e9 les am\u00e9liorations en mati\u00e8re de logement et les mesures \u00e9ducatives \u00e0 l\u2019intention des Roms, ceux-ci demeurent les Chypriotes les plus vuln\u00e9rables et souffrant de la plus grande exclusion sociale. Peu d\u2019ONG exercent leur activit\u00e9 dans le domaine de la lutte contre les discriminations. Aucune ne s\u2019occupe de d\u00e9fendre les droits des Chypriotes turcs et des Roms, et une ou deux seulement se chargent de d\u00e9fendre les droits des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et des demandeurs d\u2019asile. Les ONG de loin les mieux organis\u00e9es sont celles qui traitent du handicap; leurs actions de lobbying sont coordonn\u00e9es par une conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale, qui a obtenu en 2006 le statut de partenaire social. En pratique toutefois, elle ne peut jouer qu\u2019un r\u00f4le tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9 dans les processus qui l\u2019int\u00e9ressent au premier plan, tels l\u2019\u00e9laboration et la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une loi de 2009 sur les quotas en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et l\u2019application de la Convention des Nations unies relative aux droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es. Jusqu\u2019en 2010, le pays ne comptait qu\u2019une seule ONG de d\u00e9fense des droits des homosexuels dont deux membres seulement \u00e9taient \u00absortis du placard\u00bb pour d\u00e9fendre ouvertement leurs droits. Une nouvelle ONG de d\u00e9fense des droits des homosexuels a vu le jour en 2010: elle regroupe des jeunes qui affichent ouvertement leur orientation sexuelle et organisent de nombreuses manifestations publiques. M\u00eame si la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019orientation sexuelle reste tr\u00e8s r\u00e9pandue au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 chypriote, des \u00e9volutions s\u2019amorcent enfin: apr\u00e8s des ann\u00e9es de d\u00e9bat, une loi reconnaissant les unions civiles de couples en dehors du mariage, qui couvre \u00e0 la fois les couples de m\u00eame sexe et tout couple choisissant un partenariat ",
        "13 enregistr\u00e9 pour d\u2019autres raisons, a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e. 14 Chypre a vu \u00e9merger ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es un certain nombre de groupes n\u00e9o-nazis tenant des discours fortement anti- immigrants et r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement impliqu\u00e9s dans des actes de violence raciale. L\u2019un de ces groupes (ELAM) a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit en tant que parti politique et se pr\u00e9sente aux \u00e9lections depuis quelques ann\u00e9es en remportant quelques milliers de voix. 2. L\u00e9gislation principale La Constitution chypriote contient une disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de lutte contre la discrimination (article 28) qui correspond \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la CEDH, mais inclut, en outre, le motif de l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 \u00abgrecque\u00bb ou \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 \u00abturque\u00bb. L\u2019\u00e2ge, le handicap et l\u2019orientation sexuelle ne sont pas explicitement couverts par la Constitution, m\u00eame s\u2019ils sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s inclus dans l\u2019expression \u00abtout autre motif quelconque\u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019article 28. Chypre a ratifi\u00e9 la plupart des grandes conventions internationales relatives \u00e0 la discrimination. Une loi fondamentale d\u00e9fendant les droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es, y compris l\u2019interdiction de toute discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en 2000, mais elle ne pr\u00e9voit aucun m\u00e9canisme de mise en \u0153uvre. Les deux directives de lutte contre la discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transpos\u00e9es en 2004 sous la forme de quatre lois nationales distinctes, \u00e0 savoir: \uf02d une loi modifiant la loi existante sur le handicap, afin d\u2019aligner cette derni\u00e8re sur les dispositions de la directive 2000/78/CE; 15 \uf02d une loi rendant ill\u00e9gale la discrimination dans le travail et l\u2019emploi, transposant grosso modo la directive 2000/78/CE en retenant quatre motifs de discrimination au lieu de cinq (le handicap \u00e9tant exclu car couvert par ailleurs); 16 \uf02d une loi rendant ill\u00e9gale toute discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019origine ethnique ou raciale dans les domaines couverts par la directive 2000/43/CE (sauf l\u2019emploi); 17 et \uf02d la loi d\u00e9signant le M\u00e9diateur en tant qu\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 enqu\u00eater sur les plaintes pour discrimination conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019article 13 de la directive 2000/43/CE; son mandat s\u2019\u00e9tend bien au- del\u00e0 des exigences minimales de ladite directive puisqu\u2019il inclut la protection des droits garantis par la Constitution ou par les conventions ratifi\u00e9es par Chypre comprenant le protocole n\u00ba 12 de la CEDH et surtout la nationalit\u00e9. 18 Le large mandat de l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019inclut cependant pas l\u2019apport d\u2019une aide ind\u00e9pendante aux victimes ni l\u2019habilitation \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter celles-ci en justice. La Constitution chypriote a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e en juillet 2006 afin de conf\u00e9rer la primaut\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation de l\u2019UE. Jusqu\u2019alors, la Constitution avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la loi supr\u00eame du pays et la disposition antidiscrimination figurant en son article 28 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par les tribunaux comme signifiant qu\u2019une action positive transgressait le principe d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 par la Constitution. On a observ\u00e9 en 2015 une r\u00e9orientation de cette tendance judiciaire puisqu\u2019il est admis d\u00e9sormais que l\u2019action positive n\u2019enfreint pas le principe 14 Chypre, loi n\u00b0 184(I)/2015 sur les mariages civils ( O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 ) du 9 d\u00e9cembre 2015.

Cette situation conduit parfois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mergence de normes juridiques d\u2019une validit\u00e9 douteuse: on peut citer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard le recours \u00e0 des notions telles que la \u00abdiscrimination raisonnable\u00bb autoris\u00e9e et n\u00e9cessaire \u00aben raison de la nature particuli\u00e8re des choses\u00bb. Une forte diminution du nombre de plaintes pour discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9e en 2014 \u2013 ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne que l\u2019on attribue \u00e0 la crise \u00e9conomique, \u00e0 l\u2019abaissement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des normes en mati\u00e8re de droits fondamentaux et \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e du ch\u00f4mage. La pratique actuelle fait penser que l\u2019obligation de veiller \u00e0 l\u2019abrogation explicite des lois, dispositions et r\u00e8glements d\u2019organisations ayant un caract\u00e8re discriminatoire, sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e par les directives sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, n\u2019est pas enti\u00e8rement respect\u00e9e.

M\u00eame l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du caract\u00e8re discriminatoire d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire n\u2019engendre pas de processus de r\u00e9vision. Lorsque l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 constate qu\u2019une disposition enfreint les directives, la proc\u00e9dure visant \u00e0 l\u2019abroger ne porte pas toujours ses fruits. On pouvait esp\u00e9rer qu\u2019un arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame en 2014, \u00e9tablissant que le Procureur ne peut se permettre d\u2019ignorer la recommandation de l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9clamant la modification d\u2019une loi discriminatoire, ferait \u00e9voluer cette situation, 20 mais il n\u2019en a rien \u00e9t\u00e9 en 2015. 3. Principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et d\u00e9finitions Toutes les d\u00e9finitions de la \u00abdiscrimination\u00bb figurant dans les directives sont quasiment reproduites dans la l\u00e9gislation nationale. C\u2019est ainsi que les d\u00e9finitions de la discrimination directe et indirecte, du harc\u00e8lement, de l\u2019injonction de discriminer et des r\u00e9torsions, qui sont interdits pour l\u2019ensemble des cinq motifs, suivent textuellement celles des directives. La discrimination par association n\u2019est pas explicitement couverte par les lois antidiscrimination, mais elle est couverte par le protocole n\u00b0 12 \u00e0 la Convention europ\u00e9enne des droits de l\u2019homme; des d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019organisme pour la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 ont appliqu\u00e9 en outre en 2010 et en 2015 le principe \u00e9tabli dans Coleman 21 en vertu duquel l\u2019interdiction de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le handicap s\u2019\u00e9tend aux aidants principaux de personnes handicap\u00e9es, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de parents ou de conjoints de ces derni\u00e8res. 22 19 Chypre, Cour supr\u00eame, Eleni Paroutsi c.

En pratique, des limites d\u2019\u00e2ge sont appliqu\u00e9es lors de l\u2019embauche et de la promotion professionnelle, au sein des forces de police en particulier: elles visent moins \u00e0 servir les objectifs du march\u00e9 du travail qu\u2019\u00e0 tenir compte de la d\u00e9gradation de l\u2019\u00e9tat physique du personnel que l\u2019avanc\u00e9e en \u00e2ge est cens\u00e9e causer.

        "16 Les lois antidiscrimination couvrent tant le secteur public que le secteur priv\u00e9 et l\u2019ensemble des domaines vis\u00e9s par les directives. Aussi la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un quelconque des cinq motifs est-elle interdite dans l\u2019emploi, l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la formation professionnelle, les conditions de travail, y compris la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et l\u2019affiliation \u00e0 un syndicat ou \u00e0 une autre association. De surcro\u00eet, la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019origine ethnique ou raciale est interdite dans le domaine de la protection sociale, des soins m\u00e9dicaux, des services sociaux, de l\u2019\u00e9ducation et de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux biens et services mis \u00e0 la disposition du public, y compris le logement. Sous certaines conditions, la loi relative aux personnes handicap\u00e9es accorde le droit \u00e0 un traitement \u00e9gal en mati\u00e8re de fourniture de biens, d\u2019\u00e9quipements et de services. 5. Mise en application de la loi Les victimes ont la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser plainte aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement ou aupr\u00e8s des tribunaux. Les contentieux peuvent prendre la forme d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le juridictionnel en vertu de l\u2019article 146 de la Constitution, ou d\u2019une requ\u00eate adress\u00e9e au tribunal de district ou au tribunal du travail conform\u00e9ment aux lois transposant les deux directives, ou d\u2019une requ\u00eate adress\u00e9e au tribunal de district pour non-respect d\u2019une disposition constitutionnelle antidiscrimination. De nombreuses raisons font cependant que les groupes vuln\u00e9rables saisissent rarement la justice: on peut citer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard la m\u00e9connaissance par les victimes et les milieux juridiques des dispositions l\u00e9gales en mati\u00e8re de lutte contre la discrimination, ainsi que le co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la dur\u00e9e des proc\u00e9dures et les restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019une assistance juridique, laquelle est soumise \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re de ressources. En 2013 et 2014, le nombre de plaintes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi adress\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 a chut\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s de moiti\u00e9 par rapport aux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, et ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e du ch\u00f4mage et \u00e0 la crainte des victimes de perdre leur emploi si elles portent plainte. Il ressort de la jurisprudence r\u00e9cente que plus les groupes sont vuln\u00e9rables, moins ils ont acc\u00e8s aux proc\u00e9dures judiciaires ou aux proc\u00e9dures relevant de l\u2019organisme pour la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. C\u2019est ainsi que la plupart des affaires dont les juridictions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisies concernaient des plaintes introduites par des fonctionnaires \u00e0 propos de leur promotion, de leur pension et de leur \u00e2ge d\u2019admission \u00e0 la retraite. Quelques d\u00e9cisions judiciaires ont concern\u00e9 les requ\u00eates de Turcs chypriotes r\u00e9clamant leurs biens dans le Sud, ou des subventions publiques, mais aucune n\u2019a concern\u00e9 des affaires dans lesquelles des migrants ou des Roms invoquent une violation de l\u2019acquis europ\u00e9en en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. Les maigres ressources allou\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement entra\u00eenent un retard dans l\u2019examen des plaintes qui peut aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 trois ou quatre ans \u2013 d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019issue duquel les droits des tiers peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis et il devient impossible de rendre justice \u00e0 la victime, dont le droit de recours en justice est frapp\u00e9 entre-temps de prescription.

L\u2019organisme pour la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 consacre un chapitre de chacun de ses rapports annuels \u00e0 la description des efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de m\u00e9diation en les illustrant de plusieurs exemples de cas o\u00f9 cette proc\u00e9dure a eu une issue positive. 25 Les lois nationales reprennent textuellement les dispositions des directives concernant le droit des organisations d\u2019engager des proc\u00e9dures au nom des victimes. Les victimes peuvent adresser leur plainte directement \u00e0 l\u2019organisme pour la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, dont les proc\u00e9dures sont gratuites, simples et souples, ou \u00e0 des ONG ou des syndicats, qui 25 Voir par exemple le rapport annuel 2014 de l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, p. 16, disponible sur http://www.ombudsman.gov.cy/Ombudsman/Ombudsman.nsf/All/9B52BD3F8AF79B31C2257F14003F805C?

En ce qui concerne l\u2019orientation sexuelle, la plupart des victimes ne sont \u00abpas sorties du placard\u00bb et ne sont d\u00e8s lors pas dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 introduire une plainte qui rendrait publique leur orientation sexuelle.

Lorsqu\u2019un argument en faveur de la recevabilit\u00e9 de ce type de preuve est utilis\u00e9 au tribunal, ladite preuve sera vraisemblablement autoris\u00e9e, m\u00eame si les juridictions ont tendance \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 des subtilit\u00e9s d\u2019ordre technique de faire obstacle \u00e0 la bonne administration de la justice.

La recevabilit\u00e9 du test de situation comme m\u00e9thode permettant de prouver une discrimination devant les tribunaux sera vraisemblablement soumise au test g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de \u00abpertinence\u00bb et de \u00abla r\u00e8gle de la meilleure preuve\u00bb, mais il est impossible d\u2019affirmer pour autant que les tribunaux consid\u00e9reront qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une preuve recevable pour prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination. La charge de la preuve peut \u00eatre renvers\u00e9e lors de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires lorsque sont invoqu\u00e9es les lois transposant les directives; une partie requ\u00e9rante invoquant la Constitution ou fondant sa plainte sur d\u2019autres lois ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir du principe du renversement de la charge de la preuve. Il n\u2019y a pas renversement de la charge de la preuve dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures devant l\u2019organisme pour la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que son mandat couvre le droit de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate pour \u00e9tablir des faits. Les sanctions que les tribunaux peuvent imposer aux personnes physiques coupables de discrimination ne peuvent d\u00e9passer 6 835,27 euros et/ou une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de six mois maximum. Pour les personnes morales, le montant maximum de l\u2019amende est de 1 196,72 euros. Si l\u2019infraction a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par n\u00e9gligence grave, l\u2019amende pour les personnes physiques peut atteindre 3 417,63 euros.

Le champ d\u2019application de cette disposition couvre non seulement les domaines vis\u00e9s par la directive 2000/78/CE, mais \u00e9galement la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, les soins m\u00e9dicaux, l\u2019\u00e9ducation et l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux biens et aux services, y compris le logement. Bien qu\u2019il soit un organe quasi-judiciaire habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 prononcer des d\u00e9cisions contraignantes, l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement recourt \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation et/ou \u00e0 des recommandations non contraignantes en tant que moyens plus efficaces de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes que les modestes amendes pr\u00e9vues par la loi. Il est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 mener des \u00e9tudes ind\u00e9pendantes, \u00e0 publier des rapports et \u00e0 formuler des recommandations, mais il n\u2019est pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 apporter une aide ind\u00e9pendante aux victimes \u2013 ce qu\u2019exige pourtant la directive sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 raciale. L\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement comprend deux services: l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, qui traite de tous les motifs dans le domaine de l\u2019emploi, et l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 pour la lutte contre la discrimination, qui s\u2019occupe de l\u2019ensemble des motifs dans tous les domaines hormis l\u2019emploi. Son mandat a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 en 2009 d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de nouvelles fonctions, mais son budget et ses ressources n\u2019en ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9es pour autant. Ces fonctions suppl\u00e9mentaires couvrent notamment l\u2019Institution nationale de protection des droits de l\u2019homme, le m\u00e9canisme ind\u00e9pendant pour la pr\u00e9vention de la torture, le m\u00e9canisme ind\u00e9pendant pour la mise en \u0153uvre de la Convention des Nations unies relative aux droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es et l\u2019autorit\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendante pour la mise en \u0153uvre de la directive \u00abretour\u00bb. En raison de l\u2019insuffisance des fonds qui lui sont allou\u00e9s, l\u2019organisme de promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement ne peut se doter d\u2019un personnel ad\u00e9quat; enregistre du retard dans le rendu de ses d\u00e9cisions; et ne peut mener des enqu\u00eates et des campagnes de sensibilisation, effectuer des recherches ou publier des codes de bonne conduite sans obtenir de financements externes. 7. Points essentiels \uf02d L\u2019\u00e9largissement des fonctions/du mandat \u00e0 remplir par l\u2019organisme pour la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9/le M\u00e9diateur sans augmentation de son budget engendre des retards consid\u00e9rables au niveau des d\u00e9cisions au point que l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et l\u2019impact de l\u2019institution sont aujourd\u2019hui mis en cause. Le gel du recrutement dans le secteur public, impos\u00e9 en raison de la crise \u00e9conomique, a eu pour effet que l\u2019organisme pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement/le M\u00e9diateur n\u2019a m\u00eame pas pu engager de personnel pour remplacer les personnes quittant son service. De surcro\u00eet, de nombreux responsables au sein de l\u2019organisme pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas de formation juridique, ce qui ressort clairement des rapports publi\u00e9s \u2013 lesquels ne font g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ni \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation ni \u00e0 la jurisprudence, et \u00e9pinglent rarement la responsabilit\u00e9 des auteurs d\u2019actes manifestement ill\u00e9gaux. La p\u00e9nurie de ressources humaines a \u00e9galement eu des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur le suivi de la bonne ex\u00e9cution des d\u00e9cisions. \uf02d L\u2019exigence de la directive sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 raciale stipulant que l\u2019organisme sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 doit \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019apporter une assistance aux victimes n\u2019est toujours pas transpos\u00e9e \u2013 plus de dix ans apr\u00e8s la transposition de la directive \u2013 puisque l\u2019organisme pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 ne peut repr\u00e9senter les victimes en justice. Pour y \u00eatre habilit\u00e9, cet organisme devrait \u00eatre dot\u00e9 non seulement d\u2019un nouveau mandat, mais \u00e9galement des ressources budg\u00e9taires et humaines n\u00e9cessaires, qui lui font actuellement d\u00e9faut. \uf02d Il est tr\u00e8s rare que des affaires de discrimination parviennent jusqu\u2019aux tribunaux et, lorsqu\u2019elles y arrivent, ce n\u2019est pas le cadre juridique antidiscrimination qui est invoqu\u00e9: il est plut\u00f4t fait appel \u00e0 des dispositions constitutionnelles datant de ",

La d\u00e9cision se fonde souvent sur des doctrines juridiques probl\u00e9matiques qui, arbitrairement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es par les tribunaux, ne se conformes pas aux directives et refusent aux victimes la protection pr\u00e9vue par celles- ci. \uf02d Plusieurs raisons sous-tendent le faible recours aux proc\u00e9dures judiciaires: le co\u00fbt et la dur\u00e9e des dites proc\u00e9dures; le fait qu\u2019une aide juridique soit uniquement accord\u00e9e en cas de ressources personnelles insuffisantes; et la m\u00e9connaissance de la l\u00e9gislation antidiscrimination au sein de la profession juridique. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019organisme pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jour que de simples recommandations, les victimes de discrimination ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pas, concr\u00e8tement, de la protection juridique obligatoire pr\u00e9vue par les directives.

Le paquet des fonds structurels de l\u2019UE pour la p\u00e9riode 2014-2020 ne servira pas \u00e0 financer de nouveaux projets de lutte contre la discrimination: ils seront uniquement utilis\u00e9s pour soutenir des \u00abpolitiques horizontales\u00bb existantes \u00e0 propos desquelles les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ont exprim\u00e9 les plus vives critiques (syst\u00e8me de classification du handicap (CIF) notamment). \uf02d Aucune proc\u00e9dure n\u2019est en place pour proc\u00e9der r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au r\u00e9examen ou \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision des lois/r\u00e9glementations discriminatoires. Dans la pratique, un r\u00e9examen n\u2019est d\u00e9clench\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019organisme pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. La l\u00e9gislation exige dans ce cas que l\u2019organisme pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 renvoie les lois/r\u00e9glementations discriminatoires en cause devant le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qui est tenu de pr\u00e9parer une modification l\u00e9gislative. Il est extr\u00eamement rare que cette proc\u00e9dure soit suivie, ce qui a pour cons\u00e9quence que plusieurs actes l\u00e9gislatifs discriminatoires demeurent en vigueur. \uf02d Les probl\u00e9matiques d\u00e9coulant de la non-r\u00e9solution de la \u00abquestion chypriote\u00bb, \u00e0 savoir la division de facto du pays, sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019une discrimination ethnique permanente, surtout depuis l\u2019ouverture en 2003 de la fronti\u00e8re jusque-l\u00e0 herm\u00e9tique. Il s\u2019agit notamment de l\u2019acc\u00e8s des Chypriotes turcs \u00e0 leurs biens dans le Sud et de l\u2019exercice de divers droits constitutionnels, de la violation des droits des Chypriotes grecs par la Turquie et d\u2019une certaine tendance des autorit\u00e9s et des tribunaux de \u00abse venger\u00bb de l\u2019invasion turque de Chypre en refusant certains droits fondamentaux aux Chypriotes turcs.

        "20 ZUSAMMENFASSUNG 1. Einleitung Zypern erhielt seine Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit im Jahr 1960 mit einer Verfassung, die ein System der Gewaltenteilung mit einer strengen kommunalen Trennung zwischen \u201eGriechen\u201c und \u201eT\u00fcrken\u201c begr\u00fcndet. Die Verfassung kennt zwei \u201eGemeinschaften\u201c, die Griechen und die T\u00fcrken, und drei \u201ereligi\u00f6se Gruppen\u201c, die Maroniten, die Armenier und Latiner. Die \u201ereligi\u00f6sen Gruppen\u201c, die sich f\u00fcr eine der beiden \u201eGemeinschaften\u201c entscheiden mussten, haben sich der griechischen Gemeinschaft angeschlossen. Die Roma-Gemeinschaft in Zypern erhielt keine Wahlm\u00f6glichkeit, sondern wurde aufgrund der Annahme einer gemeinsamen Sprache (T\u00fcrkisch) und Religion (Islam) zu den t\u00fcrkischen Zyprern gez\u00e4hlt. 2009 wurden die Roma als Minderheit gem\u00e4\u00df dem Rahmen\u00fcbereinkommen zum Schutz nationaler Minderheiten anerkannt; dies hat jedoch nicht zu einer neuen Politik oder zu positiven Ma\u00dfnahmen zugunsten der Roma gef\u00fchrt. Die Regierung erkennt weiterhin keine migrantische Gemeinschaft als \u201eMinderheit\u201c an und die Sozialdienste halten die Roma- Gemeinschaft f\u00fcr viel zu klein, um ihnen eine Sonderbehandlung zu gew\u00e4hren. Die Verfassung funktionierte bis 1963, als der zyperngriechische Pr\u00e4sident 13 Verfassungs\u00e4nderungen vorlegte und damit den Zypernt\u00fcrken die wichtigsten Grundrechte entzog. Die Zypernt\u00fcrken verlie\u00dfen daraufhin aus Protest die Regierung und die Jahre 1963 bis 1967 waren von einer Welle der Gewalt zwischen den beiden Ethnien gepr\u00e4gt. 1964 forderte der Oberste Gerichtshof in einem Urteil eine Fortsetzung der Regierung nach der \u201eDoktrin der Notwendigkeit\u201c, wobei im Wesentlichen die Verfassungsartikel, die das Recht der Zypernt\u00fcrken zur Teilhabe an politischen Entscheidungsprozessen begr\u00fcnden, \u201esuspendiert\u201c wurden. Zwischen 1963 und 1974 zog sich der Gro\u00dfteil der Zypernt\u00fcrken schrittweise in Enklaven zur\u00fcck. 1974 wurde die Teilung der Insel durch milit\u00e4rische Interventionen Griechenlands und der T\u00fcrkei weiter zementiert. Die drei \u201ereligi\u00f6sen Gruppen\u201c blieben im S\u00fcden bei den Zyperngriechen und die Roma schlossen sich den Zypernt\u00fcrken an, die in den Norden umsiedelten. Erst seit dem Jahr 2000 kehren viele Roma wieder in den S\u00fcden zur\u00fcck und lassen sich in speziellen Roma-Siedlungen nieder, die f\u00fcr Schmutz, Armut und schlechten Unterhalt ber\u00fcchtigt sind. Die Wohnsegregation f\u00fchrte unvermeidbar zur schulischen Segregation, weil die Kinder der Roma verpflichtet sind, Schulen in der N\u00e4he ihres Wohnorts zu besuchen. Trotz Verbesserungen der Wohnsituation und gezielter F\u00f6rderma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr Roma im Bildungsbereich bleiben die Roma die am st\u00e4rksten sozial ausgegrenzte und benachteiligte Gruppe in Zypern. Nur wenige NROs sind im Kampf gegen Diskriminierung aktiv. Es gibt keine NRO f\u00fcr die Rechte der Zypernt\u00fcrken oder der Roma und nur ein bis zwei NROs f\u00fcr die Rechte von Migranten oder Asylsuchenden. Am besten organisiert sind NROs, die sich f\u00fcr die Rechte von Menschen mit Behinderungen einsetzen. Ihre Lobbyarbeit wird von einem nationalen Verband koordiniert, der 2006 den Status eines Sozialpartners erhielt. In der Praxis wird der Verband in wichtige politische Prozesse, wie die Ausarbeitung und Umsetzung des Gesetzes von 2009 \u00fcber Quoten im Besch\u00e4ftigungsbereich und die Umsetzung des \u00dcbereinkommens \u00fcber die Rechte von Menschen mit Behinderungen, jedoch kaum einbezogen. Bis 2010 gab es nur eine NRO f\u00fcr die Rechte Homosexueller, von deren Mitgliedern sich nur zwei \u201egeoutet\u201c hatten und offen f\u00fcr Schwulenrechte eintraten. 2010 wurde eine neue NRO f\u00fcr die Rechte homosexueller Menschen gegr\u00fcndet, in der sich vor allem junge dynamische Menschen engagieren, die ihre sexuelle Ausrichtung offen leben und \u00f6ffentliche Veranstaltungen durchf\u00fchren. Obwohl Diskriminierung aufgrund der sexuellen Ausrichtung in der Gesellschaft Zyperns weit verbreitet ist, nimmt der Kampf dagegen endlich Fahrt auf: Nach jahrelanger Diskussion wurde ein Gesetz verabschiedet, das eingetragene Partnerschaften \u2013 sowohl f\u00fcr gleichgeschlechtliche Paare als auch f\u00fcr Paare, die sich aus anderen Gr\u00fcnden f\u00fcr eine solche Partnerschaft entscheiden \u2013 ",

Eine dieser Gruppen, die ELAM, ist als politische Partei registriert und konnte in den Wahlen der letzten Jahre mehrere tausend Stimmen gewinnen. 2. Wichtigste Gesetze Die zyprische Verfassung enth\u00e4lt ein allgemeines Diskriminierungsverbot (Artikel 28), das dem Artikel 14 der EMRK entspricht, jedoch als zus\u00e4tzlichen Diskriminierungsgrund die Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit zur \u201egriechischen\u201c oder \u201et\u00fcrkischen\u201c Gemeinschaft auff\u00fchrt. Alter, Behinderung und sexuelle Ausrichtungen werden in der Verfassung nicht ausdr\u00fccklich erw\u00e4hnt, man geht jedoch davon aus, dass sie durch die Formulierung \u201ealle sonstigen Gr\u00fcnde\u201c in Artikel 28 abgedeckt sind. Zypern hat die meisten wichtigen internationalen \u00dcbereinkommen gegen Diskriminierung ratifiziert. Im Jahr 2000 trat ein grundlegendes Behindertengesetz in Kraft, das ein Diskriminierungsverbot einf\u00fchrte, jedoch keine Mechanismen zu dessen Durchsetzung. 2004 wurden die beiden Antidiskriminierungsrichtlinien in vier gesonderten zyprischen Gesetzen umgesetzt: \uf02d ein Gesetz zur Anpassung des bestehenden Behindertengesetzes an die Richtlinie zur Gleichbehandlung im Bereich der Besch\u00e4ftigung; 28 \uf02d ein Gesetz, das Diskriminierung im Besch\u00e4ftigungsbereich verbietet und die wesentlichen Punkte der Richtlinie zur Gleichbehandlung im Bereich der Besch\u00e4ftigung f\u00fcr vier Diskriminierungsgr\u00fcnde umsetzt (d. h. nicht den Grund Behinderung, der gesondert behandelt wird); 29 \uf02d ein Gesetz, das Diskriminierung aufgrund der Rasse bzw. der ethnischen Herkunft in den sachlichen Anwendungsbereichen der Richtlinie 2000/43/EG verbietet (au\u00dfer Besch\u00e4ftigung) 30 und \uf02d das Gesetz, das den Ombudsmann zur Gleichbehandlungsstelle ernennt, die f\u00fcr die Untersuchung von Diskriminierungsbeschwerden nach Artikel 13 der Richtlinie 2000/43 zust\u00e4ndig ist. Seine Zust\u00e4ndigkeit geht \u00fcber die Mindestanforderung der Richtlinie hinaus und umfasst den Schutz der Rechte, die durch die Verfassung oder die von Zypern ratifizierten \u00dcbereinkommen, einschlie\u00dflich des 12. Protokolls der EMRK, garantiert werden und insbesondere Schutz vor Diskriminierung aufgrund der Nationalit\u00e4t. 31 Allerdings f\u00e4llt unter die Zust\u00e4ndigkeit der Gleichbehandlungsstelle nicht die unabh\u00e4ngige Unterst\u00fctzung von Diskriminierungsopfern oder die Vertretung dieser Opfer vor Gericht. Im Juli 2006 erhielt das EU-Recht durch eine Verfassungs\u00e4nderung Vorrang vor dem nationalen Recht. Bis dahin war die Verfassung das oberste Gesetz des Landes. Vor dieser \u00c4nderung legten die Gerichte das Diskriminierungsverbot in Artikel 28 der zyprischen Verfassung als absoluten Gleichbehandlungsgrundsatz aus, der auch keine positiven Ma\u00dfnahmen erlaubt. 2015 begann sich in der Rechtsprechung zunehmend die Sichtweise durchzusetzen, dass positive Ma\u00dfnahmen nicht gegen den Gleichheitsgrundsatz versto\u00dfen, 27 Zypern, Gesetz \u00fcber die b\u00fcrgerliche Ehe von 2015 ( O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 2015 ), 184(I)/2015, 9.

        "22 sondern vielmehr ein notwendiges Element sind, um Gleichstellung zu erreichen. 32 Der am h\u00e4ufigsten beschrittene Rechtsweg, um gegen Diskriminierung vorzugehen, ist nach wie vor die Verfassung und nicht die Gesetze, mit denen der Besitzstand in Sachen Gleichstellung umgesetzt wurde: Anw\u00e4lte st\u00fctzen sich in der Regel vor allem auf Artikel 28 der Verfassung, w\u00e4hrend die Antidiskriminierungsrichtlinien weitgehend unber\u00fccksichtigt bleiben und vor Gericht bisher nur selten herangezogen wurden. Dies f\u00fchrte zur Entstehung von Rechtsnormen von zweifelhafter G\u00fcltigkeit , bei denen unter anderem Begriffe wie \u201eangemessene Diskriminierung\u201c verwendet werden, die \u201eaufgrund der speziellen Umst\u00e4nde\u201c erlaubt und notwendig ist. Im Jahr 2014 fiel die Zahl der Diskriminierungsklagen stark ab, vorwiegend aufgrund der Wirtschaftskrise, der allgemeinen Verminderung von Menschenrechtsstandards und der steigenden Arbeitslosigkeit. Die aktuelle Rechtspraxis deutet darauf hin, dass die auch in den Gleichbehandlungsrichtlinien geforderte Pflicht zur Aufhebung diskriminierender Gesetze, Vorschriften oder Satzungen nicht zur G\u00e4nze umgesetzt wird. Verfahren zur formellen Aufhebung von Gesetzen oder Vorschriften werden nur nach entsprechenden Beschwerden bei der Gleichstellungsstelle eingeleitet. Selbst wenn eine diskriminierende Rechtsvorschrift im Rahmen eines Verfahrens \u00fcberpr\u00fcft wird, f\u00fchrt dies nicht automatisch zu einer \u00dcberarbeitung der Vorschrift. Wenn die Gleichbehandlungsstelle der Ansicht ist, dass eine Vorschrift gegen die Richtlinien verst\u00f6\u00dft, tr\u00e4gt das Verfahren zu deren Aufhebung nicht in jedem Fall Fr\u00fcchte. Ein Urteil des Obersten Gerichtshof von 2014, nach dem der Staatsanwalt die Empfehlungen der Gleichbehandlungsstelle zur \u00dcberarbeitung diskriminierender Gesetze nicht einfach ignorieren darf, lie\u00df Hoffnung aufkommen, dass sich die Situation ver\u00e4ndern w\u00fcrde, 33 was 2015 jedoch nicht geschah. 3. Wichtigste Grunds\u00e4tze und Begriffe Alle Definitionen von Diskriminierung in den Richtlinien werden in den zyprischen Gesetzen praktisch wiederholt. Das hei\u00dft, die Bestimmungen zu unmittelbarer und mittelbarer Diskriminierung, Bel\u00e4stigung, Anweisung zur Diskriminierung und Viktimisierung, die f\u00fcr alle f\u00fcnf Diskriminierungsgr\u00fcnde verboten sind, folgen w\u00f6rtlich den Definitionen der Richtlinien. Diskriminierung durch Assoziierung wird in den Antidiskriminierungsgesetzen nicht ausdr\u00fccklich erfasst, wohl aber im 12. Protokoll der EMRK; au\u00dferdem ergingen 2010 und 2015 Entscheidungen der Gleichbehandlungsstelle, in denen der in Coleman 34 aufgestellte Grundsatz angewandt und das Verbot von Diskriminierung aufgrund einer Behinderung auf Personen ausgeweitet wurde, die das Sorgerecht f\u00fcr eine Person mit Behinderung aus\u00fcben, auch wenn sie nicht deren Eltern oder Ehepartner sind. 35 32 Zypern, Oberster Gerichtshof, Eleni Paroutsi gegen den Ausschuss f\u00fcr Unterricht und Erziehung , Rechtssache Nr. 5700/2013, 30.

        "23 Die Gesetze zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie 2000/78/EG erlauben Ungleichbehandlung aufgrund von Rasse oder ethnischer Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit, Religion oder Weltanschauung, Alter, Behinderung und sexueller Ausrichtung, wenn das Merkmal aufgrund der Art einer bestimmten beruflichen T\u00e4tigkeit oder der Bedingungen ihrer Aus\u00fcbung eine wesentliche und entscheidende berufliche Anforderung darstellt, sofern es sich um einen rechtm\u00e4\u00dfigen Zweck und eine angemessene Anforderung handelt. In Bezug auf Alter gilt diese Bestimmung nicht f\u00fcr die Streitkr\u00e4fte, sofern die Festlegung einer Altersgrenze durch Art und Pflichten der T\u00e4tigkeit gerechtfertigt ist. In der Praxis kommen Altersgrenzen bei Einstellungs- und Bef\u00f6rderungsverfahren vor, insbesondere bei der Polizei; sie dienen weniger der Erreichung arbeitsmarktpolitischer Ziele, sondern sind eine Reaktion auf die Verschlechterung der k\u00f6rperlichen Fitness der Angestellten, die mit dem Alter assoziiert wird. In Bezug auf berufliche T\u00e4tigkeiten innerhalb von Kirchen und anderen \u00f6ffentlichen oder privaten Organisationen, deren Ethos auf religi\u00f6sen Grunds\u00e4tzen oder Weltanschauungen beruht, stellt eine Ungleichbehandlung wegen der Religion oder Weltanschauung einer Person keine Diskriminierung dar, wenn die Religion oder die Weltanschauung nach der Art dieser T\u00e4tigkeiten oder der Umst\u00e4nde ihrer Aus\u00fcbung eine wesentliche, rechtm\u00e4\u00dfige und gerechtfertigte berufliche Anforderung angesichts des Ethos der Organisation darstellt. Das Behindertengesetz gilt nicht f\u00fcr T\u00e4tigkeiten, bei denen eine bestimmte F\u00e4higkeit aufgrund der Art der T\u00e4tigkeit oder der Bedingungen ihrer Aus\u00fcbung eine wesentliche und entscheidende Voraussetzung darstellt, sofern es sich um einen rechtm\u00e4\u00dfigen Zweck handelt und die Voraussetzung angemessen ist, wobei die M\u00f6glichkeit \u201eangemessener Vorkehrungen\u201c im Sinne des Gesetzes ber\u00fccksichtigt werden muss. Es gilt insoweit nicht f\u00fcr die Streitkr\u00e4fte, als eine T\u00e4tigkeit von ihrer Art her spezielle Fertigkeiten erfordert, die Personen mit Behinderung nicht aufweisen. 36 Im Behindertengesetz wurde 2007 eine Pflicht f\u00fcr Arbeitgeber eingef\u00fchrt, angemessene Vorkehrungen zu treffen, sofern diese den Arbeitgeber nicht unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig belasten. Im Jahr 2014 wurde diese Pflicht zu angemessenen Vorkehrungen auf weitere Lebensbereiche ausgedehnt, sofern dies den Betreffenden nicht unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig und ungerechtfertigt belastet. 37 Die Pflicht zu angemessenen Vorkehrungen gilt in den folgenden Bereichen: das Recht auf eine eigenst\u00e4ndige Lebensf\u00fchrung, Diagnose und Pr\u00e4vention von Behinderungen, pers\u00f6nliche Unterst\u00fctzung durch Hilfsmittel, Dienstleistungen usw., barrierefreier Zugang zu Wohnraum, Geb\u00e4uden, Stra\u00dfen, der Umwelt, \u00f6ffentlichen Transportmitteln, Bildung, Information und Kommunikation \u00fcber spezielle Mittel, Dienstleistungen zur sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Eingliederung, berufliche Bildung, Besch\u00e4ftigung auf dem offenen Arbeitsmarkt usw. (Artikel 4), Gleichstellung beim Zugang zu G\u00fctern, Dienstleistungen und Einrichtungen, sofern dies \u201egerechtfertigt\u201c ist (Artikel 6), spezielle Telefondienstleistungen f\u00fcr Menschen mit Behinderungen und Fernsehprogramme, die geh\u00f6rlosen Personen zug\u00e4nglich sind (Artikel 8). Das zyprische Rechtssystem enth\u00e4lt keine Bestimmungen \u00fcber Mehrfachdiskriminierung. 4. Sachlicher Anwendungsbereich Die Antidiskriminierungsgesetze gelten f\u00fcr den privaten und den \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor und decken alle in den Richtlinien geforderten Bereiche ab. Das hei\u00dft Diskriminierung wegen aller f\u00fcnf Diskriminierungsgr\u00fcnde ist in der Besch\u00e4ftigung, beim Zugang zu beruflicher Bildung, bei den Arbeitsbedingungen und Geh\u00e4ltern und bei der Mitgliedschaft in Gewerkschaften und anderen Vereinigungen verboten.

Unter bestimmten Bedingungen garantiert das Behindertengesetz das Recht auf Gleichbehandlung bei der Bereitstellung von G\u00fctern, Einrichtungen und Dienstleistungen. 5. Rechtsdurchsetzung Opfer k\u00f6nnen eine Klage bei der Gleichbehandlungsstelle oder bei Gericht einreichen. Sie k\u00f6nnen entweder einen Antrag auf richterliche Kontrolle nach Artikel 146 der Verfassung stellen, vor einem Amts- oder Arbeitsgericht eine Klage aufgrund eines der Gesetze einreichen, die die beiden Richtlinien umsetzen, oder vor dem Amtsgericht wegen eines Versto\u00dfes gegen das in der Verfassung verankerte Gleichbehandlungsgebot klagen. Aus den folgenden Gr\u00fcnden reichen besonders benachteiligte Gruppen nur selten Klagen ein: geringe Kenntnis der Antidiskriminierungsgesetze bei Opfern und in Rechtskreisen, hohe Prozesskosten und beschr\u00e4nkter Zugang zu Prozesskostenhilfe, die von \u201eMittelpr\u00fcfung\u201c und der Dauer des Verfahrens abh\u00e4ngt. 2013 und 2014 fiel die Anzahl der Beschwerden aus dem Besch\u00e4ftigungsbereich bei der Gleichbehandlungsstelle um fast die H\u00e4lfte im Vergleich zu den Vorjahren. Dies liegt vermutlich an der steigenden Arbeitslosigkeit und der Angst der Opfer, ihre Stelle zu verlieren, wenn sie sich beschweren. Die Urteile der letzten Jahre deuten darauf hin, dass eine Gruppe umso weniger Zugang zu Rechtsverfahren oder Verfahren vor der Gleichbehandlungsstelle hat, je st\u00e4rker sie benachteiligt ist. Die meisten Diskriminierungsklagen vor Gericht werden von Beamten eingereicht und betreffen Bef\u00f6rderungen, Pensionen und das Pensionsalter. Es gibt einige wenige Gerichtsurteile \u00fcber die Anspr\u00fcche von Zypernt\u00fcrken auf Immobilien im S\u00fcden oder auf staatliche Zusch\u00fcsse, aber keine F\u00e4lle, in denen Migranten oder Roma aufgrund von Verst\u00f6\u00dfen gegen den Besitzstand der Union im Bereich der Gleichbehandlung klagen. Infolge der begrenzten Mittel der Gleichbehandlungsstelle kann die Untersuchung von Beschwerden im schlimmsten Fall drei bis vier Jahre dauern. In dieser Zeit entstehen m\u00f6glicherweise Rechte Dritter, wodurch das Opfer seine Rechte nicht mehr durchsetzen kann und das Vergehen gleichzeitig verj\u00e4hrt ist. Die Gleichbehandlungsstelle hat noch nie rechtskr\u00e4ftige Urteile gesprochen oder Sanktionen verh\u00e4ngt. In der Mehrzahl der F\u00e4lle nimmt die Gleichbehandlungsstelle lieber eine Schlichterrolle ein, weil ihre Sanktionsm\u00f6glichkeiten zu gering sind, um abschreckend zu wirken. In jedem Jahresbericht widmet die Gleichbehandlungsstelle einen speziellen Abschnitt den gef\u00fchrten Schlichtungsverfahren und z\u00e4hlt eine Reihe gelungener Schlichtungen auf. 38 Das zyprische Recht setzt die Bestimmungen der Richtlinien \u00fcber die Rechte von Organisationen zur Beteiligung an Verfahren im Namen von Opfern wortw\u00f6rtlich um. Opfer k\u00f6nnen ihre Beschwerde direkt an die Gleichbehandlungsstelle richten, deren Verfahren kostenlos, einfach und flexibel ist, oder an NROs oder Gewerkschaften, die in ihrem Namen bei der Gleichbehandlungsstelle Beschwerde einreichen. Allerdings gibt es nur wenige NROs, die im Namen benachteiligter Gruppen Beschwerden einreichen, und noch weniger Gewerkschaften. Einige Gewerkschaften stehen der Gleichbehandlungsstelle kritisch gegen\u00fcber. So berichtet die Gleichbehandlungsstelle beispielsweise, dass Gewerkschaften ihre Einlassungen zu Themen im Bereich Besch\u00e4ftigung als Behinderung der freien Tarifverhandlungen auffassen. 39 Grunds\u00e4tzlich werden mehr Beschwerden von 38 Siehe z.

        "25 Einzelpersonen eingereicht, als von Organisation, die einzelne Opfer vertreten. Wenn es um die sexuelle Ausrichtung geht, bekennen sich die meisten Opfer nicht dazu, sondern scheuen vor einer Beschwerde zur\u00fcck, um ihre sexuelle Ausrichtung nicht \u00f6ffentlich bekannt zu machen. Weder in den Rechtsvorschriften noch im Fallrecht oder in den Entscheidungen der Gleichbehandlungsstelle wird die Verwendung von Situationstests oder statistischen Daten erw\u00e4hnt. Allerdings d\u00fcrften die Gerichte diese Verfahren vermutlich als Beweise zulassen, obwohl sie den Lauf der Gerechtigkeit gerne mit Formalit\u00e4ten behindern. Es gelten die \u00fcblichen Beweisregeln f\u00fcr Straf- und Zivilverfahren. Ob Situationstests zum Nachweis von Diskriminierung vor Gericht zugelassen werden, wird vermutlich durch die \u00fcbliche Pr\u00fcfung der \u201eRelevanz\u201c und nach der Regel der \u201ebesten Beweise\u201c entschieden. Daher l\u00e4sst sich nicht mit Sicherheit sagen, ob die Gerichte diese Form der Beweisf\u00fchrung zum Nachweis von Diskriminierung zulassen. Bei Gerichtsverfahren, die sich auf die Gesetze zur Umsetzung der Richtlinien beziehen, ist die Beweislast umgekehrt. Kl\u00e4gern, die ihre Klage auf die Verfassung oder andere Gesetze st\u00fctzen, kommt das Prinzip der umgekehrten Beweislast nicht zugute. Auch bei den Verfahren von der Gleichbehandlungsstelle ist die Beweislast nicht umgekehrt, da die Stelle daf\u00fcr zust\u00e4ndig ist, die Tatsachen durch Untersuchungen festzustellen. Nat\u00fcrliche Personen, die vor Gericht wegen Diskriminierung schuldig gesprochen werden, k\u00f6nnen zu einer Geldstrafe von h\u00f6chstens 6835,27 Euro und/oder bis zu sechs Monaten Haft verurteilt werden. Bei juristischen Personen liegt der H\u00f6chstbetrag bei 1196,72 Euro. Wenn die Tat aus grober Fahrl\u00e4ssigkeit begangen wurde, bel\u00e4uft sich die Geldstrafe f\u00fcr nat\u00fcrliche Personen auf 3417,63 Euro. F\u00fcr juristische Person erh\u00f6ht sich die Geldstrafe auf 3417,63 Euro f\u00fcr Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer, Vorsitzende, Direktoren, Sekret\u00e4re oder andere F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte, wenn nachgewiesen werden kann, dass die Tat mit deren Zustimmung erfolgt ist, zuz\u00fcglich einer weiteren Geldstrafe von bis zu 6835,27 Euro f\u00fcr das Unternehmen bzw. die Beh\u00f6rde. Diese Geldstrafen k\u00f6nnen allerdings nur von Gerichten verh\u00e4ngt werden, die Gleichbehandlungsstelle kann nur kleine Geldbu\u00dfen bis zu 598 Euro verh\u00e4ngen. Die Gleichbehandlungsstelle kann den Opfern von Diskriminierung keine Entsch\u00e4digung zusprechen. 6. Gleichbehandlungsstellen Im Jahr 2004 wurde der Ombudsmann zur nationalen Gleichbehandlungsstelle ernannt. Zu seiner Zust\u00e4ndigkeit geh\u00f6ren der Kampf gegen Rassendiskriminierung, gesetzlich verbotene Diskriminierung und allgemein gegen Diskriminierung aufgrund der Rasse, Gemeinschaft, Sprache, Hautfarbe, Religion, politischen oder sonstigen \u00dcberzeugung und nationaler oder ethnischer Herkunft, die F\u00f6rderung der Gleichstellung bei Aus\u00fcbung der Rechte, die durch die Verfassung oder die von Zypern ratifizierten \u00dcbereinkommen (zu denen auch das 12. Protokolle der EMRK und das \u00dcbereinkommen zur Beseitigung jeder Form von Rassendiskriminierung geh\u00f6ren) ungeachtet der Rasse, Gemeinschaft, Sprache, Hautfarbe, Religion, politischen oder sonstigen \u00dcberzeugung und nationaler oder ethnischer Herkunft sowie die F\u00f6rderung der Chancengleichheit ungeachtet der eben genannten Gr\u00fcnde sowie ungeachtet besonderer Bed\u00fcrfnisse und der sexuellen Ausrichtung. Dabei umfasst seine Zust\u00e4ndigkeit nicht nur die Anwendungsbereiche der Richtlinie 2000/78/EG, sondern auch die Bereiche Sozialversicherung, Gesundheitsdienste, Bildung und den Zugang zu G\u00fctern und Dienstleistungen, einschlie\u00dflich von Wohnraum. Obwohl die Gleichstellungsstelle als au\u00dfergerichtliche Stelle befugt ist, verbindliche Urteile zu sprechen, nutzt sie im Kampf f\u00fcr Gleichstellung statt der im Gesetz vorgesehenen geringen Geldbu\u00dfen lieber die Mittel der Mediation und/oder nicht verbindliche Empfehlungen. Die Stelle kann unabh\u00e4ngige Studien durchf\u00fchren, Berichte erstellen und %CF%82-%CE%95%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%B1%20%CE%95%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B 5%CF%83%CE%B7%202007-2008.pdf. ",
        "26 Empfehlungen aussprechen, ist jedoch nicht berechtigt, Opfern unabh\u00e4ngige Unterst\u00fctzung anzubieten, wie von der Richtlinie zur Gleichbehandlung ohne Unterschied der Rasse gefordert. Die Gleichbehandlungsstelle besteht aus zwei Abteilungen: der Gleichstellungsbeh\u00f6rde, die Diskriminierung aus allen Gr\u00fcnden im Bereich Besch\u00e4ftigung behandelt, und der Antidiskriminierungsstelle, die die \u00fcbrigen Anwendungsbereiche abdeckt. Seit 2009 hat die Stelle einige neue Funktionen \u00fcbernommen, wobei weder ihre Mittel noch ihre Ressourcen aufgestockt wurden. Zu diesen Funktionen geh\u00f6ren die einer nationalen Menschenrechtsinstitution (NHRI), unabh\u00e4ngige Mechanismen zur Pr\u00e4vention von Folter, ein unabh\u00e4ngiger Mechanismus zur Umsetzung des \u00dcbereinkommens \u00fcber die Rechte von Menschen mit Behinderungen der Vereinten Nationen und die Funktion einer unabh\u00e4ngigen Stelle f\u00fcr die Umsetzung der R\u00fcckf\u00fchrungsrichtlinie. Da der Gleichbehandlungsstelle nur ungen\u00fcgende Mittel und damit zu geringe personelle Ressourcen zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen, trifft sie Entscheidungen erst nach langer Wartezeit und kann Befragungen, Aufkl\u00e4rungskampagnen, Forschungsprojekte oder die Erstellung von Verhaltenskodizes nur mit Hilfe externer Finanzierung leisten. 7. Wichtige Punkte \uf02d Die zus\u00e4tzlichen Aufgaben und Zust\u00e4ndigkeiten der Gleichbehandlungsstelle bzw. des Ombudsmanns ohne entsprechende Budgeterh\u00f6hungen haben dazu gef\u00fchrt, dass Entscheidungen extrem lange auf sich warten lassen und inzwischen Effizienz und Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit der Stelle insgesamt in Frage stehen. Aufgrund einer Einstellungssperre f\u00fcr den \u00f6ffentlichen Dienst, die als Reaktion auf die Wirtschaftskrise eingef\u00fchrt wurde, kann sie inzwischen nicht einmal mehr ausscheidende Mitarbeiter ersetzen. Auch haben viele Beamte der Gleichbehandlungsstelle keine juristische Ausbildung, was sich in ihren Berichten niederschl\u00e4gt: Es fehlen Verweise auf Gesetze und Fallrecht und T\u00e4ter m\u00fcssen so gut wie nie die rechtliche Verantwortung f\u00fcr eindeutig rechtswidrige Handlungen \u00fcbernehmen. Die fehlenden personellen Mittel schr\u00e4nken auch die F\u00e4higkeit der Stelle ein, die Umsetzung der eigenen Entscheidungen zu kontrollieren. \uf02d Die Vorgabe der Richtlinie zur Gleichbehandlung ohne Unterschied der Rasse, dass die zust\u00e4ndige Stelle Opfern Unterst\u00fctzung anbieten soll, ist auch \u00fcber 10 Jahre nach der Umsetzung der Richtlinie noch nicht erf\u00fcllt, weil die Gleichbehandlungsstelle Opfer vor Gericht nicht vertreten darf. Um dies zu erm\u00f6glichen, w\u00fcrde die Gleichbehandlungsstelle neben einem neuen Mandat auch die notwendigen finanziellen und personellen Mittel ben\u00f6tigen, die derzeit noch fehlen. \uf02d Diskriminierungsf\u00e4lle werden nur sehr selten vor Gericht gebracht. Wenn dies dennoch geschieht, berufen sich die Kl\u00e4ger nicht auf die Antidiskriminierungsgesetze, sondern auf die 40 Jahre alten Verfassungsregeln (richterliche Kontrolle beh\u00f6rdlicher Entscheidungen und/oder das allgemeine Gleichbehandlungsgebot in Artikel 28), die nicht denselben weitreichenden Rechtsschutz gew\u00e4hren wie die Richtlinien. Urteile beruhen h\u00e4ufig auf einer problematischen Rechtslehre, die von den Gerichten willk\u00fcrlich entwickelt wurde, gegen die Richtlinien verst\u00f6\u00dft und den Opfern den von den Richtlinien garantierten Schutz verweigert. \uf02d Aufgrund der hohen Kosten und langen Verfahrensdauern, der Tatsache, dass Prozesskostenhilfe nur Personen gew\u00e4hrt wird, die nicht selbst \u00fcber die n\u00f6tigen Mittel verf\u00fcgen, und der mangelhaften Kenntnis der Antidiskriminierungsgesetze unter Juristen werden nur selten Klagen eingereicht. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass die Urteile der Gleichbehandlungsstelle bisher blo\u00dfe Empfehlungen darstellen, genie\u00dfen die Opfer von Diskriminierung in der Praxis nicht den Rechtsschutz, der ihnen nach den Richtlinien zusteht. In den vergangenen Jahren hat die Regierung s\u00e4mtliche Ma\u00dfnahmen eingestellt, die die Bekanntheit der Richtlinie erh\u00f6hen, Initiativen zur Bek\u00e4mpfung von Diskriminierung f\u00f6rdern oder die Zivilgesellschaft in den politischen Prozess einbeziehen sollten. Der Strukturfonds der EU f\u00fcr 2014-2020 wird nicht zur Finanzierung neuer Projekte zum Kampf gegen Diskriminierung eingesetzt, sondern ",

Vorschriften. Verfahren zur formellen Aufhebung von Gesetzen oder Vorschriften werden nur nach entsprechenden Beschwerden bei der Gleichstellungsstelle eingeleitet. In diesem Fall leitet die Gleichbehandlungsstelle das diskriminierende Gesetz bzw. die Vorschrift an den Generalstaatsanwalt weiter, der dann verpflichtet ist, die Rechtsvorschrift zu \u00fcberarbeiten. Dieses Verfahren wird aber nur \u00e4u\u00dferst selten eingehalten, weshalb mehrere diskriminierende Gesetze weiterhin unver\u00e4ndert in Kraft sind. \uf02d Das ungel\u00f6ste \u201eZypernproblem\u201c, d. h. die faktische Teilung des Landes ist eine st\u00e4ndige Quelle ethnischer Diskriminierung, insbesondere seit der \u00d6ffnung der Grenze im Jahr 2003.

Die Ablehnung der Zyperngriechen gegen\u00fcber den in der Verfassung verankerten Quoten f\u00fcr Zypernt\u00fcrken im \u00f6ffentlichen Dienst, der lange ethnische Konflikt und die fortdauernde Anwendung und Ausweitung der \u201eDoktrin der Notwendigkeit\u201c durch Beh\u00f6rden und Gerichte unterwerfen die Gleichbehandlungsthematik der politischen Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit und f\u00fchren zu einer \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen Betonung der staatlichen Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t.

        "28 INTRODUCTION The national legal system The Cypriot Constitution contains a far reaching equality provision which purports to prohibit discrimination on, inter alia, any ground whatsoever. 40 However, this provision has been interpreted restrictively by the Courts as prohibiting differential treatment only where this was deemed \u2018unreasonable\u2019 41 or only where two \u2018equal\u2019 things were being compared. 42 This restrictive approach has led the Court to legitimise differences in retirement ages for employees of different rank or different age and to allow lower awards to disabled athletes compared to non-disabled athletes, introducing a rather wide spectrum of exceptions which go far beyond the exceptions allowed by the two equality directives. In 2015 the tide begun to turn, as the Courts appeared ready to uphold that positive action measures, and in particular, quotas in employment in favour of persons with disabilities, do not violate the equality principle but on the contrary are a necessary step towards achieving equality. 43 However, the elements of \u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable\u2019 differential treatment were still there, giving the courts a much wider margin of discretion than the narrowly defined exceptions found in the Employment Equality Directive. Age discrimination in the national pensions system received considerable attention in 2015, as a number of cases reached the national courts which invariably upheld the position of the national authorities that the Directive permits member states a wide margin of appreciation regarding the measures to be adopted in the field of social policy. 44 The Courts endorsed the position that where two employees have the same date of appointment, it is lawful for seniority to be determined on the basis of the employees\u2019 age. 45 By far the most popular legal channel used by lawyers in Cyprus in order to challenge discrimination is the judicial review process foreseen under article 146 of the Constitution. This process rarely leads to the satisfaction of the applicant victim of discrimination, though, because it does not entitle the Court to look into the merits of the contested decision but merely to assess the legality of the decision-making process; it also has the disadvantage that it cannot be used to challenge discrimination in the private sector, which 40 Cyprus, The Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus ( \u03a4\u03bf \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ), 11 February 1959, Article 28.

        "29 remains an unexplored potential more than 10 years after the non-discrimination directives were transposed. In 1963 the Greek-Cypriot President proposed 13 amendments to the Constitution, which removed the consociational element by limiting the communal rights of the Turkish Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots withdrew from the administration in protest; since then, the administration of the Republic has been carried out by the Greek Cypriots. In the leading case of Ibrahim 1964, 46 the Supreme Court ruled that the functioning of the government must continue on the basis of the \u201cdoctrine of necessity\u201d which effectively suspends the communal rights which the Constitution had granted to the Turkish Cypriot community. A decade later, this doctrine was extended by the Courts to legitimise measures affecting Turkish Cypriots which are of questionable legality. In the years that followed and even until presently, the Courts keep extending this doctrine into new areas, primarily in order to deny Turkish Cypriots access to their properties located in the areas controlled by the Republic 47 but also in order to deny Turkish Cypriots state provisions available to other Cypriot citizens. Until 2006 Turkish Cypriots were also denied the right to vote, based on the doctrine of necessity; however, the Republic was forced to change this law 48 following the ECHR ruling in the case of Aziz v. Cyprus. 49 List of main legislation transposing and implementing the directives The two anti-discrimination directives were transposed on the eve of Cyprus\u2019 accession to the EU, through four different laws: - Disability: The law on persons with disabilities (amendment) N. 57(I)/2004 was adopted on 31 March 2004 and entered into force on 1 May 2004, amending the existing legislation on disability (N. 127(I)/2000). The amending legislation transposed the disability component of the Employment Equality Directive (2000/78/EC) by introducing the directive\u2019s prohibition of discrimination in employment. The law was amended in 2014 (through Law 63(\u0399)/2014) to extend its reasonable accommodation provisions to fields beyond employment and in 2015 (through Law 22(\u0399)/2015) to provide for preferential parking for persons with disability. - Racial and ethnic origin religion or belief, age, sexual orientation: On 31 March 2004 the Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Law No. 58 (1)/2004 was adopted, which came into force on 1 May 2004, in order to transpose the Employment Equality Directive (2000/78/EC) minus the disability component. Its scope covers the field of employment. The law was amended last in 2009 in order to rectify a problem that had arisen regarding the jurisdiction of the labour tribunal to try disputes under this law. - Racial and ethnic origin: On 31 March 2004 the Equal Treatment (Racial or Ethnic Origin) Law No. N. 59 (1)/2004 was adopted, which entered into force on 1 May 2004 in order to transpose the Racial Equality Directive (2000/43/EC) in all the fields foreseen by this directive minus employment, i.e. social protection, medical and 46 Cyprus, Attorney General of the Republic v.

Although the mandate of the Equality Body goes far beyond that foreseen in article 13 in terms of grounds and fields of application, it does not include the provision of independent assistance to victims in pursuing their complaints in Court. More importantly, and as repeatedly highlighted by international monitoring bodies, the limited resources afforded by the state to the Equality Body severely restrict its institutional capacity which has since its inception been inadequately staffed to meet the increasing range of its tasks and increasing volume of work. 50 50 Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Fourth Opinion on Cyprus adopted on 18 March 2015, published 2 November 2015.

        "31 1 GENERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK The Cypriot constitution includes the following articles dealing with non-discrimination: Article 28(1) provides that all persons are equal before the law, the administration and justice and are entitled to equal protection from these and to treatment by these. Article 28(2) guarantees the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by all persons without any discrimination and provides that every person shall enjoy all the rights and liberties foreseen in the Constitution without any direct or indirect discrimination against any person on the grounds of: community; race; religion; language; sex; political or other conviction; national or social descent; birth; colour; wealth; social class; or any ground whatsoever, unless the Constitution itself otherwise provides. Article 6 provides that no law or decision of the House of Representatives or of any of the Communal Chambers (no longer active), and no act or decision of any organ, authority or person exercising executive power or administrative functions, shall discriminate against any of the two \u2018Communities\u2019 or any person by virtue of being a member of a \u2018Community\u2019. 51 By inference, these provisions apply to all areas covered by the directives; their material scope is in fact broader than those of the directives albeit their application is limited as a result of restrictive judicial practices. The constitutional anti-discrimination provision in article 28 is directly applicable and can be enforced against private actors. 52 51 The term \u2018Community\u2019 is used in the Constitution as meaning either the Greek or the Turkish Community of Cyprus. 52 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Yiallourou v.

        "32 2 THE DEFINITION OF DISCRIMINATION 2.1 Grounds of unlawful discrimination explicitly covered The following grounds of discrimination are explicitly prohibited in national law: Article 28 of the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of community; race; religion; language; sex; political or other conviction; national or social descent; birth; colour; wealth; social class; or any ground whatsoever, unless the Constitution itself otherwise provides. The Law on persons with disability N. 127(I)/2000 as amended covers only disability. The Equal Treatment (Racial or Ethnic Origin) Law No. N. 59 (1)/2004 covers racial and ethnic origin. The Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Law No. 58 (1)/2004 covers racial and ethnic origin religion or belief, age and sexual orientation. The Combating or Racial and other Forms of Discrimination (Commissioner) Law N. 42 (1)/2004 which sets out the mandate of the Equality Body, defines this mandate as covering the grounds of race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs, national or ethnic origin, special needs, age and sexual orientation, as well as the rights protected under the Constitution and under the following international conventions ratified by Cyprus: Protocol 12 of the European Convention for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; the Covenant for Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 2.1.1 Definition of the grounds of unlawful discrimination within the directives Disability Disability is defined in the Law on Persons with Disabilities N.127(I)2000 as \u2018any form of deficiency or disadvantage that may cause bodily, mental or psychological limitation permanently or for an indefinite duration which, considering the background and other personal data of the particular person, substantially reduces or excludes the ability of the person to perform one or more activities or functions that are considered normal or substantial for the quality of life of any person of the same age that does not experience the same deficiency or disadvantage\u2019. When comparing the above definition with the concept of disability adopted in Skouboe Werge and Ring, 53 the definition in the Cypriot law falls short of incorporating the juxtaposition of the impairment with the barriers that impede effective participation; instead, the definition of the Cypriot law requires disability to cause permanent or indefinite limitations when juxtaposed with the person\u2019s background and other personal data, but not when juxtaposed with external factors such as structural barriers. This essentially means that the Cypriot definition imposes a more stringent test to be satisfied in order for a disadvantage to be deemed as \u2018disability\u2019 and thus be offered protection under the law. 53 CJEU, Judgment in Joined Cases C-335/11 and C-337/11, Jette Ring and Lone Skouboe Werge , 11 April 2013, available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=136161&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mo de=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=944535. ",
        "33 Also, when comparing the above definition of disability in the Cypriot law to the definition adopted in the Chac\u00f3n Navas 54 case, it emerges that the CJEU focused equally on the source of the limitation (\u2018physical, mental or psychological impairments\u2019) and on the impact (\u2018which hinders the participation of the person concerned in professional life\u2019). The definition in the Cypriot law first describes the characteristics of this condition in a liberal fashion (\u2018deficiency that may cause indefinite or permanent, mental or psychological or bodily limitation\u2019) and then goes on to describe the impact in a rather restrictive mode (substantially reducing or excluding the ability to perform an activity that is \u2018normal\u2019 or substantial for the quality of life). The social insurance law defines disability as \u2018loss of health, strength or the ability to enjoy life\u2019. 55 This should not however be seen as an exhaustive definition of disability but rather to determine eligibility to disability benefit under the particular law. The Law on Public Service which provides for employment opportunities in favour of persons with disabilities in the public sector, defines a \u2018disabled\u2019 person as \u2018a person who congenitally or by a subsequent incident suffers full or limited impairment, and the disability originates from a serious deformation or mutilation of the upper part of the lower limbs, or muscle disease, paraplegia, tetraplegia, or loss of sight in both eyes or loss of hearing in both ears or any other serious condition that substantially reduces a person\u2019s physical condition confining the person to a limited circle of jobs.\u2019 56 This definition follows the restrictive tradition of the Article 2 of Law N.127(I)/2000 and it is arguably more restrictive than the more liberal approach taken by the CJEU in Chac\u00f3n Navas and in Skouboe Werge and Ring. A law which came into force in late 2009 introducing quotas in favour of persons with disability in the public sector defines \u2018person with disability\u2019 as a person who, following an assessment by a multidisciplinary committee, is found to be suffering from a permanent or indefinite insufficiency or disadvantage causing physical, intellectual or mental restrictions in finding and keeping suitable employment. 57 In 2015, when the Supreme Court was asked to review an administrative decision to reject a disabled applicant from inclusion in the catalogue of persons entitled to a quota position in the public service, the court ruled that the appointing body was not justified in disregarding medical opinion which had classified the applicant as a person with disability. The court therefore annulled the administrative act by which the applicant\u2019s request to be included in the quota list had been rejected, thus paving the way for the applicant to submit a fresh application. 58 The Ombudsman\u2019s Annual Report for 2005 59 refers to two cases in which the welfare services discontinued the payment of a benefit to persons with a disability on the ground that the disability could potentially be remedied through an operation and that the disability was not permanent, respectively. In both cases, the Ombudsman found that the complainants\u2019 disabilities did fit the definition of the term as found in the law because the 54 CJEU, Case C-13/05, Sonia Chac\u00f3n Navas v.

        "34 inference that can be drawn from the medical certificates was that the disability in question was of indefinite duration. 60 An Equality Body decision in 2007 61 criticised a scheme of the Ministry of Labour for the provision of care to tetraplegic persons, where tetraplegia was defined as paralysis of the lower limbs resulting from injury to or illness of the bone marrow. The decision found the scheme discriminatory as it treated differently tetraplegic persons whose condition resulted from different reasons and excluded for instance persons whose tetraplegia is due to brain injuries, muscular condition or multiple sclerosis. A 2010 decision of the Equality Body included a speech impediment as falling within the definition of disability as found in the Law on Persons with Disabilities N.127(I)/2000. 62 During 2014 a new law was adopted replacing the welfare grant known as \u2018public benefit\u2019 with the \u2018minimum guaranteed income\u2019. To be eligible for this grant, applicants must meet the law\u2019s definition which, on the one hand, endorses the concept introduced by the CRPD on impairments which hinder equal participation in society when interacting with barriers, but on the other hand renders eligibility conditional upon passing the test of the System of Classification of Disability. 63 This is a new system of assessing disability on the basis of functionality based on an international standard known as \u0399CF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) operated by the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance 64 which has attracted criticism from the disability movement for adopting the medical rather than the social model of addressing disability. Racial/ethnic origin Racial/ethnic origin is only defined in the law ratifying the International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination 65 which incorporates the Convention\u2019s definition. The Convention defines neither race nor ethnic origin but offers a wide definition of racial discrimination as \u201cany distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.\u201d 66 In 2015 the Equality Body issued a report on discrimination against Greek nationals residing in Cyprus. 67 In its legal justification section, the report relied on the Racial Equality Directive. Upon an enquiry sent from the national expert to the Equality Body as to whether the latter considers that the Racial Equality Directive applies to Union nationals residing in Cyprus, the Equality Body responded positively adding that the Equality Directives is based on article 13 of the Treaty on European Union and article 19 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union.

        "35 interpreted as excluding Union citizens from their scope and that Union citizens are primarily granted protection by the two Equality Directives. 68 There are no officially recognised ethnic minorities in Cyprus. The Constitution recognises three \u2018religious groups\u2019, the Armenians, the Maronites and the Latins, and two \u2018communities\u2019, the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots. The Roma are deemed to be part of the Turkish Cypriot community. Modern perceptions of evolving identities conceptualise these groups as having multiple identities: the religious groups are also ethnic groups and national minorities, whilst the Turkish Cypriots are at the same time both a community and a minority in the southern part of Cyprus. Ethnicity is inherent in the identity of five groups who may therefore claim protection under the Racial Equality Directive. The Equality Body has invariably extended protection under the Racial Equality Directive to all of these groups irrespective of their official denomination. In November 2015 the Ministry of Education published a code of conduct for handling racial incidents at schools which provides non-legal definitions for the following terms: identity, diversity, race, prejudice, stereotype, discrimination, racism xenophobia, nationalism, intolerance, homophobia, transphobia, bullying, hate speech, underreporting and racial incident. 69 Identity is defined in the Code as the perception of a person as being part of a specific group with common characteristics; such perception is accompanied by relevant emotional significance attributed to this group and to the group characteristics and includes the perception of a person by others. Possible variations between how a group defines itself and how it is perceived by others may lead to tensions, conflicts or misunderstandings, as identities are multiple and constructed through actions, words, and our political and social life. Diversity is defined in the Code as a product or the result of one\u2019s perception or perspective which differentiates between other persons. The criteria of differentiation may include gender, colour/ appearance, nationality, community or religious group, immigration status, origin, religious or other belief, disability, age, sexual orientation, language, accent, customs, profession, socioeconomic situation, culture, etc. Race is, according to the Code, a manufactured product used to categorise persons on the basis of assumed physical and cultural similarities originating from their common descent. According to the Code, the term \u2018race\u2019 is a construct with no biological or literal status and, scientifically speaking, has no application to the human kind, despite the fact that it is widely used for social action, policy development and justification for differential treatment of groups in relation to other groups. Prejudice is defined as negative predisposition against a group based on arbitrary, incorrect and rigid generalizations and stereotyped beliefs and images as a result of membership of a cultural, ethnic, religious or other group, such as negative attitudes towards Muslims because they supposedly have a tendency to violence and terrorism. Discrimination is defined as unequal treatment or behavior of individuals or groups of people according to their diversity and can be direct or indirect, such as practices or policies that appear \"neutral\" or \"fair\" because they treat everyone equally but have adverse effects on a particular group. Racism is defined in the Code as the process of marginalization, exclusion and discrimination against those considered to be \u2018different\u2019 or \u2018diverse\u2019. Racism does not have 68 Letter from Equality Authority to Corina Demetriou, 12 November 2015, Ref.

        "36 to be intentional and is not static. It can take many different forms, some obvious and direct, such as national denominations, religious or other superiority form or violent attacks against individuals or groups deemed as \"others\", while some are indirect and less obvious, such as institutional racism, the various forms of discrimination imposed by governments, companies or other large essential organizations against non-privileged population groups like minorities and immigrants. Religion/belief Although there is no definition of what \u2018religion\u2019 is for the purposes of the anti- discrimination legislation, Equality Body decisions have established that the term includes atheism. In particular, a 2010 decision of the Equality Body criticised a set of school regulations which provides for exempting students from the religious class only if they are \u2018 not of Christian Orthodox faith\u2019, adding that the regulation forcing students and parents to reveal their religious convictions (in order for the students to be granted exemption from the religious class) is incompatible with the principle of freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 70 Extending this principle further, in 2011 an Equality Body report dealing with religious confessions at schools found that the participation of students in ceremonies forming part of religious convictions creates fertile ground for discrimination, as the non- participation inevitably leads to conclusions as to one\u2019s religious convictions and thus revelation of personal sensitive data, as well as to the labelling and categorization of some students as \u2018good Christians\u2019 and others not. 71 A further intervention of the Equality Body in 2015 on religious freedom at schools criticised the initiative of the Education Ministry to encourage the setting up of teams of children to assist with the religious ceremony in church as a violation of the children\u2019s freedom of religion, challenging the position of the Ministry that the activity was not obligatory and that it was intended to promote volunteerism. The Equality Body questioned whether there can be such a thing as \u2018free consent\u2019 in the context of the school environment and accused the Ministry of clearly favouring one religion over others and restricting religious freedom, which inevitably leads to discrimination against all those who do not belong to it. 72 \u2018Belief\u2019 is a rather neglected ground; it is not defined in the law transposing the Employment Equality Directive nor has it been the subject of any decision either of the court or of the equality body. The new law adopted in 2015 on the political participation of employees in the public sector purports to safeguard the right of such employees to \u2018freely express their political beliefs, political views and convictions\u2019. 73 This however should not be viewed as exhaustive of the definition of \u2018belief\u2019 as found in the law transposing the Employment Equality Directive, particularly in light of the fact that legislation transposing the EU acquis ranks higher than other national laws. Age Although no definition is provided anywhere, Equality Body decisions as well as Court decisions appear to endorse the view that the victim need not be either young or old and that any discrimination on the ground of age is prohibited.

This term does not appear in any piece of legislation other than the law transposing Directive 2000/78/EC. An Equality Body decision in 2005 found that employment advantages granted only to married employees were discriminatory by virtue of Article 28 of the Constitution, as well as by virtue of the law transposing Directive 2000/78/EC on the ground of inter alia sexual orientation, thus extending the definition of this ground to cover potential situations of LGBT persons, whose sexual orientation may be presumed by their decision not to get married. 76 The new law on civil unions does not provide any definitions whatsoever, since it applies equally to all persons who choose to register their relationship in this manner, irrespective of sexual orientation. 77 An Equality Body report in December 2014 78 regarding the CJEU ruling on the procedure of assessment of the credibility of asylum seekers claiming fear of persecution on the ground of their sexual orientation 79 endorsed the CJEU ruling and excluded procedures which infringe upon a person\u2019s privacy and dignity, safeguarded by articles 7 and 1 of the EU Charter respectively. Although the debate at the CJEU concerned asylum, 80 it is reasonable to assume that the same philosophy of respect to one\u2019s privacy should govern discrimination-related claims. 2.1.2 Multiple discrimination In Cyprus prohibition of multiple discrimination is not explicitly included in the law.

        "38 An Equality Body decision in 2008 found that the age restrictions contained in a disability benefit scheme were discriminatory 81 but did not look into the specificities created by the combination of the two grounds. With reference to the same case, in January 2016 the Supreme Court also ruled that the age restriction in the disability scheme amounts to unlawful age discrimination; however, the court also failed to address the case from the perspective of multiple discrimination. 82 There is no law, practice or precedent in Cyprus which takes into consideration the unique situation arising under the intersectionality of grounds. Given the generally low levels of awareness in Cyprus of anti-discrimination provisions, it is not certain at all that additional laws alone would remedy the problem. Extensive awareness raising and training would have to be carried out for policy makers and members of the legal profession to promote understanding of anti-discrimination in general and the specific situation arising when there is more than one ground at play. 2.1.3 Assumed and associated discrimination a) Discrimination by assumption In Cyprus, the laws transposing the equality Directives 83 do not expressly make provision for assumed and associated discrimination. However, the concept of discrimination itself, virtually replicating the directive, defines \u2018direct discrimination\u2019 in the following way: \u201cwhere one person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation\u201d. Assumed or mistaken characteristics may thus be presumed to satisfy the test of discrimination, which is fairly wide. The law on persons with disabilities defines disability as treatment based on characteristics which generally belong to a person with such disability or based on an assumed characteristic which generally belongs to a person with such disability or based on an assumed characteristic generally attributed to a person with such disability. 84 The other two laws transposing the Directives do not contain an equivalent provision; they merely reproduce the wording of the Directives. There has been no case in which this matter was considered by a Cypriot court or by the national Equality Body. b) Discrimination by association In Cyprus, there is no law or case law explicitly prohibiting discrimination based on association with persons with particular characteristics and no judicial interpretation of any related terms or concepts. However: - All three laws transposing the equality directives (N. 58(I)/2004, N. 59(I)/2004 and N. 127(I)/2000 as amended) contain protection against victimisation in line with the 81 Equality Body decision Ref. 114/2007, 10 November 2008. 82 Cyprus, Petros Michaelides v The Republic of Cyprus through the Minister of Labour and Social Insurance, Supreme Court, Review Jurisdiction, Case No. 2005/2012, 27 January 2016, available at http://cylaw.org/cgi- bin/open.pl?file=apofaseis/aad/meros_4/2016/4-201601-2005- 2012.htm&qstring=%E4%E9%E1%EA%F1%E9%F3%2A%20and%202016. 83 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment (racial or ethnic origin) [ \u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0399\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 (\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) N. 59(I)/2004, available at www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2004_1_59/full.html; Cyprus, Law on equal treatment in employment and occupation (\u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u038a\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) 2004 N. 58(I)/2004, available at www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non- ind/2004_1_58/full.html; Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000), available at www.cylaw.org/nomoi/arith/2000_1_127.pdf. 84 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 3.

        "39 said directives. The spirit of the prohibition against victimisation may be extended to cover discrimination by association. - Freedom of association is protected by the Cypriot Constitution (article 21). All constitutional rights are to be enjoyed without discrimination, according to article 28 of the Constitution. - Article 1 (1) of Protocol 12 to the ECHR, which Cyprus has ratified, includes \u2018association with a national minority\u2019 as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Such association may involve various forms, including living with the community and / or otherwise sharing in their misfortunes or being assumed by the perpetrator to be of a particular ethnic minority origin, in line with the ruling of the CJEU in Chez Razpredelenie , which established that the Racial Equality Directive covers \u201cthose who, without possessing that [ethnic] origin, suffer, together with the former, the less favourable treatment or particular disadvantage resulting from that measure\u201d. 85 - The law setting up the Equality Body defines the mandate of the Equality Body as including the promotion of equality in the enjoyment of rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Conventions ratified by Cyprus and referred to explicitly in the law 86 which include Protocol 12, irrespective of race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs, national or ethnic origin. 87 It may then be inferred from this provision that then association becomes a prohibited ground of discrimination at least vis-\u00e0-vis the Equality Body; however the grounds expressly affected by this provision are those related to race/ethnic origin (language, colour, religion etc.) and do not seem to extend to disability, age or sexual orientation. An Equality Body decision in 2010 established that discrimination against the main carer of a person with a disability, in this case the mother of a child with a disability, is unlawful discrimination under the law transposing the Employment Equality Directive (Law N.58(I)/2004), along the lines of the principle established by Coleman v Attridge Law and Steve Law 88 to which this report referred to explicitly. 89 The difference between the case examined by the Equality Body and Coleman v Attridge Law and Steve Law is that the latter case involves direct discrimination whilst in the former case the complainant was refused preferential treatment as regards her job posting. However, the principle was established nevertheless and was reiterated by the Equality Body in the Code of Conduct on disability it issued in September 2010, 90 thus making it harder for the Courts to ignore if and when such a case is presented before them. In 2015 the Equality Body dealt with discrimination by association again, in relation to a woman employee in the public sector who was to be transferred to a post in another city, far away from her brother with psychosocial disability of whom she was the primary carer. 91 The policy of the 85 CJEU, CHEZ Razpredelenie Bulgaria AD v Komisia za zashtita ot diskriminatsia, Case C-83/14, 6 July 2015, paragraph 129.1, Available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=165912&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mo de=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=516528. 86 These Conventions are: Protocol 12 of the European Convention for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; the Covenant for Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 87 Cyprus, The Combating of Racial and Some Other Forms of Discrimination (Commissioner) Law [ O \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ce\u03bd \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (\u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2] No. 42(I)/ 2004, Article 3(1)(b), Part I.

        "40 administration was to transfer employees to different districts on rotation. Whilst the system of transfers provided for consideration of the family circumstances of the employee to be transferred, the term \u2018family\u2019 did not extend beyond spouse and children, as that would, in the opinion of the competent administrative body, infringe upon the principle of proportionality. The administrative body insisted that any exception to this rule would amount to preferential treatment of an employee in relation to others. The Equality Body pointed out that the complainant\u2019s brother was in need of 24-hour supervision and care and had been declared by the court as an \u2018incapable person\u2019; the complainant had been appointed by the court as the person in charge of all his affairs but was also his only close relative in Cyprus and his sole carer, taking care of all his survival needs around the clock. The Equality Body relied on the strengthening of the Employment Equality Directive by the CJEU decision in the Coleman case to establish that the restrictive interpretation given to this legal framework by the administration, by limiting the application of discrimination by association only to spouses and children, was violating the principle established by the CJEU the ruling of which was clearly intended to cover any type of discrimination by association to a person with disability under the care of the complainant. The Equality Body found that any other interpretation of the Directive would truly weaken the scope of protection, pointing out a number of examples of other member states which have extended the principle of discrimination by association to relationships beyond the sphere of the family, covering third persons acting as carers of persons with disabilities. The Equality Body invited the administration to look at the facts of each case separately before deciding on each transfer and to prioritise respect of fundamental rights over other considerations. 2.2 Direct discrimination (Article 2(2)(a)) a) Prohibition and definition of direct discrimination In Cyprus, direct discrimination is prohibited in national law virtually replicating the wording of the directive. 92 The same wording is followed in the Law on Persons with Disability which defines direct discrimination as \u201cunfavourable treatment\u201d when compared to \u201ca person without disability in the same or similar situation\u201d, or on the basis of \u201ccharacteristics which generally belong to persons with such disability\u201d, or \u201calleged characteristics\u201d, or in contravention of a code of practice. 93 b) Justification of direct discrimination Generally speaking, the law does not permit justification of direct discrimination, save for specific situations in relation to the grounds of: 1. Religion in the cases of \u201coccupational activities within churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief\u201d, where \u201cdue to the nature of these activities or framework within which they are exercised, the religion or belief constitutes a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement\u201d, as provided in the Employment Equality Directive. 94 92 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment (racial or ethnic origin) [ \u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0399\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 (\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) N. 59(I)/2004, article 5(1).

        "41 2. Age: this follows the exact wording provided for by Article 6 of the Employment Equality Directive. 95 However, a number of Court decisions interpreting article 28 of the Constitution attempt to establish a norm which essentially deviates from the approach of the two anti- discrimination directives and their CJEU interpretations. The norm emerging from a list of Supreme Court decisions is that equality must be applied only to equal situations and that \u2018different things ... can only be dealt with differently,\u2019 with references to \u2018reasonable discrimination which must be done because of the special nature of things\u2019. 96 Court decisions have additionally introduced the test of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 which essentially provides that discrimination which is \u2018reasonable\u2019 is lawful. 97 This theory is applied by the Courts across the board without taking into consideration the provisions of the directives and often results in allowing discriminatory treatment that is clearly prohibited by the directives. Following this judicial tradition, in 2015 the Supreme Court reiterated the doctrine that the equality principle safeguards against arbitrary differentiations but does not exclude reasonable ones which are allowed as a result of the essential nature of the circumstances. Here, however, the Court also cited the CJEU ruling in the case of Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, to find that any exception to such differential treatment must be narrowly construed as the EU gives emphasis to individual rights recognized by EU law. 98 The judgement marks a departure from previous court rulings on discrimination which had essentially ignored the entire corpus of EU anti- discrimination law and jurisprudence. 2.2.1 Situation testing a) Legal framework In Cyprus the law is silent on situation testing and there is no case law. Below is an analysis derived from the general rules of evidence as developed by case law. The Law on Evidence Cap. 9, which codifies the sources of law, defines the hierarchy of laws for both criminal and civil procedure as follows: the Constitution, the legislation of the Republic since 1960, Common Law and equity and the statutes of U.K. prior to independence. 99 In July 2006 the Constitution was amended to give supremacy to EU Regulations, directives or other binding legal measures enacted by the EU or its bodies. The admissibility of situation testing as a method of proving discrimination in courts will be subjected to the general test of \u2018relevance\u2019 and \u2018the best evidence rule\u2019.

        "42 testing. If situation testing is to be relied upon as a methodology that merely indicates a tendency as to the \u2018general\u2019 or \u2018systematic\u2019 behaviour of the defendant which is based on previous and/ or similar occasions, then the court may treat situation testing as corroborative evidence. The test will be the extent to which this methodology ascertains a probative value as to the behaviour of the defendant. General common law principles are defined in a series of criminal law cases. 100 In common law there is authority that considers the existence of previous and subsequent facts relevant as they may be indicative of certain situations 101 or as an indication of habitual behaviour. 102 It is up to the party who asserts to prove whether the particular behaviour is systematic or mere coincidence or circumstantial , that will determine the relevance to the particular fact at stake. If, however, the situation test is to be relied directly as real evidence of discrimination in action against perpetrators, this is a matter that would require legal argument on the basis of authorities in Europe, U.K. and U.S.A. which would have to prove that the particular test is widely used in Court as direct evidence of discrimination. b) Practice In Cyprus situation testing is not used in practice. Situation testing is an unknown concept in Cyprus and is not used by anyone yet. Most if not all NGOs active in the field of anti-discrimination do not have the resources, human or financial capital, 103 in order to use such methods. The Equality Body was not aware of this concept but its officers stated that they were open to the idea of using situation testing where the circumstances demand or allow. 104 An incident in 2005 which is not precisely situation testing but which carries certain elements of it concerned the refusal of insurance companies to insure drivers of Pontian Greek origin because they considered them to be \u2018high risk\u2019. Two persons of Pontian Greek origin had called up several insurance companies in order to investigate whether they would sell car insurance policies to them. The result was that none of the companies contacted was willing to sell such polices to Pontian Greeks or, if they did, they wanted to charge them with premiums up to two or three times the amount charged to Greek-Cypriots with similar data. They then filed a complaint to the Equality Body which wrote to the insurance companies involved asking them to declare their policies on the matter. It emerged that some of the companies investigated considered persons of Pontian origin to be bad drivers, unreliable and generally \u2018high risk\u2019 and that there was a policy in place to avoid insuring persons of Pontian origin unless \u2018guaranteed\u2019 or \u2018recommended\u2019 by a Greek-Cypriot. In its report issued on 23 June 2005, the Equality Body declared this practice as discriminatory and illegal and recommended that the insurance companies revise their policies warning that it would refrain from imposing penalties at that stage, but that it would not hesitate to impose penalties in the event that the insurance companies do not comply with this recommendation. The process of rectifying this practice did not move further, as the Equality Body did not receive any further complaints about the insurance companies\u2019 policy in this field. 2.3 Indirect discrimination (Article 2(2)(b)) a) Prohibition and definition of indirect discrimination 100 United Kingdom, R.v.

",
        "43 In Cyprus, indirect discrimination is prohibited in national law. 105 For all five grounds except disability, indirect discrimination is defined by replicating the wording of the directives. 106 The disability law incorporates the directives\u2019 definition but also contains an additional provision which, although not termed as a definition, offers elements of what would constitute discrimination, without clarifying whether these are to form an exhaustive description. The wording reads: \u2018a person discriminates against another if he treats that person: (a) in a more unfavourable way than what he treats or would treat other persons without disability in the same or in a similar situation; (b) on the basis of characteristics generally belonging to person with such disability or based on a presumed characteristic which generally belongs to a person with such disability or based on a presumed characteristic which is generally attributed to a person with disability; or (c) based on the fact that this person does not satisfy or is not in a position to satisfy a condition, the nature of which is such that a high percentage of persons who do not have such disability satisfy or are in a position to satisfy, when compared to persons who do have such disability and the existence of such a condition is not justified by the circumstances of the case. 107 This provision appears to be narrower than the directive\u2019s requirement which extends to any \u201capparently neutral provision, criterion or practice [that] would put persons having a particular [disability]\u201d at a disadvantage, but since the directive\u2019s definition is also incorporated no issue of compliance with the directive arises. b) Justification test for indirect discrimination Although this issue was not directly dealt with by the Courts so far, we may nevertheless assume, on the basis of Cypriot case law on gender discrimination, of European court decisions, as well as from persuasive authority of UK court decisions, that the \u2018but for test\u2019 is likely to apply. The test involves asking the question as to how the victim would be treated had s/he not had the special characteristic, such as the particular ethnic origin or disability or religion or age or sexual orientation that s/he had. There is no judicial precedent on what test must be used in order for employers to justify a requirement, criterion or practice which results in discrimination. The case law on the subject is not particularly enlightening. A Supreme Court decision in 2008, where the claimant contested his obligatory retirement at 55 based on his low rank, failed to consider either the aim or the legitimacy of the contested provision or whether the means were appropriate or necessary; instead, the Court\u2019s decision was premised upon the rather odd theory that the applicant failed to prove that the differential treatment was not based on reasonable discrimination. 108 In other cases, the Courts allowed exceptions to the non- discrimination principle which are wider than those foreseen in directive, such as \u2018unequal\u2019 situations which must be treated \u2018unequally\u2019, without offering any definitions of the terms found in the laws transposing the two Anti-discrimination directives. Judicial practice may evolve, however, following a more recent Supreme Court decision of January 2016 where the justification of the poor state of public finances, offered by the authorities in support 105 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment (racial or ethnic origin) [ \u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0399\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 (\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) N. 59(I)/2004, article 5.

        "44 of an age criterion in a disability scheme, was rejected by the court as failing to meet the test of reasonableness, proportionality and objectivity. 109 By contrast, the Equality Body has issued a number of reports pursuant to complaints on age discrimination, where the tendency is to uphold the general principle of equality and to approach the issue from a fundamental rights perspective. The Equality Body\u2019s decisions show a good understanding and articulation of the concepts of legitimate aim and appropriate means as well as of decisions and debates at the EU level. Following below are examples of how the Equality Body has over the years assessed the allegations of employers as to what amounts to \u2018legitimate aim\u2019 and how the \u201cappropriate and necessary measure\u201d is interpreted: - The conditions for the promotion of police officers contained an age limit of 40 years as a prerequisite for appointment in the specialized position. The Equality Body found that, although the aim of seeking to secure the operational readiness of the police force was legitimate, the means used to attain it were neither appropriate nor necessary. 110 - The age limit of 60 for school traffic wardens was found by the Equality Body to be based on a legitimate aim (the safety of the school children) but the choice of the age limit as a measure for achieving this aim was neither appropriate nor necessary, because age is not necessarily the ideal criterion for assessing one\u2019s physical condition. 111 - The age limit of 40 set as a condition of eligibility in a scheme of financial support for artificial insemination, was found by the Equality Body to be discriminatory, based on the reasoning that the exclusive use of the age criterion is not the most appropriate means for achieving the legitimate aim of supporting under-fertile couples. 112 - A legislative provision in the Pensions Law which provides for a less favourable retirement package for public servants under 45 who choose to take early retirement, was found by the Equality Body to be disproportionate, as it covers 2/3 of the public service workforce; the aim served was not legitimate because the shortages in scientific personnel invoked have since been covered. 113 The issue was the subject of a Court decision in 2014 114 and of infringement proceedings initiated by the Commission against the Cypriot government which resulted in a ruling against Cyprus. 115 - The Equality Body found the policy of insurance companies not to insure persons over 70 to drive cars or if they do insure them to charge a higher premium, unjustified and unsupported by reliable statistical evidence to prove that persons over 70 have more accidents than younger persons. 116 - A legislative provision allowing the dismissal without compensation of employees who have reached retirement age was found to be discriminatory.

        "45 the Ministry of Labour that this measure was justified because employees aged 65 plus are secured through their pension and provident fund benefits was rejected. 117 c) Comparison in relation to age discrimination National law does not specify how a comparison is to be made in relation to age discrimination. Apart from the labour tribunal decision in the case of Hadjiavraam , 118 there is no other source of interpretation of how the comparison is to be made. In this case the court found that there was no real person in the selection procedure that could be compared with the applicant; thus the only comparator is a hypothetical candidate with the same qualifications as the applicant but aged under 26 years, which was the maximum age set in the job advertisement forming the subject matter of the lawsuit. One of the very first Equality Body decisions from 2004 may also be relevant in interpreting this provision. In a decision relating to the fixing of a maximum age in a public service post, the test used by the Equality Body in order to determine whether age discrimination existed or not was whether the nature of the job justified the fixing of a maximum age limit and whether similar positions in other contexts (i.e. of equivalent seniority, in similar fields etc.) carry an age limit. The case concerned the age limit of 60 fixed in respect of the appointment of members of the Commission on Educational Service and the test applied was whether the functions performed by the public service committee (where no age limit applies) are substantially different to those of the education committee. As the answer to this question was negative, the report concluded that there was no reasonable justification in permitting an age limit for the latter. 119 Similarly, a decision pursuant to a complaint for age discrimination in the fixing of age limit for the position of temporary postal distributor at the public post office, found the age limit unjustified, inter alia, because the post of permanent postal distributor does not carry any age limit. 120 2.3.1 Statistical evidence a) Legal framework In Cyprus there are national rules restricting data collection. There is a general rule prohibiting the collection of data that derives from article 8 of the ECHR and is also contained in article 15 of Constitution, unless specifically provided under certain circumstances. Data protection laws prohibit the collection and processing of sensitive personal data and list the circumstances under which this is exceptionally allowed. 121 Three of these are relevant to this context: (a) Processing is necessary for the satisfaction of lawful interest which is superior to the rights and fundamental freedoms of the subject of the data; 122 (b) Processing concerns exclusively data that the subject of it has published or is necessary for the recognition or the exercise of a right before a court; 123 117 Cyprus, Equality Authority, Report No. A.K.I. 13/2005, 11 April 2007. 118 Cyprus, Labour Court, Avgoustina Hadjiavraam v.

        "46 (c) Processing concerns exclusively statistical, research, scientific or historical reasons, subject to ensuring that measures are taken to protect the subjects of the data. Although most of the grounds covered by the anti-discrimination directives are classified in the data protection law as constituting sensitive data and at points this law covers grounds beyond those of the anti-discrimination directives, age is missing from the protected characteristics. \u2018Sensitive data\u2019 is defined in the law as data concerning racial or national 124 origin, political belief, religious or philosophical conviction, participation in an organisation, association or trade union, health (which is much wider in scope than \u2018disability\u2019), sex-life and sexual orientation, criminal prosecution or criminal conviction. 125 \u201cPersonal data\u201d is defined in the law as any information referring to the subject of data, i.e. a physical person, who is still in life. Aggregate data of a statistical nature, from which the subjects of the data can no longer be detected, are not considered as \u2018personal data\u2019. Under article 6(3) of Law 138(I)/2001, the Council of Ministers may issue regulations following a proposal by the Personal Data Protection Commissioner, on the processing of data in cases other than the ones provided for under the law when there are serious reasons of public interest involved. In response to an enquiry which the author made to the Cypriot Commissioner for the Protection of Personal Data, the Commissioner informed that: \u2018The collection and keeping by employers of data of their employees in respect of their ethnic or racial origin, disability, religion or belief or sexual orientation (sensitive data) as a rule is prohibited. It is permitted if this is necessary so that the employer fulfils his/her obligations in the field of employment law and s/he obtains a license for this purpose from the Personal Data Commissioner (Article 6(1) (2) (a) of the Law on processing of Personal Data)\u2019. 126 One may conclude that the employee\u2019s written authorisation is not necessary in the aforesaid cases. Presumably the same principle would apply outside the employment field. Based on the Commissioner\u2019s statement as aforesaid, one may safely assume that the law will be interpreted and applied by the courts in a way compatible with the Data Commissioner\u2019s interpretation. In order to apply the regulation concerning access to the labour market by various categories of workers, the Labour Office of the Ministry of Labour maintains records concerning country of origin, ethnic origin and whether they are asylum seekers or not. In the non-employment field, data on ethnic origin is kept at the national level for various purposes. For instance, the population censuses carried out by the Statistical Service of the Republic keeps figures on each of the ethnic and religious communities of Cyprus (Greek-Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Maronites, Armenians and Latins) as well as on the names and countries of origin of third country nationals. The research conducted by the Statistical Service of the Republic for the purposes of the 2011 population census did collect information from the interviewees as regards their religion but this was neither processed nor published due to recent trends in regarding religion as personal sensitive data. 127 The Roma are not classified separately nor identified as such by the educational system, as 124 The reference to \u2018national\u2019 origin, as opposed to \u2018ethnic\u2019 origin, may well be a reflection of the fact that in Greek the two terms have a similar sound and many people tend to use them interchangeably, as the distinction between the two may not be widely known in Cyprus. From the context, one may perhaps conclude that \u2018ethnic\u2019 would have been a better word, since personal data on national origin are widely used and processed. 125 Cyprus, The Processing of Personal Data (Protection of the Individual) Law [O \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0395\u03c0\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0394\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1 (\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) ] \u039d. 138(\u0399)/2001, Article 2.

Although the processing of personal data without permission was prohibited as of 2001, the notion that in a multicultural society religion is a personal matter was not widely embedded in social culture. Contrary to the policy adopted as regards the 2011 population census, the population census of 2001 did publish data on religion. ",
        "47 they are considered to be part of the Turkish Cypriot community. Constitutionally, the Roma do in fact form part of the Turkish-Cypriot community, since by virtue of the Constitution they could only belong to one or the other community; however, the same applies to the Maronites, the Latins and the Armenians, who are constitutionally part of the Greek-Cypriot community, and they are nevertheless afforded a separate classification from the state\u2019s Statistical Service. 128 The Ministry of Education also maintains data on school children according to their ethnic (as well as their national) origin; again the Roma are not classified separately but are integrated into the figure for Turkish-Cypriots. In some tables supplied by the Ministry, a group of pupils are classified as \u2018Turkish-speaking\u201d; this term would include primarily Turkish-Cypriots but to some extent also Roma and Kurdish pupils. The records which are publicly accessible do not show names of individuals, only numbers per ethnic origin. In some cases, particularly relating to positive measures in education there is evidence suggesting that statistical data is used in order to design positive action measures. For instance, in order for the Ministry of Education to place a school within the \u201cEducational Priority Zone\u201d, an investigation is carried out into poverty levels in the area, concentration of non-native Greek speakers, dropout rates etc. 129 Similarly, data is kept on the native language (i.e. ethnic origin) of the members of the school population in order to determine where and to what extent Greek language classes must be introduced in an effort to foster inclusion and the cohesion of the classroom. Also, in order to decide whether to open a Turkish speaking school, in compliance with the request of the UN Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), the government carried out a survey amongst the Turkish speaking families of the area concerned in order to establish whether they wanted to send their children to such a school. The survey showed that the parents preferred to send their children to the mainstream Greek school, and thus the government decided not to set up a Turkish school. 130 In the confrontation between the Ministry of Education and Maronite community regarding the Ministry\u2019s failure to raise the subsidies for school fees of Maronite students attending private schools, statistical evidence was used by the representative of the Maronite community in order to prove that only a small percentage of the Maronite students enrolled at the minority schools for which subsidies were offered. In 2010, this confrontation led to an Equality Body recommendation to the authorities that the claim of the minorities for increasing the school fees subsidy for the private secular schools should be favourably considered. 131 Generally speaking, however, Cypriot authorities do not systematically collect data and when they do they do not use them for policy development. In the case of racial incidents at schools, and despite criticisms repeatedly directed against the Ministry by national and international monitoring bodies 132 for failing to record these incidents, the Ministry has set up a system of handling racial incidents at schools without 128 Upon the establishment of the Republic, all religious groups were asked to choose as to whether they wanted to \u201cbelong\u201d to the Greek Cypriot community or the Turkish Cypriot community. They opted to belong to the former. The Roma were not asked to choose; they were simply assumed to belong to the Turkish Cypriot community because of their common religion (Muslim) and language. 129 This measure, which has been in place for some years now, aims at placing in a special category certain schools where special attention and particular measures are needed to address certain educational needs, such as pupils coming from particularly poverty-stricken areas, high concentration of non-native Greek speakers, high dropout rate etc. Schools classified as falling within ZEP receive extra teaching hours and other measures where needed. The institution of ZEP aims at reducing inequalities for pupils attending schools in disadvantaged areas with an increased proportion of immigrants, combating school failure and illiteracy. 130 A survey carried out by UNFICYP into the same matter produced the opposite result, i.e. that the parents did want their children to attend a Turkish school. Also the results of the governmental survey were disputed by the Union of Turkish Cypriot teachers K.T.O.S. who subsequently proceeded to sue the government in Court for violating the right of Turkish Cypriot children to education. 131 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report No. A.K.R. 114/2005, 08 November 2010. 132 See for instance: Council of Europe, ECRI Report on Cyprus, Fourth monitoring cycle, 31 May 2011, available at http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country/Cyprus/CYP-CbC-IV-2011-020- ENG.pdf; Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Fourth Opinion on Cyprus adopted on 18 March 2015, published 2 November 2015, available at http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680483b 48.

        "48 publishing any statistics about the incidents 133 even though this system requires teachers to regularly submit to the ministry data about racial incidents at their schools. Similarly, an Observatory for School Violence set up in 2009 is yet to publish statistics about the incidents recorded. 134 There have been no new policies relying on knowledge derived from the data collected. In 2010 an Equality Body report criticised the procedure for exemption of pupils from the religious class at schools, and particularly the fact that the pupils\u2019 parents are asked to declare their religion, pointing out that a person\u2019s religion constitutes sensitive personal data that need not be revealed unless there is objective and reasonable justification serving a legitimate aim. The report recommended that students be exempted from the religious class without having to reveal their religious beliefs and for reasons of conscience and that a special form should be introduced for parents to complete when requesting exemption from the religious class expressly stating that there is no obligation to reveal one\u2019s religion. 135 The issue remained open by the end of 2015, as the Ministry failed to comply with the Equality Body\u2019s requirements, which promoted the latter to revert with another report, warning the Ministry of its intention to issue a binding decision against it. 136 In 2010 the Ombudsman 137 issued a report pursuant to a complaint submitted a month earlier by a lawyer on behalf of a migrant woman who was an HIV carrier and had been detained for the purposes of deportation, after her asylum application had been rejected. 138 The guards at the detention centre informed all other inmates that she was suffering from HIV/AIDS and should therefore be using a separate washroom. The Ombudsman\u2019s report concluded that sensitive data concerning the complainant\u2019s health were revealed to third parties unlawfully and without her consent. The fears expressed by the members of staff that the non-revelation of the complainant\u2019s condition would have endangered the health of other persons using the same space were not seen as valid, since the medical certificate which the complainant was issued by the state hospital and which had been notified to the management of the detention centre expressly stated that the complainant did not suffer from any contagious disease endangering public health. Similarly, in 2011 an Ombudsman\u2019s report 139 on access to the labour market by HIV carriers revealed that the low response of HIV persons to a special scheme for employment in the public sector ten years after its introduction was largely attributed to the fact that the procedure foreseen in the scheme involved the registration of prospective applicants with the Labour Office declaring that they are HIV positive, a fact which is in turn communicated to the Minister of Labour for further communication to the Ministry involved and to the Head of Department where the applicant is applying for employment. The Ombudsman noted that the declaration of the applicant\u2019s health condition to a number of persons every time s/he applies for a job position may deter an applicant from taking advantage of the said scheme but may also be a reason for rejection of a job application, urging the authorities to remove this obstacle from the procedure. 140 In the field of disability, where positive measures often take the form of grants, there is little evidence of the use of statistical data in order to design positive measures.

        "49 measure introduced during 2010, involving the covering of the costs for escorts for persons with disability was designed after the disability organisations submitted, upon the request of the Ministry of Labour, details on the numbers amongst their members that would make use of such service. The funding granted was commensurate with the numbers of persons with disabilities that would be benefiting from the services of the escorts. Other measures in the disability field which do not involve the granting of monetary benefits, such as the preferential parking provided in the disability law, 141 appear to be the result of pressure from the disability movement rather than the result of the use of statistical data. b) Practice In Cyprus statistical evidence in order to establish indirect discrimination is not widely used in practice. Court practice does not generally involve argumentation on ethical or methodological issues, although litigants may use statistical evidence to support their line of argument. The Equality Body does use statistical data occasionally to demonstrate the depth or intensity of a problem. Once such case concerned discrimination against female migrant domestic workers whose right to join a trade union was restricted by the standard employment contract they were forced to sign. 142 In the reasoning of this decision, the Equality Body also made reference to the low salaries paid to migrant domestic helpers 143 compared to Cypriot workers, pointing out that the number of migrant female domestic workers now in Cyprus is about 18,000. 144 The data was used in this report in order to highlight the acuteness of the problem, based on the large size of this group and on the disparity in the salaries of migrants and locals, rather than to determine whether an act is or is not discriminatory. During 2010 the Equality Body commissioned a survey into the vocational training needs of the female migrant domestic workers which rendered a series of interesting results on the profile of this highly vulnerable group. Although the purpose of choosing to focus on vocational training needs is not clear, the interest of the Equality Body in the use of statistical data is obvious. Opinion surveys were also commissioned by the Equality Body in previous years, mainly in order to assess public opinion towards various vulnerable groups (LGBT persons, Pontian-Greeks, persons with disability) although the results were used more for awareness raising rather than for reaching a legal decision. In 2008 the Equality Body examined an age discrimination complaint against several insurance companies whose policy was to refuse to insure persons over 70 to drive cars or to charge them higher premiums. The Equality Body\u2019s decision found that the practice or policy complained of, unsupported by reliable statistical evidence , is not reasonably and objectively justified and therefore amounts to discrimination. 145 It follows that had statistical evidence shown that persons over 70 are indeed more accident prone, then the difference in treatment would have been justified and therefore not discriminatory. Thus the Equality Body appears to have been prepared to accept statistical evidence in order to decide whether discrimination had taken place or not. There is no evidence suggesting that the Courts are reluctant to allow the use of statistical data as evidence. There have been cases where statistical evidence was introduced and 141 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 7A.

There is no case law on the use of statistical evidence in the anti-discrimination field, although there is case law on the use of statistical evidence in other areas of the law: In Kaskavallis 146 the Supreme Court rejected an appeal against a decision of the Licensing Authority by which the appellant\u2019s application for a taxi license was turned down based, inter alia, on statistics of the Cyprus Tourism Organisation about tourist arrivals for the period in question. The decision impliedly accepted the use of statistics by the Licensing Authority in order to decide on the appellant\u2019s application for a taxi license. 2.4 Harassment (Article 2(3)) a) Prohibition and definition of harassment In Cyprus, harassment is prohibited in national law. 147 It is defined in a variety of legislative instruments which are set out below. As a concept, harassment was first introduced into Cyprus law in 2002 with Law N. 205(I)/2002 on the Equal Treatment of Men and Women in Employment and Vocational Training that came into force on 1 st January 2003. This law introduced \u201charassment based on sex\u201d as part of the definition of \u201csexual harassment\u201d. Later, in amending Law N. 40(I)/2006, the two terms were defined separately. In the legislation transposing the equality directives, harassment is defined as \u201cunwanted conduct related to any of the [recognised] \u2026 grounds \u2026 with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment\u201d. 148 The Criminal Code 149 provides for a number of offences that relate to harassment and may potentially be used to prosecute discrimination falling under the scope of the directives: - Article 138 prohibits damage to a place of worship or to an object held sacred by any class of persons with the intention of insulting the religion of any class of persons; - Article 139 prohibits the disturbing of religious assemblies; - Article 140 prohibits trespassing on burial places with the intention of insulting the religion of any person; - Article 141 prohibits the uttering of words, the making of any sound or any gesture with the intent of wounding the religious feelings of any person; - Article 142 prohibits publications insulting any religion; - Article 51A prohibits public incitement to violence amongst residents and the cultivation of a spirit of intolerance; - Article 47(1)(b) prohibits action taken publicly with the intention of promoting 146 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Andreas Kaskavalis v.

At the level of international and EU law, a number of legislative instruments transposed or ratified by Cyprus contain provisions that may be used to prosecute harassment. In 1992 a law was introduced amending the Law ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination of 1967, rendering certain public statements a criminal offence, which bear similarity to the above definition of harassment. The law provides that any person who publicly, either orally or in writing through written text, imaging or in any other way, intentionally incites acts which may cause discrimination, hatred or violence against persons or groups of persons for the sole reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion, is guilty of a criminal offence. 150 In addition, the following laws contain provisions that may be used to prosecute acts that may be termed as harassment: - the Law on the Combating of Certain Forms and Expressions and Racism and Xenophobia through Criminal Law N. 134(I)/2011, 151 which purports to transpose the corresponding Framework Decision; 152 - the Law Ratifying the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime concerning the Criminalisation of Acts of Racist or Xenophobic Nature committed through Computer Systems, N.26(III)/2004; and - The Law ratifying the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide N. 59/1980. No case has been adjudicated in Court so far under any of the above provisions. In Cyprus harassment does explicitly constitute a form of discrimination. 153 b) Scope of liability for harassment Where harassment is perpetrated by an employee, in Cyprus the employer is liable. Under article 13 of the Law on Civil Offences (Cap 148) 154 a \u2018master\u2019 is responsible for the actions or omissions of his \u2018servant\u2019 for acts authorised or approved by the former or for acts carried out by the servant in the course of his work. The terms \u2018master\u2019 and \u2018servant\u2019 used in the text of the law mean employer and employee respectively. The master is not responsible for the actions of persons to whom the servant has assigned work without the authorisation of the employer.

None of these provisions affect the servant\u2019s liability for any acts committed by him. 2.5 Instructions to discriminate (Article 2(4)) a) Prohibition of instructions to discriminate In Cyprus, instructions to discriminate are prohibited in national law. 155 Instructions are not defined. In Cyprus instructions explicitly constitute a form of discrimination. b) Scope of liability for instructions to discriminate In Cyprus the instructor is liable. Although the laws transposing the directives are silent on the employers\u2019 liability as regards the actions of their employees, under the general principles of labour law employers are vicariously liable for the actions of their employees. An employee who has discriminated because s/he has received an instruction to discriminate is not explicitly covered by the laws transposing the directives, however it is likely that such employee will be held liable for direct or indirect discrimination, irrespective of whether the motive was to follow the employer\u2019s instructions, depending on the circumstances and on what choices the employee had. The dismissal of an employee because s/he refuses to carry out an unlawful instruction, such as an instruction to discriminate, is unlawful and gives rise to compensation. 2.6 Reasonable accommodation duties (Article 2(2) (b) (ii) and Article 5 Directive 2000/78) a) Implementation of the duty to provide reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities in the area of employment In Cyprus, the duty to provide reasonable accommodation is included in the law. It is defined. Prior to the transposition of the Employment Framework Directive, the disability law provided for the duty to adopt \u201creasonable measures\u201d to the extent and where the local economic and other circumstances allow. 156 These measures are not restricted to the working place but cover: (a) basic rights (right to independent living, diagnosis and prevention of disability, personal support with assistive equipment, services etc., accessibility to housing, buildings, streets, the environment, public means of transport, etc., education, information and communication through special means, services for social and economic integration, vocational training, employment in the open market, etc.); 157 (b). employment including access to, working conditions, training etc.; 158 (c). supply of goods and services, including the facilitation of accessibility for safe and comfortable use 155 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 2.

Thus, an amendment to the disability law in 2007 added a new article which provides that, in order for the principle of equal treatment of persons with disabilities to be implemented, the employer must take reasonable measures depending on the needs arising in any particular case, so that a person with a disability has access to an employment post, to carry out his/her profession or to be promoted, or to undergo training, so long as these measures do not lead to disproportionate burden for the employer. 164 b) Practice A burden is not disproportionate when it is sufficiently balanced by measures taken in the framework of state policy in favour of persons with disability. 165 The 2014 amendment to the disability law essentially extends the right to reasonable accommodation to a number of areas beyond employment, provided the burden is not disproportionate or unjustified, abandoning the old approach which rendered the right to reasonable accommodation beyond employment subject to \u201cwhere the local economic conditions allow\u201d and \u201csubject to public finances\u201d, both of which are currently in a pretty bad state. However, the amendment falls short of creating a mandatory regime as the defence of the disproportionate burden is likely to be successfully invoked by service providers or merchants in court in order to avoid any kind of expenditure, in light of the economic crisis. Over the years, the Equality Body has interpreted the duty to provide reasonable accommodation as follows: - A 2006 decision regarding accommodation for dyslectic pupils in school exams found that the Ministry of Education wrongly viewed the credibility and prestige of the exam and the need to avoid giving the dyslectic pupil an unfair advantage as priority 159 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 6.

        "54 considerations and recommended that dyslectic students be given additional accommodation to the mere extra time of 30 minutes at the exam. 166 In another decision on a similar complaint, the Equality Body found that the principle of reasonable accommodation is founded upon the premise that the measure must be such so as to ensure equality in opportunity and not in the result. 167 - The policy of the Ministry of Education to transfer public education teachers based solely on the needs of the service without reference to the existence or not of any disability, and disregarding the complainant\u2019s need to work in a stable and safe environment amounts to indirect discrimination on the ground of disability. 168 - The revocation by the employer of the right initially granted to an employee with multiple sclerosis to take two afternoons off in order to undergo physiotherapy was found to be discriminatory. Citing a landmark ECtHR ruling, 169 the decision stressed that the treatment of persons without a disability in relation to persons with a disability cannot be the same, if equality is to be attained. 170 - In 2009, a complaint was submitted to the Equality Body by a job applicant who had achondroplasia, whose job application was rejected as a result of her height. The Equality Body concluded that the employer had an obligation to place files in shelves which would be accessible by the complainant and/or provide a ladder to enable her to reach files in high shelves. 171 - The reduction in teaching hours can constitute reasonable accommodation, provided the symptoms of the disability render teaching painful or exhausting. 172 The Code of Conduct on disability discrimination at the workplace issued by the Equality Body in September 2010 provides that the duty to provide reasonable accommodation is premised upon the principle that the measure must ensure equality in opportunity and not in the result, therefore the measure must be such so as to offer the person with disability the same opportunity as all other persons, e.g. persons with arthritis applying for the position of a typist must be given a special keyboard in order to be able to compete with the other applicants on the typing speed. Also persons with a disability who take exam for the purposes of a selection procedure for a job must be given such facilities so as to enable them to compete with the non-disabled candidates on equal terms. The employer\u2019s obligation to provide reasonable accommodation affects regulations or criteria set by the employer as well as the way in which the workplace is organized (e.g. offering a wheelchair user the chance to work on the ground floor of a building where this is available). The Code offers a non-exhaustive list of guidelines on reasonable accommodation measures: changes or adaptations to the building infrastructure (ramps and toilets for wheelchair users, Braille language on the buttons in the elevators etc.); re-allocation of duties amongst employees so as to allocate to employees with disabilities duties they can perform; transfer to another job position if available; sick leave for the purposes of therapy; vocational training including training related to a person\u2019s disability e.g. use of new technologies or new equipment or logistics that can upgrade a disabled person\u2019s skills; facilitating the participation in trade unions; the upgrading of existing equipment; other forms of support or assistance. 173 The law setting out the mandate of the Equality Body 166 Cyprus, Equality Authority, File No. AKI 24/2006, AKI 27/2006, 31 October 2006. 167 Cyprus, Equality Authority, Report No. A.K.I. 37/2008, 8 October 2008. 168 Cyprus, Equality Authority, File No. 9/2007, 12 September 2007. 169 Thlimmenos v.

        "55 foresees the issue of Codes of Conduct by the Equality Body which can impose specific duties on persons in the public or private sector. 174 However, such codes must be appended to regulations issued with the approval of the Council of Ministers; this procedure was not followed in the case of the Code of Practice on Disability Discrimination and in essence this code has the character of a clarification document rather than a binding set of rules. The Court may refer to the Code and derive guidance from the examples contained in it, but it is not legally bound to do so and in fact the Code has never been referred to in Court or in any official documents. In 2015 the Equality Body issued a report against the state TV company Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) because the lack of accessibility features in their building, which dates back to the 1950s, had prevented an employee who was a wheelchair user from carrying out his work. The employee, who became tetraplegic following an accident, was asked to work in a different department than before performing different tasks. In his new position, the rooms were more accessible than in his previous post but even there he was unable to perform the tasks assigned to him because in order to supervise the flow of TV programs he needed access to two other rooms which he didn\u2019t have because those rooms were not accessible to wheelchair users. He was forced into resignation and filed a discrimination complaint against CyBC. The Equality Body found that the delay of CyBC to respond to their obligation as employers to provide reasonable accommodation amounted to direct discrimination and advised CyBC to proceed to all necessary structural modifications to make their building accessible. 175 c) Definition of disability and non-discrimination protection The definition of disability applicable does not differ when claiming reasonable accommodation from when claiming general protection from discrimination. d) Duties to provide reasonable accommodation in areas other than employment for people with disabilities In Cyprus, there is a duty to provide reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities outside the employment field. 176 The definition of disproportionate burden in fields beyond employment does not differ from that used in the context of employment. e) Failure to meet the duty of reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities In Cyprus failure to meet the duty of reasonable accommodation may be interpreted as amounting to discrimination. Although the law does not expressly provide that failure to meet the duty of reasonable accommodation amounts to discrimination, this may be inferred from the wording of the law, which stipulates that, in order to comply with the principle of equal treatment , reasonable accommodation is foreseen and for this purpose the employer must take all necessary measures so as the person with disability may have access to a job position, may exercise his profession or may attend training, provided the burden is not \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 ).

        "56 unreasonable. 177 No case has ever been adjudicated in Court on this point but this interpretation is invariably followed by the equality body. 178 If one adopts the interpretation that breach of the duty to provide reasonable accommodation amounts to discrimination, it follows that breach of such duty leads to the sanctions foreseen in the law for discrimination. 179 In the case of both discrimination and breach of the duty to provide reasonable accommodation, the sanctions are imposed where the perpetrator has acted without reasonable cause. 180 The Code of Conduct on disability discrimination at the workplace issued by the Equality Body in 2010 explicitly provides that the employer\u2019s failure to adopt reasonable accommodation measures amounts to unlawful discrimination and is punishable with a fine of up to CY\u00a3 4,000 (=\u20ac 6,834) or imprisonment of up to six months, as in all other forms of discrimination. 181 There is no explicit provision in the law for the reversal of the burden of proof in cases where there was a breach of the duty to provide reasonable accommodation. However, if one adopts the view that breach of this duty amounts to discrimination, then the reversal of the burden of proof foreseen in the law for discrimination cases 182 applies. It should be noted that the burden of proof is reversed only in employment related cases and not in fields beyond employment. No case was ever tried by the Courts on reasonable accommodation. However, the decisions of the Equality Body on this issue consider the failure to meet this duty as discrimination prohibited by law, even before the 2007 change of the law, which rendered the duty to provide reasonable accommodation as a binding obligation on the employer. Thus, a complaint from a blind person working as a telephonist in the hospital, who was moved to a new hospital and had to cope with a more complicated telephone system, with more telephone lines and with a less favourable working schedule was found by the Equality Body to be well founded. The Equality Body decided that the hospital authorities ought to have transferred to the new post one of the other employees without a disability and to leave the blind employee at the post where he was familiar with the system. The report called on the hospital authorities to explain, in a manner satisfactory to the Equality Body, why the employee had to be moved to the new hospital, failing which a decision would be issued against them by the Equality Body. 183 An Equality Body report published in 2012 regarding the adequacy of school units for autistic children concluded that the provision of education and training to children with disabilities, under circumstances where the school infrastructure is so lacking that their special needs are not met, amounts to a violation of the principle of equality, since the children are prevented from equal opportunity to develop their personality and skills. 184 177 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 5(1A).

        "57 A 2009 decision of the Equality Body on a complaint from the representative of the Maronite community regarding the inadequate arrangements at the Maronite school, found that special treatment involves deviations from the principle of equality, which take the form of positive measures or special rights targeting a certain group aiming at the elimination of discrimination. The decision criticised the line of argumentation of the Ministry of Education which offered the Maronite community only equal treatment before the law, adding that the protection of national minorities must go beyond that, to recognise and promote rights of a collective character. 185 f) Duties to provide reasonable accommodation in respect of other grounds In Cyprus there is no duty to provide reasonable accommodation in respect of other grounds in either the public or the private sector. Nevertheless, the Equality Body recognises such a right in respect of religion or at least recommends to the relevant authorities to respect religious freedom for students and for prisoners by providing reasonable accommodation to them to practice their faith. This approach of the Equality Body is premised more on the conviction that religion is a sensitive issue rather than an interpretation of the law as granting such a right. In December 2005 following a complaint on behalf of a Jehovah\u2019s Witness pupil against the behaviour of the religious instruction teacher towards her, the Equality Body criticized the practice of restricting pupils exempted from the religious lesson into the library and recommended that more creative occupation be sought for the exempted pupils. 186 In 2010 another Equality Body report criticised the procedure for exemption of pupils from the religious class and for the fact that the handling of the exemption request by the school led to the stigmatisation of the student-complainant, as she was for several months isolated from her classmates. 187 In its reports, the Equality Body does not cite the anti- discrimination laws, which clearly do not impose a duty to provide reasonable accommodation on the ground of religion, but article 18 from the Cypriot Constitution which provides that all religions are equal before the law; 188 Article 14 of the International Convention for the rights of Child; and Article 9 of the ECHR. 189 The situation escalated in 2012, when a circular from the Ministry of Education required pupils exempted from the religious class to remain in the class during the lesson. This formed a regression from the previous policy which enabled exempted pupils to engage in alternative creative activities elsewhere in the school building under teachers\u2019 supervision. Based on this circular, a school prohibited a pupil who was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness to leave the classroom during this lesson. The pupil decided to leave the classroom anyway and was repeatedly sanctioned with expulsion for every time that she left the classroom, risking to accumulate so many expulsions that she would be unable to graduate. The Equality Body was quick to take dynamic measures against the school and against the Ministry of Education, threatening them with fines for every day of non-compliance with its recommendations. Its position was that exempted pupils should be offered alternative supervised creative activities that would not lead to their stigmatisation and their alienation from the school environment, as was the solution proposed by the Ministry (to remain in the classroom). 190 The crisis between the Equality Body and the Ministry of Education eventually diffused itself when the Ministry official who vehemently opposed exemptions from the religious class retired in 2013. The dispute as to whether the students exempted from the class will sit in classroom or perform another activity has still not been resolved, but often teachers find an ad hoc solution by asking the student concerned what he or she prefers to do; in fact, 185 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report No. \u0391.\u039a.R. 93/2005, 12 May 2009. 186 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report No. 31/2005, 2 November 2005. 187 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report No. 135/2009, 07 November 2010. 188 Cyprus, Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus, article 18, available at http://cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non- ind/syntagma/full.html. 189 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report No. 31/2005, 02 November 2005. 190 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report no. \u0391.\u039a.R. 93/2012, 03 December 2012.

        "58 some exempted students choose to remain in the class and do something else rather than leave the classroom and be stigmatised. The general practice is for the exempted student to be accommodated in another classroom to attend a different class; in the case of non- native Greek speakers this is usually support Greek language class. In recent years, the Equality Body has toned down its requirement for schools to provide alternative creative occupation for exempted pupils, presumably as a result of the staff shortages that emerge from the government measures to address the economic crisis. A more recent report of the Equality Body on the religious freedom of pupils at school focused on the absence of a culture of neutrality in school activities which clearly favour the dominant religion and on the fact that the right to be exempted from the religious class is reserved only to those pupils who are not Christian orthodox. 191 The odd cases where teachers or headmasters adopt the extreme position and exert pressure on the student, as was the case investigated by the Equality Body cannot be excluded, but remain the exception rather than the rule. 192 In 2012 the Ombudsman 193 investigated a series of complaints from prison inmates who alleged being prevented from practicing their religion. The complaints were Greek nationals of Pontic origin who were denied the right to visit the prison church to celebrate a special holiday for them; and a group of Nigerian inmates who were denied the right to be visited by an Evangelical priest. In both of these cases, the Ombudsman rejected the justification put forward by the prison authorities and urged them to respect the religious rights of detainees and facilitate the practice of any religion they choose. 194 A recent report on Cyprus by the U.S. Department of State indicated that although a mosque and a church are available in the central prison, there is no opportunity and no facilities for detainees in any detention centre to practice their religion. 195 Along the same lines, in 2015 decision the Equality Body found that the failure of the authorities to address the request of a Jehovah\u2019s Witness for bloodless treatment in accordance with his religious beliefs, amounted to a failure to provide equal access to health care. 196 g) Accessibility of services, buildings and infrastructure In Cyprus national law requires services available to the public, buildings and infrastructure to be designed with some accessibility features. In Cyprus national law contains a general duty to provide accessibility by anticipation for people with disabilities. The disability law provides that the failure to carry out alterations to services or facilities which renders their use by a person with a disability unjustifiably difficult does not amount to equal treatment and is therefore prohibited by law. 197 191 Cyprus, Report of the Anti-discrimination Authority regarding the respect of religious freedom at schools of primary and secondary education, File Nos. \u0391\u039aR 1/2014, \u0391\u039aR 6/2014, \u0391\u039aR 19/2014, \u0391\u039aR 73/2014, 18 June 2015.

        "59 The disability law also provides for the right to accessibility to housing, buildings, streets and generally the natural environment and to public transport. 198 None of these rights are absolute however; instead, they are to be implemented through suitable measures ensuring reasonable accommodation to the maximum of available resources. \u2018Reasonable accommodation for the purposes of this provision means necessary and suitable amendments and adjustments which do not require disproportionate or unjustified burden, where necessary in order to ensure the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. A burden is not disproportionate when it is sufficiently balanced by measures taken in the framework of state policy in favour of persons with disability. 199 The accessibility of persons with disabilities to public buildings is further regulated by the Regulations on Streets and Buildings of 1999, which were issued by virtue of Article 19 of the Streets and Buildings law. 200 Regulation 61G defines a person with disability as a person facing temporary or permanent difficulty in accessing a building or a street due to physical weakness or deficiency; the definition is intended to be wide enough to secure accessibility to build infrastructure not only for persons with a disability in the narrow sense of the term but persons generally encountering obstacles in access, such as the elderly. In 2014 the Ministry of the Interior drafted a paper on accessibility and user-safety, to be adopted as an annex to Regulation 61H of the Streets and Buildings Regulations, submitted to the Attorney General for legal processing. 201 The paper is entitled \u201cAccessibility and User Safety\u201d and constitutes the document by which the Reader, 202 being an architect or a civil engineer duly authorized by the competent authority, designs streets and buildings in a manner so as to ensure accessibility and user safety by all persons including persons with disability and with reduced mobility. 203 The report purports to amend Regulation 61H of the Streets and Buildings Regulation 204 and aims at harmonizing national legislation with EU Directive 89/106/EC, according to which structural projects must be designed and constructed in such a way so as to avoid the risk of accident or injury and render them safe and accessible by all persons. When adopted, the paper will have the strength of legislation. The Streets and Buildings Regulations apply to public buildings as well as to those buildings where entry to the public is allowed, to commercial centres, to buildings which include shops and/or offices, to educational institutions, clinics, doctors\u2019 offices and generally to any building which the competent authority decides that these Regulations should apply. The Regulations set the minimum necessary specifications for the erection of all the aforesaid buildings and aim at securing the comfortable access of all persons with disability to the main entrance of such buildings and to the spaces within such buildings. The Regulations provide analytically the construction specifications for ramps to the main entrance, for the pavements, the staircases, the common use corridors, the elevators, the lavatories and other spaces where the public may go in, including the parking areas. However, failure to comply with these regulations does not amount to discrimination. In spite of this legislative framework, an Equality Body decision in 2012 dealt with accessibility to sports grounds and carried out an on-site investigation of these premises, most of which were found to be inaccessible. 205 Also, an Equality Body investigation in 198 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 4(2)(c).

        "60 2009 regarding access to a disabled toilet in the common areas of the building where the complainant resided revealed that the management company of the building did not view accessibility as an unconditional entitlement, because it had asked the complainant to produce a number of documents to prove his disability before they grant him permission to use the disabled communal toilet. The Equality Body report stressed that the law does not set any preconditions which must be met in order for persons facing mobility obstacles to have access to communal toilets, nor does it require such persons to produce any documents to prove their disability. 206 h) Accessibility of public documents The disability law contains a number of vague provisions regarding accessibility, such as the right to access information and communication with special means where this is necessary for special groups of persons, 207 but does not foreseeing for an enforcement mechanism. Beyond these general provisions, which may be used in order to claim Braille translation of basic documents required by law, such as tax declarations, there is no specific legal obligation and no practice for public authorities to provide translation of any documents either in Braille or in sign language.

        "61 3 PERSONAL AND MATERIAL SCOPE 3.1 Personal scope 3.1.1 EU and non-EU nationals (Recital 13 and Article 3(2) Directive 2000/43 and Recital 12 and Article 3(2) Directive 2000/78) In Cyprus, national legislation has incorporated the directives\u2019 residence/citizenship/nationality preconditions for protection under the relevant national laws transposing the directives. Each of the three laws transposing the two directives provides that its scope does not cover differential treatment due to nationality, nor does it affect provisions or conditions regarding the entry and stay of third country nationals and stateless persons, or the treatment derived from the legal status of such third country nationals or stateless persons. 208 In spite of the above, Protocol 12 to the ECHR which Cyprus has ratified, guarantees \u201cthe enjoyment of all rights set forth by law\u201d without discrimination, inter alia, of \u2018national or ethnic origin\u2019. Under Law N.42 (1)/2004 which sets up the Equality Body, there are no residence or citizenship/nationality prerequisites in the body\u2019s mandate in order to extend protection under the national laws transposing the directives. The Equality Body is empowered to promote equality of the enjoyment of rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Cypriot Constitution (Part II) or by the Conventions ratified by Cyprus and referred to in the Law 209 irrespective of race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs, national or ethnic origin. 210 We therefore have a situation where as regards the Equality Body\u2019s mandate nationality is a protected ground, but as regards the scope of the laws transposing the two directives, the exception of the directives as regards nationality applies. In its decisions, the Equality Body has made considerable use of its extended mandate and considered nationality discrimination as prohibited by international laws; on several occasions nationality and ethnic origin has been used interchangeably. The Cypriot Equality Body considers that Union citizens are protected by the two Equality Directives 211 and relies on these Directives in examining complaints submitted by Union citizens. 212 Article 32 of the Constitution stipulates that \u201cnothing in this Part 213 contained shall preclude the Republic from regulating by law any matter relating to aliens in accordance with international law.\u201d This provision, combined with the wide provisions of Cypriot immigration law, is often implemented with a tendency to considerably enlarge the scope of state discretion. Complaints by EU citizens are often filed with the Equality Body alleging nationality discrimination, possibly reflecting the fact that these persons are more familiar with the 208 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment in employment and occupation (\u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u038a\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) 2004 N. 58(I)/2004, Article 5(1).

Some examples of Equality Body decisions concern the failure of the authorities to advise EU citizens of their need to register themselves in the electoral rolls in order to be allowed to vote in municipal elections; the request of the road transport department for EU nationals to present immigration documents evidencing 6 months\u2019 stay in Cyprus in order to acquire a driving license; the refusal of the Ministry of Education to accept the candidacy of a Greek national for an honorary grant; 214 a University\u2019s rejection of a job application because the applicant was a Greek national; the attempts of the immigration authorities to expel Greek nationals who had settled legally in Cyprus before Cyprus\u2019 EU accession for not to have sufficient financial resources to maintain themselves; 215 the requirement of good knowledge of Greek as a prerequisite for accessing public sector jobs or for starting a business; and the refusal of the recruitment bodies in the public sector to recognise prior work experience of applicants who are Greek nationals. 216 3.1.2 Protection against discrimination (Recital 16 Directive 2000/43) a) Natural and legal persons In Cyprus anti-discrimination laws offer protection to persons who meet the definition foreseen in the respective laws. In the case of disability, the definition is clearly met only by natural persons 217 but organisations with a legitimate interest have the right to apply to court or the equality body in order bring a discrimination claim on behalf of a victim. 218 Similarly, all natural persons are protected from religious, age or sexual orientation discrimination only at the workplace 219 since only natural persons meet the definition of an employee, but organisations can represent victims in their claims before the court and the equality body. 220 As regards race/ethnic origin, although no explicit provision is made in the law as to whether victims of ethnic/racial discrimination can be legal or only natural persons, there is no reason why protection may not be extended to organisations of persons who are victims of racial or ethnic discrimination. The law offers explicit protection to individuals who are treated disadvantageously due to their ethnic or racial origin 221 and, in line with article 7(2) of the Racial Equality Directive, organisations may apply to court on behalf of such individuals. 222 In all fields and on all five grounds, the perpetrators of discrimination can be either legal or physical persons.

Natural person may be fined with up to 4,000 Cyprus pounds (6,835 Euros) and/or six months imprisonment or both. 227 If a legal person is found guilty of discrimination, the managing director, chairman, director, secretary or other privileged officer of the legal personality or organisation shall be held guilty for the actions of the legal person and fined with up to 4,000 Cyprus pounds (6,835 Euros) and/or six months imprisonment or both, if it is established that the offence is committed with their consent or collaboration or mere tolerance.

        "64 No explicit provision is made as to who is protected from discrimination but clearly where no protection is foreseen for legal persons, then likewise no protection is available for public sector organisations. 3.2 Material scope 3.2.1 Employment, self-employment and occupation In Cyprus, national legislation applies to all sectors of private and public employment, self -employment and occupation, including contract work, self-employment, holding statutory office, with the exception of military service. 230 As regards military service, the law provides an exception to the prohibition of age discrimination, where the fixing of an age limit is justified by the nature and the duties of the position. 231 The scope of Law N. 58(I)/2004 (transposing the Employment Equality Directive minus the ground of disability) includes conditions of access to employment, to self-employment or to occupation, including selection criteria, recruitment conditions and promotion; access to vocational guidance and training, including practical work experience; employment and working conditions, including dismissals and pay; membership in an organisation of workers or employers, or any organisation whose members carry on a particular profession, including the benefits provided for by such organisations. A law enacted in 2009 introducing quotas in favour of persons with disability in the wider public sector excludes those sections of the public service where \u201call physical, mental or intellectual restrictions must necessarily be absent\u201d 232 which are the army, the police, the fire brigade and the prisons. The Combating of Racial and Some Other Forms of Discrimination (Commissioner) Law 233 which sets out the mandate of the Equality Body, provides that the implementation of Protocol 12 is within such mandate and therefore the Equality Body is empowered to apply this to military service issues. This law also provides that the Equality Body is vested with powers to tackle discrimination in the areas of employment, access to vocational training, working conditions including pay, membership of trade unions or other associations, social insurance and medical care, education and access to goods and services including housing, as required by Article 3.1 of the directives. Both laws transposing the Employment Equality Directive define an \u2018employee\u2019 as \u2018any person who works or is trained in full time or part-time occupation, fixed time or permanent employment, continuous or otherwise, irrespective of the place of employment, including home employees but excluding self-employment. 234 230 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 5(a).

        "65 Article 5 of the ICERD mentions the right to work, but not the conditions for access to employment, to self-employment and to occupation. Comparing article 3.1 (b) of the Employment Equality Directive, Article 5 of ICERD provides for the right to training, whereas the directive focuses on access to all types and to all levels of vocational guidance, (advanced) vocational training and retraining. The comparison between Article 5 of the ICERD and Article 3.1(c) of the directive reveals that the former does not include employment and working conditions relating to dismissal. Article 5 of the ICERD limits itself to the right to form and join trade unions, whilst Article 3.1(d) of the directives is broader in the types of organisation that one can be a member of or involved in and further includes the benefits provided by such organisation or association. 3.2.2 Conditions for access to employment, to self-employment or to occupation, including selection criteria, recruitment conditions and promotion, whatever the branch of activity and at all levels of the professional hierarchy (Article 3(1)(a)) In Cyprus, national legislation includes conditions for access to employment, to self- employment or to occupation, including selection criteria, recruitment conditions and promotion, whatever the branch of activity and at all levels of the professional hierarchy for the five grounds in both private and public sectors as described in the directives. 235 Despite the formal adoption of the four main laws on anti-discrimination, there are no provisions for the facilitation or improvement of conditions for access as required by Article 3(1) (a) of the Employment Equality Directive. There is no tradition of anti-discrimination and there are no specialist lawyers on the subject, nor are there any special mechanisms in the various Government departments created for the implementation of the above provisions. There are currently no measures or mechanisms in order to monitor and collect data on such matters. 3.2.3 Employment and working conditions, including pay and dismissals (Article 3(1)(c)) In Cyprus, national legislation includes working conditions including pay and dismissals, for all five grounds and for both private and public employment. 236 Occupational pensions constituting part of pay The Law on Pensions of 1997-2001, as amended, which regulates the payment of occupational pensions to public employees contains no protection against discrimination. In fact, the Pensions Law itself contains discriminatory provisions, as it provides for less favourable terms for employees aged under 45 who want to take early retirement, compared to older employees. 237 and occupation (\u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u038a\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) 2004 N. 58(I)/2004, Article 2.

        "66 A Supreme Court decision of 2007 238 found that the Pensions Law of 1967 (\u039d.9/67) as amended by Law \u039d.69(1)/2005, introducing differential treatment between persons attaining the age of 60 at different periods, was deemed to be outside the scope of the law transposing the Employment Equality Directive and thus could not be revised as discriminatory. Since then, a number of Court decisions followed suit, where the Courts ruled that pension schemes fixing different retirements ages for different employees, depending on the date of their birth 239 or their rank in their service 240 were outside the scope of the directive and thus no discrimination claim could be allowed. A technical problem that arose in many of these Court cases was that, rather than bring a claim for discrimination under the law transposing the Employment Equality Directive, the claimants would either use the judicial review procedure foreseen by Article 146 of the Constitution or they would seek to have the legal provision affecting them declared unconstitutional. In all these cases, the Court ruled that it had no power to amend the allegedly discriminatory law and/or that annulling a law or a regulation that contains discrimination would not benefit the applicant because it would mean cancelling the legal basis which the desired retirement age derived from. From the Court\u2019s reasoning in cases where applicants complain of discrimination in the amount of pension received, it appears that the Courts were unaware of were unwilling to take into account the CJEU\u2019s ruling in Maruko 241 that occupational pensions constitute part of an employee\u2019s pay under Directive 2000/78 EC. In the case of Michalakis Raftopoulos v. The Republic of Cyprus via the Accountant General of the Republic , the Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claim of age discrimination in respect of his retirement pay, which was lower for persons forced to retire at 61 rather than 62 or 63, on the ground that the directive expressly excludes retirement age from its scope, even though the applicant had not sought to change his retirement age but rather to raise the lump sum payable upon retirement. 242 A Court decision in 2012 found that the retirement age of 55 applicable for lower rank police officers was lawful as the applicant failed to prove that this differential treatment is not reasonable. 243 A Supreme Court decision in 2014 regarding a claim against reduced benefits for a public employee who chose to retire before reaching the age of 45 sought to change the landscape created by the previous Court decisions in this area; the Court not only found that the legal provision for reduced pension benefits for younger retiring employees was unlawful, but it also ruled that the Attorney General was under a duty to proceed with the amendment of this law following the Equality Body\u2019s recommendation to that effect. 244 Although this decision had prepared the ground for further decisions affirming the principle that pension schemes should be free from provisions leading to age discrimination, no more cases appeared before the Court in 2015 in order to test this principle. Instead, the Supreme Court reverted to older judicial practices, upholding that age seniority was a legitimate consideration in 238 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Vassos Constantinou v.

        "67 assessing applications for promotion in the public service. 245 This judicial trend is likely to be challenged in 2016 in light of developments at the level of the CJEU. 246 Maruko case During 2015 a new law was adopted regulating the civil union of both heterosexual and homosexual couples. 247 The law provides for the legal recognition of partnerships registered in accordance with the provisions of this law and applies equally to all persons who choose this procedure, including not only same sex couples but also opposite sex couples who for whatever reason, including reasons of religion or belief choose not to get married. The law provides that unless otherwise stated in the text of the law and with the exception of the law on adoptions, a civil union entered into under this law will have all the corresponding results and consequences of a marriage under the Marriage Law, which regulates civil marriages between heterosexual couples. The law includes detailed provisions regarding the payment of alimony and the distribution of property in the event of dissolution of the civil union, which are almost identical to those provided under the corresponding law for heterosexual married couples. 248 Matters of inheritance are to be regulated by applying the law on wills and succession which applies to married heterosexual couples. 249 In addition to the fields of application expressly mentioned in the law, the state recognition of these relationships will, by inference, inevitably have an impact in other areas of access to state and private services and benefits, including employment-related benefits, occupational pensions, succession in rental and other contracts, access to health as a dependent of a beneficiary and others, even though not explicitly mentioned in the law. The rational of the CJEU in the Maruko case 250 that the surviving partners of deceased employees who had lived with the deceased \u201cin a union of mutual support and assistance which is formally constituted for life\u201d should be entitled to the same benefits as surviving spouses, would probably now be extended to same sex partners who have registered their relationship in accordance with the new law. However, the new law does not fully equate civil unions with marriages. A gap remains on the issue of adoption of children which is expressly excluded from the law and which amounts to direct discrimination against persons choosing the civil union and indirect discrimination against same sex partners. Under this law, a person is deemed incapable of entering into a civil union if he or she has not reached 18 years of age. This differs from the law which regulates the marriage of heterosexual couples and is a potential source of age discrimination: in the case of heterosexual couples, where marriage age is also set at 18, persons under 18 may still marry if they both have completed their sixteenth year of 245 Cyprus, Charis Christodoulidou v Republic of Cyprus through the Public Service Committee, Case No. 12/10, 3 April 2015, available at http://www.cylaw.org/cgi-bin/open.pl?file=apofaseis/aad/meros_3/2015/3- 201504-12-10.htm&qstring=%E4%E9%E1%EA%F1%E9%F3*%20and%202015. 246 After the cut-off date the CJEU ruled against Cyprus on infringement proceedings initiated by the Commission as regards an age criterion in the national pensions law, which may turn the tide of judicial practice away from the doctrine of upholding state discretion: CJEU, C-515/14 (European Commission v Cyprus), 21 January 2016, available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=173688&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mod e=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1024140.

        "68 age and the persons who have parental responsibility over them consent in writing towards this; where the parents or guardians unjustifiably withhold their consent, the Court may authorise its conclusion. 251 This option is not available under this law, presumably because under the Criminal Code intercourse between men under 17 is still a crime punishable with imprisonment, 252 a potential source of discrimination against male homosexuals, as there is no corresponding prohibition for sex between lesbians. 3.2.4 Access to all types and to all levels of vocational guidance, vocational training, advanced vocational training and retraining, including practical work experience (Article 3(1)(b)) In Cyprus, national legislation applies to vocational training outside the employment relationship, such as that provided by technical schools or universities, or such as adult lifelong learning courses. The Law on persons with Disability prohibits discrimination in access to all kinds and levels of vocational guidance, vocational training, educational training, reorientation and professional apprenticeship. 253 The Law on Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation contains an identical provision as regards the remaining four grounds. 254 Neither of the aforesaid provisions specifies whether or not such training must be part of an employment relationship or not. In the absence of a provision restricting the scope to training within employment, it may safely be assumed that the law does apply to vocational training outside the employment relationship, such as that provided by technical schools or universities or other educational establishments, including life-long learning courses. The Equality Body has interpreted this provision as meaning training outside and independently of an employment relationship: in a legal opinion supplied by the Equality Body in 2006 upon the request of a governmental department, it was established that the anti-discrimination laws apply to access to training even if this does not take place within an employment relationship. The case concerned a trainee air traffic controller who suffered vision impairment as a result of which he would probably never be able to work as an air traffic controller. The Equality Body ruled that he should continue his training nevertheless, because denying him access to training on the ground of his disability would amount to discrimination prohibited by law. 255 Other Equality Body decisions found unlawful discrimination in the fixing of an age limit for applying for state scholarships and in the exclusion of persons with disability from admission to the state nursing school. In a 2010 decision the Equality Body stated explicitly that access to an Open University adult life-long learning course amounts to access to vocational training. 256 3.2.5 Membership of, and involvement in, an organisation of workers or employers, or any organisation whose members carry on a particular profession, including the benefits provided for by such organisations (Article 3(1)(d)) 251 Cyprus, Law on marriage of 2003 (\u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03b3\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 2003) N.104(I)/2003, article 15.

        "69 In Cyprus, national legislation includes membership of, and involvement in workers or employers\u2019 organisations as formulated in the directives for all five grounds and for both private and public employment. 257 On 4.11.2005 the Equality Body issued a decision with regard to a clause in the standard employment contract used for the employment of migrant domestic workers, the specimen for which is issued by the Ministry of Labour, which prohibits their involvement in trade unions. The decision found the said clause discriminatory and asked for its deletion from the contract. 258 The prohibition of joining trade unions was finally removed from the standard employment contract of foreign domestic workers but the prohibition of engaging in political activity remains. 259 3.2.6 Social protection, including social security and healthcare (Article 3(1)(e) Directive 2000/43) In Cyprus, national legislation includes social protection, social security and healthcare as formulated in the Racial Equality Directive. National law explicitly prohibits discrimination in the field of social protection, social security and healthcare only on the ground of race/ethnic origin. 260 Article 3(a) of Law 58(I)/2004 (transposing to a large extent the Employment Equality Directive), as well as the Law on Persons with Disability (N.127(I)/2000) seek to rely on the exception in Article 3(3) of the Employment Equality Directive. The Equality Body\u2019s mandate, however, does cover discriminatory treatment in social protection on the grounds of religion/belief, age, disability and sexual orientation and there have been numerous interventions from the Equality Body in this area. Protocol 12 to the ECHR, which becomes operative through the powers granted to the Equality Body 261 prohibits discrimination on all grounds protected under the Protocol in social protection, social security and medical care, without any of the exceptions allowed for above. In a 2005 decision, the Equality Body found that the refusal of public assistance to an asylum-seeker because of his nationality amounted to indirect discrimination on the ground of race or ethnic origin in the area of social protection and social welfare. 262 The refusal of the health authorities to subsidise an under-fertile Pontian Greek citizen to do in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) was also held to be discriminatory. 263 As far as health is concerned, the Equality Body has ruled that the refusal to issue a health card (which entitles free treatment at public hospitals) to asylum-seekers due to the fact that they did not have their \u2018pink 257 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment in employment and occupation ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u038a\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) 2004 N. 58(I)/2004, Article 4 (d).

        "70 slip\u2019 (residence permit) was discriminatory on the ground of ethnic origin. 264 In response, the Ministry of Health sent instructions to public hospitals to issue health cards to asylum seekers even in the absence of pink slips, where there is an emergency. 265 Two Equality Body decisions in 2010 established that the fixing of the age limit of 65 for funding radical prostatectomy and the fixing of the age limit of 40 as a condition of eligibility for financial support for artificial insemination were both discriminatory. 266 In 2012, the Supreme Court also found that there was unlawful discrimination in a scheme which set an age limit as a precondition for entitlement to grant towards taxes and duties related to the acquisition of a car. Using the general prohibition of discrimination of article 28 of the Constitution (which does not explicitly cover age) the Court found that the applicant\u2019s exclusion from the scheme because he was over 70 amounted to unlawful discrimination. 267 More recently in 2015 the Court also found that an age criterion in a disability scheme amounted to discrimination and that the justification of poor state of public finances was insufficient to fall within the exceptions foreseen by the Directives. 268 The Equality Body has repeatedly issued decisions on access to healthcare by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, establishing that the failure of the health authorities to respect their religious beliefs in medical treatment amounted to discrimination. 269 3.2.7 Social advantages (Article 3(1)(f) Directive 2000/43) In Cyprus, national legislation includes social advantages as formulated in the Racial Equality Directive and does not cover any grounds other than racial or ethnic origin. 270 In Cyprus, the lack of definition of social advantages does not raise problems. However, the term \u2018social advantage\u2019 was translated by the official translation unit of the European Commission as \u2018social provisions\u2019 and finds its way in the national legislation in this form. \u2018Social provision\u2019 or \u2018social advantage\u2019 is not included in the scope of the Equality Body\u2019s mandate, which explicitly covers all areas covered by Article 3 of the Racial Equality Directive save for \u2018social advantage\u2019. Social advantage may however be implied into the mandate of the Equality Body as this covers \u201cany field whatsoever\u201d. 271 To the extent that \u2018social advantage\u2019 is state provided, the Ombudsman (which is also the national Equality 264 The three cases were the following: A Palestinian granted subsidiary protection, whose wife was refused medical care even though she was at the very last stage of her pregnancy because she did not have in her possession the temporary residence permit (File No A/P 1339/05). The second complaint came from an Indian asylum seeker whose wife was also in the last month of her pregnancy (File No A/P 1363/05). The third case involved a Kurdish couple from Syria with two underage children who applied for asylum.

        "71 Body) is empowered to deal with it, as part of its mandate to investigate allegations for maladministration in the public sector. Despite the Supreme Court decision in Tetyana Tomko v. Republic of Cyprus which established that differential treatment based on the place of residence (i.e. north or south of Cyprus) is unlawful, the approach followed both by the Courts 272 and the Equality Body is that persons residing in the north of Cyprus, in other words the Turkish Cypriots, are not entitled to state benefits, even if they work in the south and pay their social insurance contributions to the state. 273 In Gonul Ertalu & Imge Ertalu v. Ministry of Finance, the claimant\u2019s application for a student grant was rejected because eligibility depends on residence in the south of the country and the claimant was a Turkish Cypriot residing in the north. 274 The Court followed the same approach in Nebil Yilmaz Aziz Guvenler & Ahmet Guvenler v. Ministry of Finance where the argument of the claimant that the law was unconstitutional for violating the equality principle was rejected because, in the absence of a positive legislative provision entitling the claimant to a student grant, the claimant will derive no benefit if the law is declared unconstitutional. 275 3.2.8 Education (Article 3(1)(g) Directive 2000/43) In Cyprus, national legislation includes education as formulated in the Racial Equality Directive. The national laws transposing the directives explicitly prohibit discrimination in education only in the case of race/ethnic origin. 276 The mandate of the Equality Body covers discrimination in inter alia education on the grounds of race or ethnic origin, religion, belief, community, language, colour, special needs (which covers disability), age and sexual orientation. 277 The Equality Body has repeatedly applied this provision by finding in favour of complainants who alleged discrimination in education on the grounds of not only racial or ethnic origin but also sexual orientation, disability and religion. In recent years, the Equality Body has devoted special attention to homophobia in schools offering a series of recommendations on systemic approaches of addressing the problem. 278 a) Pupils with disabilities In Cyprus the general approach to education for pupils with disabilities does raise problems. Access to integrated education is stipulated as a basic right for all persons with disability but failure to provide such a right is not termed as discrimination. 279 272 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Mehmed and Meral Birinci v.

        "72 As from September 2001 the Ministry of Education applies the Training and Education of Children with Special Needs Law of 1999 (N.113(\u0399)/1999) and Regulations of 2001. In the framework of the said law as amended, as well as the Regulations on the Mechanism for the timely diagnosis of children with special needs of 2001 assistance is provided to children with special needs in all fields, particularly the psychological, social, educational, prevocational and vocational training at schools, where this is possible. The state is under an obligation to provide special training and education to persons with special needs from the age of three until completion of their studies. Such special training and education is provided in the following forms: - In a public school, at an ordinary class, in circumstances of full inclusion with support. In such a case, the school programme and curriculum is adjusted accordingly and a liaison officer is responsible for the child. - In a public school, at a special unit, in circumstances of partial inclusion. The special units are comfortable and accessible spaces in normal schools. The number of children in each unit is determined taking into consideration the special needs, particularities and smooth operation of the unit. - In a special school. This is a special private or public school staffed by specialised personnel (psychologists, speech therapists, doctors, physiotherapists etc.) equipped with modern means to accomplish their mission. The educational policy of these schools includes a system of constant contact of these schools with the normal schools of the same area and the holding of common activities. The special schools are housed in the same premises as normal schools unless the Council of Minsters decides otherwise. - By providing services in other premises. This is an arrangement done in cooperation with the parents and is applicable to children who for health reasons cannot attend any other school. 280 Children with disabilities, physical and intellectual, are as a matter of general policy placed in integrated schools, where necessary with an escort, unless their condition is such that requires that they be placed in a special school. The decision as to whether a pupil with a disability will be placed in one of the special schools is made by a district public committee, 281 comprising of civil servants from a variety of disciplines and departments. The procedure followed by the aforesaid committee is, first, the appointment of a first instance multi-discipline group of experts from the public or the private sector who will evaluate the pupil\u2019s need for special education or special support within mainstream education. For the purposes of this evaluation, the group is furnished with medical reports from the Ministry of Health, the history of the pupil and any information which the parents may wish to supply. Each member of the group will then deliver a report on the pupil setting out the tools and methodology used for the evaluation as well as their findings as to the nature and extend of needed support, in case they consider that such is necessary. 282 The experts\u2019 reports are considered by the district committee who will, following consultation with the parents, make the decision as to whether special schooling is necessary for the pupil in question or not. The author was unofficially informed by the national organisation for the blind that the committee will usually take the following considerations into account when making their decision: the wish of the parents, the assessment of the teachers at the school which the pupil in question is attending, the existence of any learning difficulties or multiple disabilities, or in the case of visual disability the desire of the pupil to learn Braille, which is not offered at mainstream schools. None of these considerations constitute an absolute criterion and each case is looked upon separately.

        "73 disabilities cannot be denied access to education on the ground that they are unable to learn. Integrated education has been the focus of both the Ombudsman and the Child Commissioner 283 in recent years, who have repeatedly criticised the inadequate structures and processes of schools to receive and support children with disabilities, urging the authorities to improve the training of teachers, to increase awareness and enhance coordination amongst professionals, to establish a credible recording mechanism 284 and to create a more effective structure for diagnosis and placement of children in the schools which better address their needs. The fragmentation in support services for both children with disabilities and their parents has in recent years led to a trend towards special education, where the provision of support services is free and more adequate. The economic crisis, the budget cuts and staff shortages at schools are impeding any efforts to improve inclusive education. 285 b) Trends and patterns regarding Roma pupils Roma segregation in schools in Cyprus appears to be an unintended consequence of the state housing policy and in part reflecting discriminatory attitudes, the \u2018cultural capital\u2019 and socio-economic and family conditions of the Roma in Cyprus. The Roma children continue to be treated as pupils with special language requirements, in spite of the fact that Cyprus has ratified a number of international conventions on human rights 286 as well as on specific rights in the field of education. 287 The only complaint ever submitted to the Equality Body regarding the situation of the Roma was filed on 31 January 2008. The resulting investigation by the Equality Body revealed that although the Cypriot government recognised the Roma as a minority within the meaning of the Framework Convention on National Minorities (CNM), the Ministry of Education does not consider the Roma as a separate ethnic group but as belonging to the Turkish Cypriot community, which is why no measures were taken to enhance their Roma identity and culture. 288 Measures for the integration of Romani children are taken in the field of education, albeit targeting all \u201cTurkish-speaking\u201d pupils and not the Roma specifically; there is nothing in the school curriculum on Roma culture or history. These measures consist mainly of Turkish language support teaching, free school uniforms, lunch at school, transport to school etc., in order to encourage school attendance. Most of the Roma pupils attending public schools today are concentrated in one school, the 18th Primary School in Limassol. According to one study, Greek-Cypriot parents try move their children to other schools when they there is a high number of migrant or non-Greek- 283 Cyprus, Commissioner for the Rights of the Child, Position regarding training and education of children with disabilities: Result of public consultation, Nicosia, December 2011.

        "74 Cypriot pupils in their school; 289 if they cannot succeed to move them away, they instruct them to avoid contact with Roma children. 290 Many Greek-Cypriot children do in fact demonstrate racial prejudice towards the Roma children, whilst educationalists believe that they are incapable of integrating. 291 Research with Greek-Cypriot teachers illustrates that many teachers would openly admit being racist. 292 Another study 293 which reflects on the experiences gained from a training project, report that Roma children tend to be marginalized in school, despite official policies of non-segregation and the introduction of supportive measures. The Third ECRI Report on Cyprus noted that \u201c\u2026the Cypriot authorities have used language and displayed attitudes vis-\u00e0-vis these persons that were not conducive to defusing tensions and promoting acceptance of the Roma by the local communities.\u201d 294 In 2014, ECRI issued an interim report on Cyprus 295 in an effort to follow up on the progress made as regards the implementation of its recommendations under its Fourth Report on Cyprus. The interim report focuses on a specific Cypriot public school, the 18th Primary School in Limassol, whose student population is largely made up of Turkish speakers, many of Roma origin. Back in 2011, ECRI had suggested that the authorities assign Turkish-speaking teachers to each class and Turkish-speaking classroom assistants to work alongside and assist the Greek-speaking teachers; employ specialist Greek language teachers; and open the school in the afternoons as an \u201call day school\u201d to permit children who need special support to benefit from extra classes. In response, the authorities informed ECRI that additional support to pupils had been provided and that the number of pupils per class is small (between eight and 19) while the average class size of schools is 25, allowing teachers to cater for the individual needs of pupils more effectively. The system of the optional all-day school was established, offering afternoon tutoring including support language classes, mathematics and computers, as well as a wide range of recreational activities such as physical education, cooking and housekeeping, music, art, theatre, foreign languages and journalism. Teachers receive mandatory in-service training, including teaching Greek as a second language and crisis management. Breakfast, lunch and a snack are provided free of charge to pupils whose families qualify under the new income-related criteria. A physical education teacher was employed by the school to offer classes to Roma pupils four times a week and books for teaching Turkish were acquired. In addition, the school continues to employ an interpreter to help staff communicate better with the parents of Turkish Cypriot pupils. ECRI noted that, in spite of the improvements, 289 Their research is based on an empirical study of one primary school in Limassol with a high concentration of non-indigenous pupils. To quote the research: \u201cthe head teacher reported that the observed school used to be: a high profile school and everyone in the area considered it to have high standards where children could acquire the necessary academic skills. More recently, due to the increasing number of registrations from non-indigenous pupils, many Greek Cypriot parents have stopped sending their children to this school.\u201d See C.

        "75 there continue to be inadequacies in the teaching staff employed at the school, as there are shortages in Turkish-speaking teachers and assistants and in specialist Greek language teachers. The 2015 report on Cyprus by the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention on National Minorities expressed concern over a number of issues regarding the situation of the Roma in education including: 296 - The absence of structured dialogue with Roma representatives and the absence of any comprehensive efforts on behalf of the authorities to systematically obtain more information on their specific background and the particular problems facing Roma children in education. The report refers to a deterioration in the general climate of solidarity and respect for diversity in society as a result of the economic crisis, adding that the efforts by the authorities to promote multi-cultural education remain insufficient. - Reports of incidents of racial prejudice against Roma in schools and of Greek parents removing their children from certain schools perceived as having \u2018too many\u2019 non- Greek Cypriot students. - Equal access to education and equal opportunities in the education system remain elusive for Roma children, as several of the challenges documented in older studies, such as irregular school attendance, early drop-outs, overall low academic achievement and small numbers of students continuing to secondary school, remained. - No efforts have been made to include information on the Roma and their distinct cultural heritage and history in Cyprus in the school curriculum and education materials. A report published by the Commissioner for the Rights of the Child at the end of 2013 also recorded a rather problematic situation at the school. 297 The report, issued in response to a complaint by the head of the school on behalf of the staff, criticised the head master and school staff for the tone of their letter of complaint which was described as \u2018insulting for the Roma children, if not racist\u2019. In particular, the Commissioner criticised the headmaster\u2019s allegations that Roma children have no inclination towards leaning, they constantly create problems due to their antisocial behaviour, their parents have no interest in the education of their children and as a result all the other children are deprived of their basic education. The Commissioner\u2019s investigation identified the following problems at the school: - The school staff is not adequately trained on managing or teaching in multicultural settings. - The Roma children are not recognised as Roma or as Muslim but merely as Turkish- Cypriots. When they are first enrolled to the school, they have no knowledge of Greek. - Due to language barriers, the school staff cannot communicate with the parents of the Roma children. The school authorities blame the parents for constantly moving from place to place, resulting in their children having a fragmented school experience. The parents are seen by the school authorities as failing to support their children to take the school seriously. - The school does not offer adequate teaching support hours for the pupils. 296 Council of Europe (2015), Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Fourth Opinion on Cyprus , 2 November 2015.

        "76 - The teachers blame the housing and living conditions of the Roma pupils and issues of domestic violence for the Roma children\u2019s problems at school. - The support offered by the Welfare Services and by the Educational Psychology Service of the Ministry of Education is inadequate. - The Roma children\u2019s mother tongue is a mixture between Turkish and the local Roma dialect, Kurbertcha, which is not recognised as a language of instruction. - The continuous reduction of the school\u2019s Greek Cypriot population demonstrates that the school has failed to convince of its potential as a model multicultural setting. No figures are available as regards the number of Roma children in education, because the Roma are seen by the authorities as inseparable from the Turkish Cypriots and no separate data are maintained for them. In September 2012, 18th Primary School in Limassol enrolled 73 children, of whom 40 were \u2018Turkish Cypriots\u2019, 23 were Greek Cypriots and the rest were from other countries. 298 3.2.9 Access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public (Article 3(1)(h) Directive 2000/43) In Cyprus, national legislation includes access to and supply of goods and services as formulated in the Racial Equality Directive. 299 In addition, the law amending the Ratification law of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination of 1967, No. 11 of 1992, provides that any person who supplies goods and services by way of profession and refuses such goods or services to any person solely due to his/her racial or ethnic origin or religion is guilty of a criminal offence. 300 Distinction between goods and services available publicly or privately In Cyprus national laws do not distinguish between goods and services available to the public and those only available privately and it can safely be assumed that they apply to both. Disability National legislation also provides for equality of treatment of persons with disabilities with the rest of the citizens of the Republic in the provision of goods, facilities or services; differential treatment amounts to discrimination when the reason for such treatment is related to the person\u2019s disability and it is not \u201cjustified\u201d. 301 No duty is cast on manufacturers to manufacture products which are easily useable by persons with disabilities although there is an obligation on service providers to make adaptations and to offer facilities in order to make premises or services accessible to persons with disabilities. 302 The disability law provides that public transport must be suitably modified for the entry and safe transportation of persons with disabilities, including persons using wheelchairs.

        "77 of Ministers; no such regulations have as yet been issued and public transport remains to a large extent inaccessible. 303 The disability law also requires that the competent governmental departments must, within a short period of time, proceed to the installation of a suitable system of telephone services which assists persons with a hearing disadvantage or with any other disability of the senses or other speech disability to communicate through the telephone system in a manner proportionate to those persons without such disadvantages. Under the same provision, there must be public means of telecommunication accessible to persons with disabilities, including persons using wheelchairs; and television stations must make arrangements so that at certain hours sign language is available for news broadcasts. 304 The law which sets out the mandate of the Equality Body prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on all five grounds foreseen by the directives plus community, language and colour, in all fields covered by the directives including the supply of goods and services. 305 3.2.10 Housing (Article 3(1)(h) Directive 2000/43) In Cyprus, national legislation includes housing discrimination as formulated in the Racial Equality Directive. Discrimination on the ground of race and ethnic origin in housing is prohibited by article 4(1)(e) of Law 59(I)/2004 (transposing the Racial Equality Directive). The relevant provision refers to \u201cthe access to goods and services available to the public and the supply thereof, including housing\u201d as one of the fields of application. Housing discrimination forms part of the mandate of the Equality Body on all five grounds foreseen by the directives plus community, language and colour. 306 Also, the wide ambit of the general prohibition of discrimination found in article 28 of the Constitution may be used to pursue a housing discrimination claim on \u2018any ground whatsoever\u2019. Access to one\u2019s own property is not deemed by the Courts to fall within the meaning of the term \u2018housing\u2019. A 2007 Supreme Court decision on an application for referral to the CJEU of the question whether article 2 of the Racial Equality Directive could be interpreted in a manner permitting an EU member state to deny the lawful owner of a property the right to sell it was rejected in a decision where the judge stated that the issue at stake (access to property) was deemed to be outside the scope of the directive. 307 Some restrictions apply in the field of acquisition of immovable property by non-Cypriots, under the Acquisition of Immovable Property (Aliens) Law, which require non-Cypriots to apply for permit before they can register immovable property in their name.

        "78 In 1999-2000, a large number of Roma migrated from the Turkish-Cypriot controlled north of Cyprus to the south. Once they crossed over, most of them settled in abandoned and derelict properties within old Turkish quarter of Limassol which the Turkish Cypriots were forced to vacate several decades ago. Many of these houses were without doors or windows, sanitary system, electricity or water supply. By 2003, approximately 360 Roma persons had settled in these properties, without any preceding repair works. The arrival of the Roma families in the south 1990-2000 was greeted with fear and suspicion by the local communities as well as by the authorities. 308 The then Minister of Justice alleged in a public statement that the Roma families may well be \u2018Turkish spies\u2019 309 whilst the then Minister of the Interior assured Greek-Cypriots that the authorities would \u201censure that they will be moved to an area that is far away from any place where there are people living.\u201d 310 The Third ECRI Report on Cyprus notes that \u201c\u2026the Cypriot authorities have used language and displayed attitudes vis-\u00e0-vis these persons that were not conducive to defusing tensions and promoting acceptance of Roma by the local communities.\u201d 311 At the beginning of this influx, some Roma families were detained in Central Prison; this practice was discontinued when the Attorney General ruled it as illegal. 312 In addition, two more settlements were created in two remote villages within the Paphos district (Makounda and Polis Chrysochoos) where the housing conditions are also appalling. 313 In her Annual Report for 2003 the Ombudsman 314 referred to an investigation carried out by her office into these settlements where most families were residing in temporary structures set up by themselves made of corrugated iron, wood, carton and plastic and without electricity and pointed out that for the purpose of harmonisation with the EU acquis the authorities must compile an action plan using a holistic approach for eliminating ethnic segregation and for respecting the diversity of the Roma. 315 A subsequent report released by the Ombudsman on 30.06.2003 expressed concerns about the failure of the authorities to implement policies decided in March 2000 that were designed to tackle homelessness and unemployment amongst the Roma. 316 Over the past few years there has been an effort to regenerate the old Turkish Cypriot quarter of Limassol and some of the old houses were repaired. Some of the houses inhabited by the Roma have been maintained and repaired by the government, but the pace of repairs is slow and the condition of the houses remains substandard and often unfit for human habitation. Also a multi-purpose community centre was set up in the Turkish quarter, which aimed at taking action towards integrating the Roma and promoting their participation within the local community. However, the building remains closed most of the time as no arrangements or budget were allocated for a full timer to be present. In recent 308 Hadjicosta, M.

        "79 years, reports of evictions of Roma families from the old Turkish quarter of Limassol, on the justification that intelligence reports have shown them to own properties in the Turkish- occupied north of the country have coincided with a general increase in property value in the region, as a result of the creation of an ambitious commercial project nearby.

        "80 4 EXCEPTIONS 4.1 Genuine and determining occupational requirements (Article 4) In Cyprus national legislation provides an exception for genuine and determining occupational requirements. 317 In addition, the disability law excludes from its scope activities where, by virtue of their nature or context, a characteristic or ability which a person with a disability lacks, constitute a substantial and determining precondition, provided the aim is legitimate and the precondition is proportionate, taking into consideration the possibility of adopting \u2018reasonable measures\u2019. 318 4.2 Employers with an ethos based on religion or belief (Article 4(2) Directive 2000/78) In Cyprus national law provides an exception for employers with an ethos based on religion or belief. 319 Article 110 of the Cypriot Constitution provides for complete autonomy of the established religious organisations/churches of the two Cypriot communities, the Christian Orthodox church for the Greeks and the Vakf for the Muslim Turks. Under Article 110.1, the \u201cAutocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus\u201d has \u201cthe exclusive right of regulating and administering its own internal affairs and property in accordance with the Holy Canons and its charter in force for the time being and the Greek Communal Chamber shall not act inconsistently with such right\u201d. Similarly, under Article 110.2 \u201cthe institution of Vakf and the Principles and Laws of, and relating to, Vakfs are recognised by this constitution\u201d. From the above Article it is apparent that the extent of the autonomy and right to self-regulation granted to the Church under the Constitution is wider than that allowed by Article 7 of Law 58(I)/2004. Pursuant to a law which came into force in July 2006 amending the Constitution to the effect that EU directives and regulations prevail over national legislation (including the Constitution), it can safely be assumed that the provisions of Law 58(I)/2004 will prevail over the Constitution as the former transposes an EU directive. However, and in spite of the constitutional amendment, the Courts in Cyprus are not always willing to prioritise laws transposing the acquis over national legislation; there are several examples where in the case of conflict the Courts chose to apply the national law rather than the law transposing the acquis. \uf02d Conflicts between rights of organisations with an ethos based on religion or belief and other rights to non-discrimination In Cyprus there are no specific provisions or case law on conflicts between the rights of organisations with an ethos based on religion or belief and other rights to non- discrimination. However, the autonomy of Greek orthodox religious bodies to manage their affairs may raise issues of compatibility with the directives. Although there is no relevant court decision or Equality body statement, one may safely assume that church organisations: are unlikely to employ non-Orthodox Christians in key positions since they cannot become priests in the orthodox church of Cyprus; will not hire women since they are not allowed to become priests; and will not hire homosexuals since homosexuality continues to be considered by 317 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment in employment and occupation ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u038a\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) 2004 N. 58(I)/2004, Article 5(2).

        "81 the church as a sin. In practice, organisations with an ethos based on religion, such as the Bishoprics, often have no hesitation in hiring Muslims or Catholics for manual jobs such as working in the fields owned by the Bishoprics. 320 Under article 7 of Law N. 58(I)/2004, \u201cin the case of occupational activities within churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, a difference of treatment based on a person's religion or belief shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which they are carried out, a person's religion or belief constitute a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation's ethos\u201d. This exception does not cover sexual orientation and the scope of this Law does not cover gender. Therefore, any difference in treatment at the workplace on the ground of gender or sexual orientation is unlawful. In the case of religion, difference in treatment is lawful if the test laid down in article 7 of Law 58(I)/2004 is satisfied. There have not been any cases in court or examined by the Equality Body as regards the clash between religion and sexual orientation, however the Orthodox Church repeatedly expressed its opposition to the civil cohabitation law, which were not taken on board by the legislators. \uf02d Religious institutions affecting employment in state funded entities In Cyprus religious institutions are not officially permitted to select people (on the basis of their religion) to hire or to dismiss from a job when that job is in a state entity, or in an entity financed by the State. There is however public discourse on church intervention particularly at schools and criticisms against the church for trying to interfere with selection of candidates for a job placement and with the hiring process either by using its influence or by financing positions at the University of Cyprus in order to be filled by a person of their choice. Given that by far the most powerful of religious institutions in Cyprus is the Greek-orthodox church, and the dominant community in Cyprus is the Greek Cypriot, whose members are mostly of Greek orthodox religion, the issue of conflict or contestation does not often arise; the intervention of the Greek orthodox church, where such intervention takes place, is rather intended to promote a particular person for a specific job for reasons which are not exclusively of a religious nature, given that the Cypriot church operates businesses of significant capital such as banks and hotels. 4.3 Armed forces and other specific occupations (Article 3(4) and Recital 18 Directive 2000/78) In Cyprus national legislation provides an exception for the armed forces in relation to age or disability discrimination. The disability law does not apply to the armed forces, to the extent that the nature of the occupation is such that it requires special skills which cannot be exercised by persons with disabilities. 321 The same exception appears as a reservation by the Republic of Cyprus in the ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified in 2011. Law 58(I)/2004 transposing the Employment Equality Directive provides that the prohibition of discrimination on the ground of age shall not apply to the armed forces, to the extent that the fixing of an age limit is justified by the nature and the duties of the occupation. 322 320 Interview with Petros Lazarou, secretary of the Morphou Bishopric, 16 January 2005. 321 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) Article 3A(1)(a).

        "82 A law which came into force in late 2009 introducing a quota system in favour of persons with disability in the wider public sector excludes from its scope those sections of the public service where \u201call physical, mental or intellectual restrictions must necessarily be absent\u201d, which are the army, the police, the fire department and the prisons. 323 4.4 Nationality discrimination (Article 3(2)) a) Discrimination on the ground of nationality In Cyprus the national law transposing the equality Directives includes the Directives\u2019 exceptions relating to difference of treatment based on nationality. 324 However, nationality is explicitly mentioned as a protected ground in the law ratifying Protocol No. 12 to the ECHR, article 1 of which provides for freedom from discrimination on the grounds of, inter alia, national or social origin, association with a national minority birth or other status. 325 A similar provision is also to be found in the law setting up the Equality Body which bestows the Equality Body with the task of promoting equality in the enjoyment of rights and freedoms arising under international instruments ratified by Cyprus, irrespective of, inter alia, national or ethnic origin and of protecting individuals from discrimination by public as well as by private bodies on the grounds provided in the law, which include nationality. 326 On 16 January 2007 a complaint was submitted to the Equality Body alleging that the law on the acquisition of citizenship by descent is discriminatory. The said law provides that children born to parents, one of whom unlawfully entered or resides in the Republic, do not automatically become citizens of Cyprus even if the other parent holds or would have been entitled to Cypriot citizenship; that these children can become citizens only following a decision of the Council of Ministers. 327 This provision is intended to vest the Council of Ministers with the power to decide whether or not to grant nationality to children born to a Turkish Cypriot parent and a Turkish parent, where the latter is deemed to fall within the category of \u201cTurkish settlers\u201d. The complaint alleged that the said provision was discriminatory contrary to the Constitution and international obligations of the Republic, as the rendering of a child\u2019s nationality conditional on the status of \u2018legality\u2019 or \u2018illegality\u2019 of the parents, or even worse of one of the two parents, not only violates the rights of the child, as provided for in the UN Convention for the Rights of the Child, but also constitutes discrimination against the children who are victimised by the political situation and whom the Republic has an obligation to protect. Due to the lack of transparency in these procedures, it is not possible to assess the impact or to monitor implementation of this law. The Equality Body\u2019s decision recognised that the examination of applications under the said provision are often unnecessarily delayed but given that the Council of Minister\u2019s decision is governmental policy, it cannot intervene any further.

        "83 discrimination was not examined, as the report accepted that children may legitimately be discriminated against when one of the two parents entered Cyprus under the status of the \u201cTurkish settler\u201d. 328 The Third ECRI Report on Cyprus 329 notes that \u2018decisions to grant nationality have resulted in intolerant and xenophobic attitudes in public debate\u2019 noting that the relevant provisions of the nationality law are contrary to art. 5 of the 1997 European Convention on Nationality, which Cyprus is yet to sign, and contrary to the general prohibition of discrimination in article 1 of Protocol 12 to the ECHR. In 2011 the Equality Body dealt with several complaints from Turkish Cypriots regarding the granting of Cypriot nationality to their children. Although this report makes extensive reference to ECRI\u2019s position on the matter, the Equality Body does not entirely adopt ECRI\u2019s position that discrimination exists. Instead, the Equality Body adopted the governmental position that the current policy is necessary in order to address Turkey\u2019s policy of demographic change, but urged the authorities to speed up the processing of applications and to promptly notify failed applicants in order to avoid claims for maladministration and discrimination. 330 Over the years, the Equality Body has issued a number of decisions applying the two Equality Directives to Union citizens. 331 Indeed, the interpretation given by the Equality Body to the Directives is that their scope does not exclude Union citizens. 332 b) Relationship between nationality and \u2018race or ethnic origin\u2019 In its decisions, the Equality Body has made use of its extended mandate and considered nationality discrimination as prohibited by international laws; in some occasions nationality and ethnic origin has been used interchangeably, in the sense that whilst the case at stake was clearly one of nationality discrimination, the decision would also invoke the provisions of the laws transposing the anti-discrimination directives. The interaction between nationality and race/ethnic origin is nowhere more apparent than in the case of the Turkish Cypriots who, although Cypriot citizens under the Constitution, appear to have an \u2018inferior\u2019 form of citizenship due to their ethnicity, as illustrated by the restrictions they face in exercising their voting rights, in the grant of nationality for their children, in accessing their properties in the Republic controlled areas, etc. An Equality Body decision has established that the exclusion of non-Cypriot EU citizens from a scheme of granting heating allowance amounted to discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin as well as of national origin under Protocol 12 to the ECHR. 333 Similarly, the exclusion of a Greek national from the list of persons eligible to be awarded honorary artistic pensions was found by the Equality Body to be discriminatory. 334 Also, the denial of access to EU citizens to the electoral register for the purpose of voting at local elections was held to be discriminatory on the basis of race or ethnic origin. 335 More recently, the Equality Body found that an employment scheme with a stringent Greek language requirement amounted to a breach of the Law on Combating Racial and Other Forms of 328 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report No. 10/2007, 24 March 2008. 329 ECRI (2006), Third Report on Cyprus, Adopted on 16 December 2005, Strasbourg 16 May 2006. 330 Cyprus, Anti-discrimination Authority, Report on the handling of applications for citizenship by Turkish Cypriots, 30 November 2011. 331 Position of the Commissioner for Administration and Human Rights regarding complaints to the Equality Authority no.

        "84 Discrimination 336 in combination with the Law on Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation, 337 as it resulted in discrimination against EU citizens and third country nationals. In 2012 the Supreme Court also ruled on nationality discrimination but not from the perspective of the discriminated victim: the case concerned a Cypriot landlord who applied to the Rent Control Court in order to evict his Romanian tenant. The Rent Control Court denied having jurisdiction, because the scope of the Rent Control Act does not include non- Cypriots. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that the reference in the law to Cypriots should be read as including all EU nationals. 338 The exclusion of third country nationals from the scope of the Rent Control Act has been the subject of an investigation from the Equality Body which recommended its revision 339 and has also been criticised by the UN Committee on Eliminating Racial Discrimination. 340 4.5 Work-related family benefits (Recital 22 Directive 2000/78) a) Benefits for married employees In Cyprus it would probably not constitute unlawful discrimination in national law if an employer only provides benefits to those employees who are married, as this issue is not explicitly dealt with by any law, although a single person who was subjected to differential treatment on account of his or her marital status could invoke the general anti- discrimination provision of the Cypriot Constitution, whose scope covers \u2018any ground whatsoever\u2019. There is no academic discussion or jurisprudence on the scope of the meaning of this open-ended provision but it has been repeatedly cited in Court to claim discrimination even in contexts where no particular ground was invoked. The payment of work-related family benefits by employers is not expressly regulated by law in either the public or the private sector. In order to determine the legality of any provision or non-provision of work-related benefits, recourse must be made to the general anti-discrimination principles contained in the framework legislation. \u2018Family condition\u2019 is included in the prohibited grounds of discrimination in Article 28 of the Constitution which, under the Yiallourou case 341 is applicable per se both in the public and the private sector. Apart from those sectors in which collective agreements are in force, all other benefits provided by employers must be considered as part of the employment contract, the conditions of which may legitimately vary from employee to employee. In practice, both in the private as well as in the public sector, free or subsidised medical care schemes are commonly made available to employees\u2019 spouses.

        "85 treatment of the unmarried employees but there is no record of such practices to lead to any conclusions as to unmarried spouses are in fact excluded and to what extent; furthermore, the granting of benefits to married couples only, amounts to indirect discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, given that same sex couples are unable to marry in Cyprus. The new law on civil unions 342 does not specifically cover work-related benefits, presumably because there is no legislation regulating these for opposite-sex couples either. However, the new law in combination with the principle established by the CJEU in Maruko , 343 which precludes legislation depriving the surviving partner from a survivor\u2019s benefit equivalent to that granted to a surviving spouse, may presumably be used in order to afford same sex partners who have registered their cohabitation in accordance with the new law on civil unions, the same benefits as regards work related benefits with those accruing to married couples. Regulation 12 of the Educational Officers (Placements, Transfers and Movements) Regulations of 1987 to 1994 sets the family condition of the employee (i.e. whether he/she is married and has dependent children) as one of the criteria in determining whether such employee will be transferred to a teaching post away from his/her base. A decision of the Equality Body regarding this provision found that the differential treatment of unmarried employees vis-\u00e0-vis married employees without children amounts to indirect discrimination against persons who remain single out of personal conviction, or who choose to co-habit with their partners outside marriage or who do not marry due to their sexual orientation, in other words it amounts to discrimination on the ground of belief and/or sexual orientation. The Equality Body asked for this regulation to be revised 344 but until the date of writing no steps had been taken in that direction. b) Benefits for employees with opposite-sex partners In Cyprus there is no law regulating the payment of benefits to employees in the private sector. Generally speaking, benefits are seen as forming part of an employment relationship that may legitimately differ from employee to employee. Under article 28 of the Constitution, a person subjected to differential treatment on any ground whatsoever may bring an action for discrimination and collect damages, subject to producing evidence that the differential treatment was the result of discriminating between two equals, as it is normal and legitimate for employees at different ranks of the hierarchy to receive different benefits. The recently adopted law on civil unions which enables same sex or opposite sex couples to register their relationship does not explicitly cover work-related benefits but it provides impetus for employers to treat these employees equally, compared to the previous regime of unregistered relationships. The issue of benefits to employees increasingly becomes an academic one as Cypriot economy sinks further and further into crisis and austerity becomes a harsh reality for those still in employment, who see benefits and labour rights vanish into an uncertain future. 4.6 Health and safety (Article 7(2) Directive 2000/78) a) Exceptions in relation to disability and health/safety In Cyprus there are exceptions in relation to disability and health and safety. 342 Cyprus, Law on Civil Marriages of 2015 ( O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 2015 ), 184(I)/2015, 9 December 2015.

        "86 The disability law excludes from its scope measures for the protection of \u201chealth and the rights and freedoms of others\u201d. 345 The same law further provides that the principle of equal treatment does not prevent the maintaining or introduction of regulations for the protection of health and safety at the workplace, or measures aimed at creating or maintaining requirements or facilities intended to preserve or encourage the inclusion of persons with disabilities. 346 Law 58(I)/2004 transposing the Employment Equality Directive also excludes from its scope measures provided by national legislation which are necessary for, inter alia, the \u201cprotection of health and the rights and freedoms of others\u201d, unless the differential treatment is due to a person\u2019s racial or ethnic origin, in which case it presumably constitutes unlawful discrimination. 347 No exceptions are allowed relating to religion or other grounds where issues of dress or personal appearance are concerned. It should be noted, however, that for the moment there are no such issues or debates in Cyprus, as there are hardly any ethnic communities using symbols of religion or culture. Up until recently, the vast majority of Muslims of Cyprus, which are basically the Turkish-Cypriots, the Roma, migrant workers and asylum seekers from the Middle East were either secular or simply not using symbols in their appearance, however there have been increasing NGO reports recently about members of Nicosia\u2019s growing Muslim population being unable to find work as a result of wearing their religious symbols (headscarf, dress etc.). 348 4.7 Exceptions related to discrimination on the ground of age (Article 6 Directive 2000/78) 4.7.1 Direct discrimination In Cyprus national law provides an exception for direct discrimination on age. a) Justification of direct discrimination on the ground of age In Cyprus it is possible in specified circumstances, to justify direct discrimination on the ground of age; national law contains exactly the same exception for age as found in Article 6 of the Employment Equality Directive. 349 No case has so far been presented before the Cypriot Courts or the Cypriot Equality Body raising the issues examined in Mangold or in Kucukdeveci, nor are there any national laws providing for the conclusion of fixed term contracts once an employee reaches a certain age or for ignoring the period of employment completed by an employee before reaching 25 when calculating the notice period for dismissal. A study of the relevant cases decided by the Court and by the Equality Body reveals significant differences between the treatments afforded to this issue by the two bodies. Court decisions in recent years have sought to justify differences in retirement ages for employees of different rank or different age, introducing a rather wide spectrum of 345 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) Article 3A(2).

        "87 exceptions premised upon a doctrine that \u2018unequal\u2019 situations must be treated differently and/or that discrimination must be unreasonable in order to be prohibited. 350 By contrast, the Equality Body appears better informed about the relevant provision in the law transposing Directive 2000/78 and about legal developments in the CJEU and will use the test provided in the law (objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim and means must be appropriate and necessary); the Equality Body is more likely to find that there is prohibited age discrimination in differential treatment on the ground of age rather than the Courts. 351 A Supreme Court decision in late 2014 regarding a claim against reduced benefits for a public employee who chose to retire before reaching the age of 45 may mark a new departure for Court decisions in this area, as the Court found that the legal provision for reduced pension benefits for younger retiring employees was discriminatory and thus unlawful. 352 The same provision was also the subject of a CJEU ruling against Cyprus which found that it led to discrimination between different categories of employees. 353 b) Permitted differences of treatment based on age In Cyprus national laws may permit differences of treatment based on age for activities within the material scope of Directive 2000/78. Although the exception of Article 6(2) of the Employment Equality Directive is not specifically invoked in national legislation, there are provisions in the law regulating the payment of benefits under pension schemes in the public service, which depend at least partly on age. In particular, the Law Amending the Pensions Laws of 1997-2001 N. 69(I)2005 provides that the lump sum payable to public servants upon retirement is paid upon the attainment of certain ages in combination with the completion of a certain term of service. This provision was the subject of an application to the Supreme Court claiming that it ought to be annulled for non-compliance with the equality principle, which was rejected by the Court on the ground that retirement ages fall outside the scope of the Employment Equality Directive and that the lump sum which the claimant was contesting at stake was related to the duration of his service and not to his contributions. 354 Entitlement to other benefits is linked to the term of service but also, in some cases, to the mandatory pensionable age, which is determined by this law. Article 49(2) of the Public Service Laws 1990-1996 provides that the element of age seniority may be taken into consideration as a criterion for selection of the candidate to be promoted, as a last resort where the candidates are otherwise deemed as equal. Besides this law, there is a long list of laws regulating the payment of benefits under pension schemes to employees in the various governmental and semi-governmental bodies, most of which follow the pattern of the aforesaid law, i.e. benefits become payable upon completion of a certain term of service and/or upon attainment of a certain age and/or upon attainment of pensionable age.

        "88 that the provision of the Pensions Law providing for fewer benefits for employees under 45 wishing to take early retirement, compared with employees over 45, was in violation of the equality principle, which was later confirmed by the Supreme Court. 355 The Equality Body, however, appears willing to accept the criterion of the number of years in service as a determining factor differentiating groups of employees, by recommending the adoption of a condition that pension benefits are payable upon completion of certain years of service irrespective of age, which is also indirectly related to age. 356 In 2015 the Supreme Court ruled that, all other things being equal, age seniority is a legitimate criterion in determining promotions in the public service. 357 c) Fixing of ages for admission or entitlements to benefits of occupational pension schemes In Cyprus national law allows occupational pension schemes to fix ages for admission to the scheme or entitlement to benefits, taking up the possibility provided for by article 6(2). 358 In the public sector benefits under pension schemes depend at least partly on age. In the private sector, pension schemes are regulated either by collective agreements (where such exist in the particular sector) or by individual employment contracts, where the conditions of eligibility for benefits are impossible to monitor. It is possible that any collective or individual agreement which discriminates on other grounds will be held unlawful on the basis of article 4(c) of Law 58(I)/2004, transposing article 3.1(c) of the Employment Equality Directive on conditions of employment, subject of course to the exception in article 6(2) of the Directive (transposed by article 8(3) of Law 58(I)/2004). 4.7.2 Special conditions for young people, older workers and persons with caring responsibilities In Cyprus there are special conditions set by law for older and younger workers in order to promote their vocational integration, and for working persons with dependents in order to ensure their protection. Law 58(I)/2004 transposing the Employment Equality Directive provides that differential treatment in the form of special conditions for access to employment and vocational training, employment and occupation including dismissal and remuneration conditions, for young and old persons and for working persons with dependents, so as to promote their vocational integration or ensure their protection, shall not constitute discrimination. 359 However, no such measures or special conditions are actually provided by this law or by any other law or regulation.

        "89 responsibilities towards a person with disability is discrimination prohibited by law. 361 This principle has also been recorded in the Code of Conduct for disability discrimination at the workplace issued by the Equality Body in September 2010 which has a binding effect. 362 A more recent Equality Body decision found that in order for the principle of discrimination by association to apply, there is no need for the carer to be the parent or the spouse of the person with disability; instead, one needs to look into the facts of each individual case and determine whether the person discriminated is in fact the primary carer of the person with disability. 363 4.7.3 Minimum and maximum age requirements In Cyprus there are exceptions permitting minimum and/or maximum age requirements in relation to access to employment and training. The law allows the fixing of minimum age limits, professional experience or seniority and the fixing of maximum limits for access to employment based on the training required for the particular position or the need for a reasonable period of employment prior to retirement, provided the measure is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means are necessary and legitimate. 364 In addition, the law provides an exception relating to the armed forces, where the principle of non- discrimination on the ground of age is stated to be inapplicable to the extent that the fixing of an age limit is justified by the nature and the duties of the work. 365 The law does not specify the age limit applicable in this case, which is determined by the service schemes of the armed forces. Also, the 2009 law setting quotas in favour of persons with disability in the wider public sector excludes the army, the police, the fire department and the prisons from the ambit of the law. 366 In 2008 a Labour tribunal found that the fixing of an upper age limit in a job advertisement by a credit institution was unlawful but awarded the claimant only a small fraction of the compensation sought (\u20ac 1,500 as opposed to her claim of \u20ac 555,754). 367 Upon appeal, 368 the Supreme Court confirmed the trial court\u2019s finding on this point, because the claimant would not have been hired anyway since the other candidates were better qualified, based on the principle expounded by the ECJ in the case of Draehmpaehl. 369 In 2012, the Equality 361 Cyprus, Equality Authority, Report No. A.K.I. 82/2009, 25 June 2010. 362 Cyprus, Equality Authority (2010), Code of Conduct for discrimination on the ground of disability in employment and occupation ( \u039a\u03ce\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a0\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 ).

        "90 Body found that the age limit of 55 for recruitment in the position of a cultural attach\u00e9 at the House of Cyprus in Athens was unlawful. 370 More recently the Court ruled that the maximum age of 65 for claiming benefit under a disability scheme was unlawful 371 and the Ministry of Health adopted the Equality Body\u2019s recommendation to remove the age limit of 65 for eligibility to state sponsorship for robotic prostatectomy. 372 4.7.4 Retirement a) State pension age In Cyprus there is a state pension age, at which individuals must begin to collect their state pensions. If an individual wish to work longer, the pension cannot be deferred. Contributions to the state social insurance scheme can only be paid until the person reaches \u2018pensionable age\u2019. 373 In the private sector an individual can collect a pension and still work; this is a matter regulated by the individual employment contract. Public sector employees may not work past their retirement limit. 374 However, it is possible for retired public servants to be appointed to another paid public post without losing their state pension. Although a law introduced in 2011 sought to reduce the state pension of public sector employees who take up another paid public position after retirement, 375 a Supreme Court decision in 2014 found this law unconstitutional and restored the state pensions for this category of pensioners. 376 b) Occupational pension schemes In Cyprus, there is no normal age when private sector employees can begin to receive payments from occupational pension schemes or from other employer-funded pension arrangements. The private sector has up until now generally considered the age of 65 as retirement age, although this is not mandatory and deviations are not prohibited. The content of private pension schemes is regulated by private agreements and no generalisations can be made as to the terms customarily used. 370 Cyprus, Equality Authority, Report No. AKI 30/2011, 23 May 2012. 371 Cyprus, Petros Michaelides v The Republic of Cyprus through the Minister of Labour and Social Insurance, Supreme Court, Review Jurisdiction, Case No. 2005/2012, 27 January 2016, available at http://cylaw.org/cgi-bin/open.pl?file=apofaseis/aad/meros_4/2016/4-201601-2005- 2012.htm&qstring=%E4%E9%E1%EA%F1%E9%F3%2A%20and%202016. 372 Report of the Anti-discrimination Authority regarding the application of age criteria in sponsoring medical expenditure, File No. A.K.R. 93/2012, 5 June 2015, available at www.ombudsman.gov.cy/ombudsman/ombudsman.nsf/All/EA83B43532605E83C2257E7B001B6229/$file/% CE%91%CE%9A%CE%A193.2012-05.06.2015.doc?OpenElement. 373 Cyprus, Law on social insurance (\u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 2010) N. 59(I)/2010, articles 2 and 35, available at http://cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2010_1_59/index.html. 374 Cyprus, Law on pensions (\u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) N.97(I)/1997, article 9, available at www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/1997_1_97/full.html. 375 Cyprus, Law on pensions of state officials (General Principles) [O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd (\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03ad\u03c2) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ] N.88(I)/2011.

        "91 If an individual wish to work longer, payments from such occupational pension schemes can be deferred, if this is foreseen in the terms of the employee\u2019s pension scheme. In the private sector, an individual can collect a pension and still work. However, upon reaching retirement age, employees lose their right to compensation for unlawful dismissal. 377 Different private pension schemes provide different terms as regards the deferral of payments where a person wishes to work beyond retirement age. There is no law regulating these schemes and no generalisations can be made as regards common practice. c) State imposed mandatory retirement ages In Cyprus there is a mandatory retirement age set by law only for public sector employees. Different mandatory retirement ages apply for different employees in the public sector, depending on the profession, the rank and their year of joining the service. 378 A number of Supreme Court decisions since 2007 379 found that the different retirement age for employees of different ages does not amount to age discrimination. In the public sector, retirement ages are mandatory and employees may not work past their retirement limit. 380 Late retirement is prohibited by law for public employees, semi- governmental organisations employees and employees of public education institutions. d) Retirement ages imposed by employers In Cyprus national law does not prohibit the setting of retirement ages (or ages at which the termination of an employment contract is possible) in individual employment contracts or in collective agreements, There is no statutory retirement age in Cyprus for employees in the private sector. Up until now, the majority of private sector workers retired on their 65 th year, which is the pensionable age prescribed by the Social Insurance Law. 381 A person may choose to defer the payment of his or her pension until he or she reaches the age of 68, in which case the amount of the pension is increased by 0,5% for every month of deferral. 382 e) Employment rights applicable to all workers irrespective of age The Law on Termination of Employment provides that the right to protection from unfair dismissal is lost upon reaching pensionable age. 383 This effectively means that the employer is free to dismiss an employee or force him/her to retire at any time after he/she has reached pensionable age without having to pay any compensation.

        "92 Equality Body found the said provision discriminatory and referred it to the Attorney General for revision. However, no measures were taken and the said provision continues to remain in force. Under the current conditions of deep recession and rising youth unemployment, it is unlikely that this provision will be revised now. f) Compliance of national law with CJEU case law In Cyprus national legislation is not in line with the CJEU case law on age regarding compulsory retirement . Regarding the ruling in Wolf: 384 National legislation does not preclude legislative or other instruments which set a maximum limit for recruitment. Article 8(1) of Law 58(I)/2004 (transposing Directive 2000/78) sets out the general exception of article 6(1) of the directive, that differential treatment is permissible where the aim is legitimate and the means appropriate and necessary. Article 8(2) of Law 58(I)/2004 sets out the examples of the directive as to what may constitute permissible differential treatment. Although the list is not intended to be exhaustive, the focus is clearly on labour market policy and not on the need to have full physical capacity to perform the work. Besides, the Cypriot legislator chose to specify in the law only the armed forces as the profession where the exception applies. Thus, although it is possible to justify an age limit for recruitment for goals which relate to physical capacity and readiness rather than labour market polices, the appropriateness and necessity of the measure does not follow automatically, as it does in the case of labour market policies. In Cyprus, both the police force and the fire service have a maximum entry age of 28, unless the applicant is a University degree holder in which case the age limit is raised to 40. These particular provisions have not been tested by the Equality Body or the Courts. However, the Equality Body has rejected the age limit of 40 as a criterion for a promotion position in the police force, on the ground that the means to achieve the legitimate aim of physical capacity and readiness of the police force were not appropriate or necessary. 385 The Equality Body has also in the past repeatedly rejected the stereotype that younger persons are by definition healthier, fit and capable. Therefore, if these age limits are subjected to the Equality Body\u2019s scrutiny, it is possible that they may be deemed not to withstand the test of appropriateness and necessity. Regarding the ruling in Andersen: 386 There are no provisions in Cypriot law for a severance pay for employees who have worked for the same employer for many years. Employees who are unfairly dismissed are entitled to a compensation; in the private sector, this right is lost when the employee reaches retirement age (65 years). Employees who are lawfully dismissed are not entitled to any pay; this is up to the discretion of the employer and in practice is used only for highly placed managerial staff (known as \u2018the golden handshake\u2019). In the public sector, employees may be dismissed either for misconduct (in which case they receive no severance pay) or because of redundancy (in which case the employee is entitled to a redundancy pay from the government calculated by the number of years in service). 384 CJEU, C-229/08 Colin Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main, available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&num=C-229/08. 385 Cyprus, Equality Authority, Report No. A.K.I. 32/2008, 06 April 2012. 386 CJEU, Case No. C-499/08, Ingeni\u00f8rforeningen i Danmark, acting on behalf of Ole Andersen v Region Syddanmark, available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=78727&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode =lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=147363. ",
        "93 So although it is hard to envisage a situation like that of Andersen arising in Cyprus, it may be presumed that at least in the private sector the right to a severance pay may be lost upon reaching retirement age, in the same way that the right to compensation for unfair dismissal is lost. The Equality Body has already found that this provision is contrary to the directive and has asked for its revision but the provision remains in force more than a decade after this recommendation. Regarding the ruling in Mangold: 387 There are no national laws or practices for the conclusion of fixed term contracts once an employee reaches a certain age. Regarding the ruling in K\u00fcc\u00fcdevici: There are no national laws or practices for ignoring the period of employment completed by an employee before reaching 25 when calculating the notice period for dismissal. Regarding the ruling in Palacios de la Villa: 388 Compulsory retirement age is common in Cyprus both in collective agreements as well as in legislation regulating the retirement age in the public service and the wider public service. These measures do not explicitly state what the legitimate aim is that is being served by the retirement age. In those cases, where the Court was called upon to adjudicate on compulsory retirement age, the ruling was always that retirement age in general fell under the exceptions foreseen in the directive and was not subject to the Court\u2019s scrutiny. There is no law in Cyprus to regulate collective agreements; these are based on the principle of free bargaining. Regarding the ruling in The Incorporated Trustees of the National Council on Ageing: 389 As stated above, it is common for measures to provide for compulsory retirement without specifying the aim that is served. Clearly, in many of these cases, one may read that the (admittedly legitimate) aim of meeting social policy objectives is present, which can justify derogation from the non-discrimination principle. In other cases, the aim can, in addition to the social policy objectives, be the physical fitness of the service, which is not mentioned in the non-exhaustive list provided in the directive. However, the ruling in this case juxtaposed the social policy objective, which is deemed legitimate, with the personal aims of employers, which is not legitimate. In this context, the physical fitness of a service (such as the police force or the fire service) will fall in the former category, i.e. that of legitimate aims.

        "94 Collective agreements and legislative instruments can provide for compulsory retirement age which may not be expressly, directly or necessarily attributed to labour market policies; instead they may relate more to the physical capacity of the employee to carry out the tasks assigned to him/her. This ruling seems inclined to accept only the former as a legitimate aim, which would render the practice in Cyprus incompatible with this decision. On 16 February 2013 the Ministerial Cabinet approved a bill granting the right to the Minister of Labour to extend sectoral collective agreements and render them obligatory for the whole sector. The right to extend a collective agreement may be requested from the workers or the employers\u2019 unions or from the Ministry of Labour itself and the request will be examined by a Tripartite Committee. The bill endorses the claim of the workers\u2019 unions who believe that this regulation will help eliminate competition between workers and enterprises and combat the phenomenon of replacing workers covered by collective agreements with vulnerable workers (mainly from other EU countries) who are forced by their employers to work with inferior working conditions. There is however no provision in the bill as regards protection from discrimination. The Ministerial Cabinet approved the bill just days before the presidential elections which replaced the previous left-wing government with a new right wing government, whose cabinet members mainly originate from the employers\u2019 unions. A few weeks after the adoption of this bill, the collapse of the banking system and the haircut of bank deposits brought about the downfall of the economy; therefore, although this bill became law it was never implemented in practice. Regarding the ruling in Georgiev: 391 There are no measures in Cyprus that allow or provide for fixed term contracts to be concluded after a certain age. Such a measure has perhaps not been considered as necessary because employers in the private sector are in any case free to dismiss employees who reach retirement age without having to compensate them. In spite of this measure having been found by the Equality Body as not complying with the directive, the relevant law has not been modified. Regarding the ruling in Fuchs: 392 In Cyprus the retirement of public prosecutors is governed by the Pensions Law applicable to all civil servants, the provisions of which are in fact similar to the Law on the civil service of the Land Hessen in the Fuchs case. The new law which came into force on 01.01.2013 393 as part of the austerity package provides for extended compulsory retirement age for all civil servants. In article 3(1) the law states that it aims at the containment of public expenditure. Although under other circumstances this would be assessed as beneficial only for the employer and not in the public interest, at times of deep recession as currently experienced in Cyprus, this must be seen as a legitimate aim. No other aims or considerations are mentioned in the law and in fact the extension of the retirement age can hardly be seen as conducive to encouraging entry of young persons in the labour market. 391 CJEU Joined Cases C-250/09 and C-268/09, Vasil Ivanov Georgiev v Tehnicheski universitet - Sofia, filial Plovdiv, available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=83844&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mod e=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=149384. 392 CJEU, Gerhard Fuchs (C-159/10), Peter K\u00f6hler (C-160/10) v Land Hessen, available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=107924&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mod e=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=149632. 393 Cyprus, Law Abolishing and Replacing Retirement Benefits of Public Servants and Employees of the Wider Public Service including Local Government Authorities (Provisions of General Application) [ \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a9\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03ce\u03bd \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 (\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ] N.216(I)/2012.

        "95 Regarding the ruling in Prigge: 394 Labour traditions in Cyprus regard an earlier retirement age as an advantage, hence the negative reaction from the trade unions when the government proposed extending the retirement age in order to contain public spending. Having said that, it is possible in Cyprus to opt out of a collective agreement and enter a private agreement with the employer, but that is up to the employer to accept or not. In the event that there is a conflict between a national law and a collective agreement, the former prevails. The law fixing the retirement ages of public servants is stated to apply notwithstanding any provision to the contrary anywhere else. 395 4.7.5 Redundancy a) Age and seniority taken into account for redundancy selection In Cyprus national law does not permit or prohibit seniority or age to be taken into account in selecting workers for redundancy. The Termination of Employment Law which regulates redundancies does not provide for seniority or age to be taken into account in selecting workers for redundancy. However, there is extensive case law evidencing that the principle of \u201cfirst in- last out\u201d is accepted by the Courts and is used as a criterion for determining whether the right worker or workers have been selected for redundancy. In a significant number of cases, there is a collective agreement in force explicitly providing for this principle, which however must be used in conjunction with the ability and efficiency of a particular worker, in other words the provision in the collective agreement states that the person to be made redundant must be the last one appointed, having taken into account significant differences in the ability and efficiency of the work of the workers who are about to be dismissed. 396 All other things being equal, however, the Court will apply the principle of \u201cfirst in-last out\u201d 397 although in other instances the Court has ruled that seniority alone cannot prevent the selection of a worker for redundancy. 398 b) Age taken into account for redundancy compensation In Cyprus national law provides for compensation for redundancy. This is not directly affected by the age of the worker. The general rule of law is that the following criteria are used to determine the amount of compensation payable in the case of redundancy: the number of years of service in the same employer; 399 whether the period of employment was before 01 January 1964, as no compensation is payable for work before that date; 400 whether employment was 394 CJEU Case C-447/09, Reinhard Prigge and Others v Deutsche Lufthansa AG, available at http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=109381&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mod e=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=149820. 395 Cyprus, Law Abolishing and Replacing Retirement Benefits of Public Servants and Employees of the Wider Public Service including Local Government Authorities (Provisions of General Application) [ \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a9\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03ce\u03bd \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 (\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ] N.216(I)/2012.

        "96 continuous; 401 and the amount of weekly salary earned. 402 It may be argued that some of these criteria may, by inference, be indirectly related to age. Article 19(1) of the Termination of Employment Law provides that redundancy does not generate the right to compensation if the worker so dismissed was of retirement age on the date of termination of his/her employment. Also, in accordance with Article 19(2) of the same law, when a worker\u2019s employment is terminated within twelve months prior to his/her retirement age, the amount of compensation payable is reduced by one twelfth for every completed month of age during this 12-month period. 403 There are a number of cases decided by the Courts where age was used as a criterion in order to assess the worker\u2019s application for compensation from the redundancy fund where there was an offer by the employer for an alternative job position. In the case of a 58-year old stock-keeper who was made redundant but was offered by the same employer an alternative position as a door-to-door salesman, the Courts held that due to his advanced age he was right to reject that offer and was therefore entitled to compensation. 404 Similarly, a middle aged woman who was offered by her employer an alternative position at another location, which involved thirty minutes\u2019 walk from her residence, was held by the Courts as reasonable in rejecting it and was therefore entitled to compensation. 405 By contrast, a young woman who rejected her employer\u2019s offer for an alternative position which involved thirty minutes\u2019 walk from her residence to the workplace was held to have acted unreasonably because of her young age and good health and her application for redundancy compensation was rejected. 406 The same principle is applied where the employer introduces new or more advanced technology and requires the employee to accept training and/or adapt to the new methods: if the employee is young, his/her refusal to adapt to the new technology is held unreasonable and therefore redundancy compensation is not paid, whilst if the employee is old, the Court will afford more understanding to his/her inability or refusal to adapt and redundancy compensation is paid. 407 It is presumed that the same rule would be applied by the Courts in the case of employees with disabilities, although no such case has been brought before the Courts so far, bearing in mind that in cases of employees with disabilities the employer is obliged to provide \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 to enable the employee to adapt to the new technology. No cases have yet been presented before the Courts seeking to reverse the above rules on the basis of the anti-discrimination laws transposing the EU acquis and it is not clear whether or not these rules would withstand such a scrutiny. 4.8 Public security, public order, criminal offences, protection of health, protection of the rights and freedoms of others (Article 2(5), Directive 2000/78) 401 Cyprus, Law on termination of employment ( O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) \u039d. 24/1967, Table IV, Article 3.

Law N.59(I)/2004, which more or less transposes the Racial Equality Directive, renders non-discriminatory and therefore lawful any differential treatment or the introduction or maintaining of special measures which, although indirectly appearing as discriminatory, aim at preventing or compensating for disadvantages linked to ethnic or racial origin. 411 Along the same lines, Law 58(I)/2004, which more or less transposes the Employment Equality Directive, renders non-discriminatory and therefore lawful any preferential treatment in employment which, although prima facie discriminatory, aims at preventing or compensating for disadvantages due to racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age or sexual orientation. 412 The disability law renders non-discriminatory and therefore lawful any preferential treatment in occupation which although appearing prima facie discriminatory, aims at preventing or compensating for disadvantages due to disability. The same law provides that the principle of non-discrimination does not prevent the maintenance or introduction of regulations for the protection of health and safety at work or any measures aimed at promoting the labour market integration of persons with disability. 413 On 26 September 2002 the Supreme Court of Cyprus declared void and unconstitutional, a set of legal provisions granting priority to employment in the public sector to persons with disabilities 414 on a the basis of a quota system. The Court\u2019s reasoning was based on an interpretation of Article 28 of the Constitution that such priority discriminates against other candidates eligible for appointment in the public service. By the end of the following year, the Supreme Court had ruled that Law 87(I)/2004 (granting priority to war-disabled persons) was also unconstitutional, on the ground that it introduced a class of beneficiaries (the war-related disabled, etc.) that is favoured against others, thus reversing the principle of equality of all applicants before the law and violating Article 28 of the Constitution. 415 A 410 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000.

        "99 law granting priority in employment to blind telephonists 416 had strangely survived the wave of declaring all positive measures unconstitutional; however in 2009 the Equality Body found this law to be discriminating against persons with other disabilities and has asked for its revision. 417 When the Employment Equality Directive was transposed, the government and the parliament were initially reluctant to introduce quotas in employment for fear that these would be deemed to violate the non-discrimination principle set out in Article 28 of the Constitution, based on the CJEU decision in the Kalanke case. 418 In response to these concerns, in 2006 the Constitution was amended so as to give priority to EU regulations and directives over all domestic legislation (including the Constitution). However, several Court decisions which followed took little notice of this development and continued to apply the Constitution as if it was the supreme law of the country. The culture of positive action in order to offer opportunities to historically disadvantaged groups had hardly begun to develop, when Cyprus sank into an economic crisis and recruitments in the public service were frozen, as a measure to contain public expenditure. In 2009 an Equality Body decision has raised again the issue of the compatibility of positive action measures with the equality principle. The decision found that a law introducing quotas in employment for blind telephonists discriminates against persons with other disabilities and has asked for its revision. In February 2011 a new law came into force providing for an annual grant of \u20ac 3.675,48 to every family with a blind child. This is unlikely to be contested as incompatible with the equality principle, however, partly because different grants apply for different types of disability and partly, and more importantly, because grants especially as small as these are not seen as paramount as quotas in employment, a key issue for the disability movement. A law which came into force towards the end of 2009 introduced quotas in the employment of persons with disabilities in the wider public sector at 10 per cent of the number of the vacancies to be filled in at any given time, provided that this does not exceed seven per cent of the aggregate of employees per department. 419 Before it had the chance of being implemented, the austerity measures adopted in response to the economic crisis have led to the freezing of all new recruitments in the public sector. 420 The disability movement has however reported that disabled job applicants who applied for jobs invoking the provisions of this law were met with reluctance from public officials, who openly told them that the law is unconstitutional and will not remain in force for long. 421 In spite of these predictions, the quotas law was not declared unconstitutional and in 2015, the Court rejected an application from two non-disabled claimants who had sought to challenge the decision to appoint as teachers under the quotas law two persons with disability. The Court rejected the claimants\u2019 argument that the quotas were unconstitutional or that they violated the equality principle and disagreed with the claimants\u2019 submission that previous Supreme Court judgements had established that laws providing for quotas were unconstitutional. 416 Cyprus, Law Providing for the Hiring of Trained Blind Telephonists in the Public and the Educational Sector and in Public Bodies (Special Provisions) [ \u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03bb\u03ae\u03c8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03a4\u03c5\u03c6\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u03a4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 \u03a4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 (\u0395\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ] N. 17/1988.

        "100 The Court clarified that the equality principle as established in Article 28 of the Constitution safeguards against arbitrary differentiations but does not exclude reasonable ones which are allowed as a result of the essential nature of the circumstances. In such cases, the Court added, differential treatment of unequal or exceptional situations does not amount to a deviation from, but on the contrary to a practical implementation of, the equality principle; in this case the priority given to persons with disabilities was seen as falling within the boundaries of reasonable differentiation precisely for implementing equality. 422 b) Main positive action measures in place on national level Social Policy measures The Department of Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities under the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance offers several schemes for persons with disability. The schemes lay down general conditions of eligibility (e.g. severe kinetic disability) but are subject to approval from a special committee or a medical council, presided over by the Head of the Department for the Social Integration of Persons with Disabilities, that examines each individual application. The main schemes are: - A scheme of financial assistance in order to acquire technical devices covering 80% of the cost of such equipment, up to a maximum amount which is fixed at different levels from time to time. In exceptional circumstances of persons with very low income, 100% of the cost of the equipment applied for will be covered. The scheme does not cover the cost of prosthetic or orthotic members. 423 This scheme includes a wide range of equipment including closed circuit televisions, special reading screens for persons with visual disability, elevators, assistive equipment for walking and for bathing, ramps, conversion of cars in order to be driven by persons with kinetic disabilities, computers, special alarm clocks, multi-equipment for persons with hearing disability and special communication systems for persons with intellectual disability. Eligibility to this scheme does not depend on the type or degree of the disability; an applicant may apply more than once during the year for different technical or other assistive equipment. 424 Equipment that is returned to the Department of Social Integration for Persons with Disabilities under the above scheme may be offered to other persons with disability on loan, subject to approval from a special committee that examines each case on an ad hoc basis. Persons who take up such equipment on loan are also responsible for their maintenance. 425 - A scheme of a monthly cash payment of \u20ac 316,59 (to be adjusted periodically according to the cost of living) payable to Cypriots and other EU nationals with a severe kinetic disability aged between 12-65, subject to approval from a medical council. 426 422 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Costas Tsikas et al v.

        "101 - A monthly mobility allowance which varies according to the type of disability, mainly for students or persons in employment or occupation, to assist with the cost of transport to and from their place of work or education. For persons with severe kinetic problems at their feet, the sum paid is \u20ac 51 monthly; for blind persons \u20ac 102; for tetraplegic persons \u20ac 102 irrespective of whether they are working or studying. 427 - Scheme for the payment of a grant in order to acquire a wheelchair for persons with a severe problem in walking. The scheme funds four types of wheelchairs, budgeted between \u20ac 700 and \u20ac 13,500 depending on the needs of the applicants, as these needs are assessed by their physiotherapist. If a particular wheelchair is necessary the cost of which exceeds the maximum \u20ac 13.500, the scheme will pay only 50 % of the cost in excess of the \u20ac 13,500. 428 A scheme for providing wheelchairs to persons with disabilities on loan is also available. 429 - Tetraplegic persons with no movement in their upper and lower limbs are entitled to financial assistance of \u20ac 854,30 per month irrespective of income, to assist them with securing services of care and practical help in the home. Persons residing in a governmental institution where the cost of care services is covered by the state budget are excluded from this scheme. 430 A scheme of subsidising disability organisations and measures to assist with the labour integration of persons with disability, such as vocational training, supported employment, the provision of financial incentives for the creation and operation of small units for the self- employment of people with disabilities. 431 - Since 2011 a scheme for the provision of social escorts for adult persons with visual disability is operated by the Pan Cyprian Organisation of the Blind and funded by the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance. The scheme involves the hiring of persons for the purpose of escorting blind and blind/deaf persons to various public services (governmental and semi-governmental departments) and other venues such as banks, the post office, hospitals, law offices, shopping, conferences, cultural etc. to assist them in the carrying out of personal tasks for which vision is absolutely necessary. Escorts will also read and write the escorted person\u2019s personal correspondence, transcribe short texts, letters, articles etc., archive, and copy digital or audio texts or enlarged texts and will buy books, tape, CDs, memory cards and other audio-visual equipment and stationary. The beneficiaries of this service are persons whose vision in their best eye is lower than 6/60 with corrective lenses if such are used, including persons with additional disability (kinetic, psychosocial, psychological). The escort services are managed by the Pan Cyprian Organisation of the Blind whose officers assess each request separately and will act depending on the seriousness of each case. 432 \u039a\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ).

        "102 Quotas - A new law enacted in 2009 introduces quotas in the employment of persons with disabilities in the wider public sector at 10 per cent of the number of the vacancies to be filled in at any given time, provided that this does not exceed seven per cent of the aggregate of employees per department. The quota applies to first appointment positions (i.e. excluding promotions) at the introductory scale (i.e. low in hierarchy) and is specifically drafted to exclude areas where special provisions in favour of persons with disability are already in place (more specifically the quota in favour of blind telephonists- see below) and sections of the public service where \u201call physical, mental or intellectual restrictions must necessarily be absent\u201d 433 (the army, the police, the fire department and the prisons). As previously stated, this law is now essentially defunct, since recruitments to the public service are frozen as part of the austerity package intended to contain public spending. - The Appointment of Trained Blind Telephone Operators to the Post of Telephone Operator in the Public Sector (Special Provisions) Law of 1988 (L. 17/1988), Article 3, provides that blind candidates who have all the qualifications required by the scheme of service and who are trained telephone operators 434 are given priority in appointment. The same law also provides that for the appointment of a non-blind person to the post of telephone operator, the Pan Cyprian Organisation for the Blind must give its prior written confirmation that there are no blind telephone operators as candidates for the specific post. Article 3 of the same law also provides that in case there are no blind telephone operators as candidates for the said position, other candidates with disability will be preferred. These provisions have worked fairly well and have significantly contributed to the vocational rehabilitation and labour integration of blind persons, as the job of telephone operator continues to be the job of the majority of the blind persons in Cyprus. This law, which has resulted in the employment about 55 blind persons since its enactment in 1988, applies to telephone operators who have completed training at the School for Telephone Operators of the School of the Blind. It is considered by the Pan Cyprian Organisation of the Blind as a significant positive measure, despite the fact that it refers to a relatively low status type of work that may fall short of utilising the affected persons\u2019 full potential. Recent technological developments in telephone services may present a risk for this institution and could mean that training may have to be channelled in other directions. 435 Preferential treatment The following measures are in place in relation to certain groups of persons with disability: - Exemption from fees for medical purposes in public medical institutions; - Special parking tickets that secure preferential parking for persons with disability; - Exemption from certain charges concerning telecommunications and telephone services; - Preferential treatment is offered by semi-governmental organisations to all persons with disability: the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority offers reduced subscriptions for land lines; the Electricity Authority of Cyprus offers reduced electricity rates. 433 Cyprus, Law on the hiring of persons with disabilities in the wider public sector (special provisions) [\u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf \u03a4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03b1 (\u0395\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2] No. 146(I)/2009.

        "103 Roma and Minority rights based measures - There are no positive action measures in place for the Roma community or for any other community, except the provision of free housing in some cases and provisions related to the education of the Turkish-speaking children, consisting mainly of language classes, plus a small subsidy for school uniforms, the provision of meals at school and transport to and from the school. The aforesaid are not provided to this group in their capacity as Roma but in their capacity as \u2018Turkish speaking\u201d people; no special classes are offered on Roma history and culture. - A few measures are in place regarding the three constitutionally recognised \u2018religious groups\u2019: the Armenians, the Maronites and the Latins. The public broadcasting service CyBC (Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation) has for several years been airing radio programmes especially prepared for the Maronites, the Armenians and the Latins, albeit in Greek. There are however some measures in place to promote the use of the languages of the religious groups. As from October 2009, lessons in the Armenian language are being offered to the public by the Ministry of Education in evening classes. The most important measure however was the codification of Cypriot Maronite Arabic. On 9-10 November 2007, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education held a Symposium for the codification of the Cyprus-Maronite Arabic under the auspices of the Law Commissioner. For the first time in 2007 an alphabet was developed by an expert linguist and specialist in Cypriot Maronite Arabic based on the Latin alphabet and taking into account the specificities of the Cypriot Maronite Arabic language. This was launched by the Maronite community in December 2007. Following the codification, some news articles in Cypriot Maronite Arabic now appear in the Maronite periodicals. 436 In 2008 a Committee of Experts on Cypriot Maronite Arabic was set up to look into the codification of the Cypriot Maronite Arabic. A Cypriot Maronite Arabic revitalisation group was set up, which is composed of the team of experts, representatives of the Cypriot Maronite Arabic-speakers and a representative of the Ministry of Education and Culture who acts as a co-ordinator. In addition, the Council of Minsters has decided to formally set up a team of experts which will be responsible for drafting and implementing an action plan for Cypriot Maronite Arabic. 437 Other measures include the repair and maintenance of places of worship, cemeteries and schools, small grants for newspapers and other print media published by Maronites, Armenians and Latins and for the creation and upgrade of their websites, the funding of a monument in Larnaca to commemorate the Armenian Genocide, the funding of a documentary for the Latins of Cyprus, etc. 436 Report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in Cyprus, 23 September 2009. 437 The Report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in Cyprus of 23 September 2009 regrets the fact that the team of experts works without remuneration and the measures for the promotion of the newly codified language have been only partially funded by the government. The report pointed out that for the action plan to be implemented and the work of the team of experts and the revitalisation group to be carried out effectively in the long-run, more financial resources need to be allocated.

        "104 6 REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT 6.1 Judicial and/or administrative procedures (Article 7 Directive 2000/43, Article 9 Directive 2000/78) a) Available procedures for enforcing the principle of equal treatment In Cyprus the following three procedures exist for enforcing the principle of equal treatment: The Equality Body : Via the \u2018extra-judicial\u2019 process before the Equality Body whereby individuals and organisations may submit complaints which the Equality Body has a duty to investigate and issue decisions or recommendations. 438 Complaints may be submitted by natural or legal persons alleging discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds (EU directives, Protocol 12 to the ECHR, the Cyprus Constitution) in any of the fields within the scope of the laws. The Equality Body is empowered to issue binding decisions and/or make recommendations and impose small fines. The Equality Body also has a duty to monitor the enforcement of the orders it issues, 439 which are published in the Official Gazette. 440 The Equality Body is further empowered to impose fines for failure to comply with its recommendations, 441 which are however so low that they can hardly be seen as a deterrent. For this reason, it nearly always chooses to mediate or issue recommendations and has never so far imposed a fine, apart from once in a gender discrimination case, concerning a temporary worker who was dismissed from the public service whilst pregnant. 442 The decisions of the Equality Body may only be challenged in Court by way of judicial review of administrative action at the Supreme Court under article 146 of the Cyprus Constitution. 443 If after investigation the Equality Body finds that a certain law or regulation contravenes the anti-discrimination laws, the Equality Body will refer the discriminatory law or regulation to the Attorney General in order to draft an amendment. This procedure does not always bear fruit. Whilst the Equality Body\u2019s powers and mandate are exactly the same for claims against the public and the private sector, it receives very few complaints against the private sector. 438 S Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) Article 9G.

        "105 This is attributed by the officers of the Equality Body to the fact that the public is largely unaware of the existence and the powers of the Equality Body, often confusing it with the institution of the Ombudsman (whose competencies are restricted to the public sector), which has so far overshadowed the Equality Body. There are no time bars or other restrictions in applying to the Equality Body which is a rather flexible, informal and user friendly procedure (although a time bar of 12 months applies for submitting complaints to the Ombudsman). 444 The judicial process: - Labour law and issues relating to employment matters are dealt with by the Labour Tribunal. 445 The Labour Tribunal consists of three persons: a judge, who chairs the hearing and two wing members, who come from the side of the trade unions and the employers\u2019 organisations. The procedure in the tribunal is similar to a district court, but less formal. However, the labour tribunal decision of 2008 in the case of Hadjiavraam 446 rejected a claim for discrimination in the hiring procedure and found that it has no jurisdiction to try cases where no employment relationship exists. The legal vacuum which resulted from this decision was remedied in 2009 by an amendment of the law on Equal Treatment and Employment and Occupation (N.58(I)/2004) which transposes the Employment Equality Directive minus the disability component of the directive to the effect that all disputes arising under this law must be deemed as labour disputes. The disability law was not amended in the same manner as a result of which the legal gap created by the Hadjiavraam case remains in the case of disability: persons with disability have no competent Court to apply to for employment related claims where no employment relationship exists. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the finding of the trial court regarding jurisdiction but did not provide a specific finding as to the labour court\u2019s jurisdiction as regards the Law on Persons with Disability. 447 - Criminal law procedures are available in relation to discrimination related offences under the Penal Code. These procedures must be instigated by the police, although there is also in some cases the possibility of conducting a private criminal law case. - Law 59(I)/2004 (more or less transposing the Racial Equality Directive) provides in article 8(1) for resort to the District Court, for violation of the law\u2019s provisions. This is a civil procedure for the adjudication of compensation claims. - Rights guaranteed by the Constitution, such as the anti-discrimination provision of article 28, are according to legal precedent 448 actionable in Court per se against, inter alia, individuals. 444 Cyprus, Law amending and unifying the Laws on the Commissioner for Administration ( O\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 ) N. 3/91 as amended, Article 5(1)(a).

        "106 - All administrative acts can be challenged before the Supreme Court, via Article 146 of the Constitution. 449 Persons alleging discriminatory behaviour from public authorities may, under Article 146 of the Cyprus Constitution, 450 apply to the Supreme Court to set aside the act complained of. In practice, this is the procedure most often used by complainants, presumably because it is the one that most lawyers are familiar with. The person in whose favour a decision under 146 has been made may institute legal proceedings in a court for the recovery of damages or for being granted other remedy and to recover just and equitable damages to be assessed by the court. There is a number of restrictions in place as regards the judicial process: time bars; high fees and legal aid restrictions; security for costs; language barriers including issues relating to accessibility for persons with disabilities (e.g. blind, deaf and other persons); the issue of locus standi or legitimate interest; the immunity enjoyed by certain individuals under the Constitution such as elected and appointed state officers, diplomats, lawyers on issues relating to the conduct of cases they handle, etc.; and various country-specific structural problems that in practice undermine the right of access, such as the doctrine of necessity. The inspectorate process: The Minister of Labour is empowered to appoint Inspectors for the purpose of the better implementation of the law in terms of addressing employment discrimination issues. However, this process is yet to be implemented, as the regulations regarding the powers vested in the Chief inspector and inspectors are yet to be issued. It would seem reasonable to assume that the Labour Relations Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance would be the department in charge of implementing this provision, 451 given also that this department\u2019s mandate includes the setting up of enforcement mechanisms (Inspectors, Research and Evaluation Committee etc.) only in relation to gender equality. 452 Nevertheless, the department responsible for Laws N. 57(I)/2004 and 58(I)/2004 is the Department of Labour of the Ministry of Labour. The Minister has not yet utilised her powers to appoint inspectors. The Labour Inspection unit of the Ministry of Labour which deals with issues relating to health and safety at work has no mandate to investigate discrimination. 453 A special department within the Ministry of Labour, the Promotion of Equality at the Workplace, has a mandate to address gender discrimination. This body is nevertheless mandated also with the implementation of Law 58(I)/2004 roughly transposing the Employment Equality Directive 454 and can receive and investigate discrimination complaints on all six grounds minus disability, although no procedure or rules have been set as regards such investigation. Regulations are currently under preparation in order to set this unit into motion to examine discrimination complaints, which are almost identical to the regulations concerning gender discrimination. 455 The department is however understaffed and under- resourced and in light of the economic crisis the budgetary situation is likely to deteriorate 449 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment in employment and occupation (\u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u038a\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) 2004 N. 58(I)/2004, Article 12(1).

        "107 rather than improve. The inspectors currently appointed and working in the field (albeit now only for gender discrimination) are also tasked with other duties and do not have adequate time or resources to properly address the issue of gender discrimination, a problem likely to accentuate when their mandate is extended to cover four additional grounds. No record is kept by any agency as to how many discrimination cases are brought before the Courts. Only the Equality Body publishes annually data regarding the number of complaints received, the ground complained of, the outcome etc. The ombudsman\u2019s office also publishes statistics about complaints received and investigated in its capacity as ombudsman but it is not always clear from the data which of these complaints concern discrimination and which concern maladministration. The inadequate provision of legal aid, 456 the low awareness of the anti-discrimination laws among legal and judicial circles and the length of time required for litigation to be completed, renders the use of the judicial process very rare and accessible only to a privileged group amongst the vulnerable, usually civil servants alleging age discrimination in promotion or retirement. The judicial as well as the inspectorate process lead to binding decisions. The Equality Body has, by law, the power to issue legally binding decisions. However, in practice the decisions issued are usually mere recommendations because, in the opinion of the Equality Body, better results can be achieved through mediation. Such recommendations, although not legally binding, tend to be complied with at least by individuals. In some cases, the Equality Body is vested with the power to impose fines but this power has not been used yet for cases under the anti-discrimination directives. b) Barriers and other deterrents faced by litigants seeking redress Procedures before the Court are complex, costly and lengthy. Although in theory it is possible for litigants to litigate the case themselves and not engage the services of a lawyer, in practice there are very few persons able and willing to represent themselves in Court, given the complexity of the procedure. Migrants and the Roma community have little or no information as regards legal aid and no access to justice, hence the fact that they have never pursued a non-discrimination case in Court. Even for those who can afford a lawyer, one major obstacle is that there is hardly any specialisation in the market on discrimination law, which is a novel field that is not offered by any University and does not attract many clients. In those few cases examined by the Courts, counsel for the claimants hardly ever invoke the anti-discrimination laws, preferring to use the more familiar procedure of judicial review foreseen in the Constitution. The time bars are set out in paragraph (c) above. The Courts buildings are not accessible to persons with disability (visual, kinetic, hearing impairment etc.) nor are any court documents made available in Braille. Different time bars apply for different types of actions. 457 For civil offences and contracts, the time bar is six years. The Court has discretion not to apply the statute of limitation for 456 The Law on Provision of Legal Aid (2002) N. 165(I)/2002 provides for legal aid only for criminal and civil law cases: subject to a couple of exceptions, administrative recourses are excluded minus in cases concerning deportations or challenging asylum decisions, although a recent ECtHR decision found that \u201ca question arises as to the conformity of such legislation with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention\u201d and that \u201cthere is a priori no reason why it should not be made available in spheres other than criminal law\u201d (Marangos v. Cyprus, Application no. 12846/05, dated 04 December 2008). The legal aid law extends to human rights violations covered by the Constitution and by a number of international conventions including the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination, but not to the laws transposing the two anti-discrimination Directives. 457 Law on the Limitation Period for actionable rights ( O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03c2 \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03b3\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) N. 66(I)/2012.

        "108 two years where the claim is for bodily injury or death and the claimant was late in filing an action as a result of a delay in securing the necessary data or due to incapacity to handle the case. However, the time frame applicable to complainants who want to file a case in court is not suspended during examination of their complaint by the Equality Body, to enable a complainant to first apply to the Equality Body and then, if necessary, to Court to claim compensation without being time-barred. The time limits for lodging an appeal are strictly adhered to: 42 days from the date of the judgement for an appeal from the final determination; 14 for interlocutory injunctions; 75 days for an application to set aside an administrative decision under Article 146 of the Constitution. The Laws on the Commissioner for Administration which set out the mandate of the Ombudsman state that the complaint must be submitted to the ombudsman\u2019s office within twelve months from the date on which the complainant received notice of the activities or omissions for which he/she is applying to the Ombudsman. 458 There is no express provision on limitations as regards complaints to the Equality Body. Whether the employment relationship has ended or not at the time of submitting the complaint is immaterial, although the equality body, in the process of investigating a complaint, will take into account the surrounding circumstances of each case and whether the complainant has acted reasonably in respect of the timing of lodging his/her complaint. 459 The Court on the other hand is less likely to take the liberal approach adopted by the equality body and more likely to adopt a conservative approach; this was the case in the decision of the labour tribunal in the case of Hadjiavraam, where the labour tribunal rejected the claim because the labour tribunal\u2019s mandate covers only employment relations and not access to employment, as was the case with Hadjiavraam . 460 Upon appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s findings as regards jurisdiction by stating that the trial court failed to attribute due weight to the fact that the court is mentioned in Law 58(I)/2004 as the competent court to try the case. No mention was made to the fact that Law 58(I)/2004 ranks more highly than national laws because it transposes the acquis. 461 c) Number of discrimination cases brought to justice In Cyprus there are no statistics are maintained on the number of cases related to discrimination brought to justice. There are no estimates of the number of discrimination cases brought to justice in any journals or textbooks. d) Registration of discrimination cases by national courts In Cyprus discrimination cases are not registered as such by national courts. Courts maintain registers of cases tried, which are partly accessible to the public through a rather bureaucratic and discretionary procedure which involves writing letters to the Courts Registrar. The Court\u2019s archive is not organised by subject but only by reference number or names of the parties, which makes a search impossible unless one already has the coordinates of the judgement. In recent years, two electronic data bases have been compiled, containing all court decisions, which can be searched through key words.

        "109 6.2 Legal standing and associations (Article 7(2) Directive 2000/43, Article 9(2) Directive 2000/78) a) Engaging on behalf of victims of discrimination (representing them) In Cyprus organisations are entitled to act on behalf of victims of discrimination under conditions. Organisations with a legitimate interest in the implementation of the anti-discrimination laws may exercise the rights of a claimant in the proceedings. 462 Although no special definition of the claimant is provided, to the extent that a person or company or an organisation can act as a claimant, then such claimant may be represented by the organisation with the legitimate interest. b) Engaging in support of victims of discrimination In Cyprus organisations are entitled to act in support of victims of discrimination. 463 The anti-discrimination laws do not go into any lengths to describe the type of entities that may act on behalf or in support of victims; they merely provide that organisations with a legitimate interest and with the victim\u2019s permission can represent a victim of discrimination in proceedings both before the Equality Body and before the Court. It is presumed that such organisations must at the very least be registered, or else they lack legal personality and legal capacity. The presumption is reinforced by the fact that Law 59(I)/2004 (roughly transposing the Racial Equality Directive), article 12, requires that in order for organisations or other legal persons to be able to represent and act on behalf of persons in applying to the courts or the Equality Body, such organisations must (in addition to the victim\u2019s permission) have a provision in their memorandum and articles of association that the elimination of discrimination on the ground of racial or ethnic origin is part of their aims. The Equality Body may investigate cases following applications by NGOs, chambers, organisations, committees, associations, clubs, foundations, trade unions, funds and councils acting for the benefit of professions or other types of labour, employers, employees or any other organised group, local authorities, public law persons, the Council of Ministers, the House of Parliament etc. 464 Article 14 of Law 58(I)/2004 which roughly transposes the Employment Equality Directive provides that workers\u2019 organisations or other organisations with a legitimate interest can act on behalf of their members with the members\u2019 permission in claiming their right to resort to the Courts or to the Equality Body. Similarly, article 9D of the disability Law N. 127(I)/2007 as amended by Law 57(I)/2004, provides that workers\u2019 organisations or other organisations with a legitimate interest can, with their members\u2019 permission, exercise on their behalf the right to recourse to the courts or to the Equality Body. No other \u2018legitimate interest\u2019 is required under this law.

        "110 (59(I)/2004), article 12, requires that organisations must have both the victim\u2019s permission and a provision in their memorandum and articles of association that the elimination of discrimination on the ground of racial or ethnic origin is part of their aims. No distinction is made between the two types of standing (on behalf/in support). There are no membership or permanency or other requirements in the law. Associations have made little use of this opportunity so far, with only a handful of NGOs filing complaints to the Equality Body on behalf of victims which they formally or informally represent. The Equality Body follows a flexible approach and does not demand to see permission from the victim or copies of articles of association in order to ensure that the law\u2019s requirements are met before investigation begins. No case involving an organisation acting in support of or on behalf of a victim has ever been presented in Court, so it is hard to say how the Court will interpret the term \u2018organisation\u2019 and whether any required features will be attached to the concept. The Equality Body which has examined a number of complaints from organisations does not impose any restrictions and has no requirements; for instance, it has investigated complaints from organisations acting on behalf of a group of persons, which do not have to be named specifically (e.g. \u2018asylum seekers\u2019, \u2018children with disabilities\u2019 etc.). However, this liberal approach is not indicative of the stand which the Courts are likely to take when hearing such a case. With regard to legitimate interest, again the Equality Body raises no such issues but the Courts do in a substantive way. In three different cases, the Court rejected the applicants\u2019 claim for, inter alia, lack of legitimate interest: in two cases the claim concerned an athletic award for disabled athletes which was lower than that of other athletes, where the claimant had not at the time of filing the application become entitled to it; 465 and in the third case the applicant was deemed to lack a legitimate interest since there was no positive legislative provision entitling her to claim the right of extending a regulation on the age of retirement so as to include her age group. 466 In general, individuals who have been personally aggrieved, have a legitimate interest in Cypriot administrative law to engage in proceedings. Under Article 146(2) of the Constitution: \u201csuch recourse may be made by a person whose existing legitimate interest, which he has either as a person, or by virtue of being a member of a community, is adversely and directly affected by such decision or omission\u201d. Since 1999 the common law provisions have been codified into a single law that summarises the existing practice (Law 158(I)/99). The interpretation of Article 146(2) of the Constitution by the Supreme Court has restricted the right of recourse to physical and legal persons who have been adversely and directly affected and have a legitimate interest. Representatives were not considered to have legitimate interest and the term \u201ccommunity\u201d is defined as meaning the Greek and Turkish communities, as defined in Article 2 of the constitution. The original test for an association to possess an \u201cexisting legitimate interest\u201d was hard to satisfy, as it required that the specific administrative act \u2018 directly affects\u2019 the whole or part of the membership, whereas if it only affects one member or if there are conflicting interests between members then the association has no legitimate interest. 467 465 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Antonis Aresti v.

        "111 c) Actio popularis In Cyprus national law does not explicitly allow associations, organisations or trade unions to act in the public interest on their own behalf, without a specific victim to support or represent. In the absence of an express provision it is unlikely that the Courts will accept such an action, given that in the past they did reject claims because the law did not expressly provide for the right sought by the applicant. 468 The Equality Body does accept and investigate complaints from associations (e.g. the RAXEN National Focal Point, the confederation of disability organisations KYSOA, anti-racist NGOs, the Social Welfare Committee of the Parliament of the Elderly) acting in the public interest on their own behalf without a specific victim to support (e.g. \u2018Roma pupils\u2019 in general or \u2018female migrant workers\u2019 in general, \u2018persons with disability\u2019, \u2018migrants\u2019, \u2018drivers aged over 70\u2019 respectively, etc.). This should however be attributed to the liberal approach followed by the Equality Body rather than an interpretation of the law allowing actio popularis . d) Class action In Cyprus national law does not explicitly allow organisations to act in the interest of more than one individual victim ( class action ) for claims arising from the same event. The Courts of Justice Law, which regulates the mandate of all courts in Cyprus, regulates the powers of the court to adjudicate claims, award compensation or other remedy, issue orders and recognise rights, whether a remedy is being requested or not. 469 There has never been a legal precedent on class actions and it is therefore impossible to conclude whether, in the absence of a special legislative provision, such will be accepted by the courts. The laws transposing the Anti-discrimination directives are silent on the possibility of organisations representing more than one complainants at the same time but do not expressly prohibit this either. Law No. 58(I)/2004 transposing roughly the Employment Equality Directive states, in Article 14, that organisations may, with their members\u2019 permission, exercise the right to apply to the Courts or to the Equality Body on behalf of their members. The plural is used when referring to \u2018members\u2019 but it is not clear whether this enables class actions to be taken out by organisations in their members\u2019 names. The equivalent provision in Law 59(I)/2004 uses the singular when referring to the member to be represented (article 12). The Civil Procedure Rules make provision for joinder of actions but only when these refer to the same subject-matter. In particular, the rules provide that all persons may be joined in a single action as claimants for remedies arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions, whether jointly, severally or in the alternative, unless such joinder would embarrass or delay the trial. Also, where there are numerous persons having the same interest in one cause, one or more of such persons may be authorized by the Court to sue or defend on behalf or for the benefit of all persons so interested; organisations which are unincorporated or operating for profit are excluded. 470 The Equality Body does accept and investigate complaints from associations acting in the interest of more than one victim. 468 In Eleni Kyriakidou v Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (Supreme Court case no. 18/2008, dated 03 December 2010) the Supreme Court found the applicant lacked legitimate interest because there was no express legislative provision giving her the right she was seeking to enforce through the Courts.

        "112 6.3 Burden of proof (Article 8 Directive 2000/43, Article 10 Directive 2000/78) In Cyprus national law permits a shift of the burden of proof from the complainant to the respondent. 471 However, the courts have never so far been faced with a claim for the reversal of the burden of proof and there is no judicial precedent on how this will be applied. The Equality Body does not reverse the burden of proof; however, since it has the power to carry out its own investigations to establish the facts of a case, the procedure may be said to fall within the exception of Article 8(5) of the Racial Equality Directive and therefore reversal of the burden of proof is not required. Provisions for shifting the burden of proof to the employer once a prima facie case of dismissal is established can also be found in Cypriot labour law. The Termination of Employment Law 1967, as amended, is phrased in such a way that imposes the burden of proof on the employer, i.e. the employer has to prove that an employee had been dismissed for one of the reasons that permit summary dismissal. If the alleged unreasonableness, resulting in dismissal, is based on discrimination, the burden of proof is on the employer to prove, on the balance of probabilities that s/he had acted reasonably. 6.4 Victimisation (Article 9 Directive 2000/43, Article 11 Directive 2000/78) In Cyprus there are legal measures for protection against victimisation. Identical provisions against victimisation are to be found in all three laws enacted to transpose the directives. 472 The victimisation provisions are not restricted to the employment field. The Law on Equal Treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic N.58(I)/2004, which includes protection against victimisation, 473 covers the fields of social protection, health care, education, social provision and access to goods and services. The protection against victimisation in the disability law is not restricted to the employment field 474 and by implication extends to the entire scope of this law. The said provisions prohibit any adverse treatment or consequence towards any person who files a complaint or is involved in a procedure aiming at implementing the principle of equal treatment. Therefore, any person involved in the procedure in a capacity other than as a complainant (e.g. as a witness or as a lawyer or as a person helping a victim to present a complaint) is also covered by the protection against victimisation. The Laws on the Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) provide a more detailed description of the scope of the protection against victimisation: \u2018Anyone who refuses to employ, dismisses or threatens to dismiss from work, influences or threatens to influence, frightens or forces any other person or imposes any monetary or other punishment to any other person because such person has (i) submitted or intends to submit a complaint to be investigated by the Ombudsman; (ii) has supplied or presented or intends to supply or 471 Cyprus, Law on persons with disabilities ( \u039f \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) No. 127(\u0399)/2000) article 9A.

It is not necessary for the victim to have actually assisted in the investigation of a complaint against the employer; it is sufficient to prove that the employer treated him/her unfairly believing or suspecting that s/he did so or was intending to do so. 477 A decision of the Equality Body in 2015 extended the principle of discrimination of a primary carer by association with a person with a disability to situations of victimisation. 478 The legal framework against victimisation is not being utilised in order to put an end to the practice of the authorities of arresting and deporting migrant female domestic workers who file complaints against their employers. 479 6.5 Sanctions and remedies (Article 15 Directive 2000/43, Article 17 Directive 2000/78) a) Applicable sanctions in cases of discrimination \u2013 in law and in practice The Equality Body does not have the power to award damages to victims of discrimination. Strictly speaking, the Court may award all types of damages available in civil procedures, like pecuniary, nominal or punitive damages; however, very few discrimination claims have been tried by the Courts in Cyprus and damages were awarded only to one of these cases, 480 which does not allow for any conclusions to be drawn with regard to judicial practice. Punitive damages are very rarely awarded and, generally speaking, the amounts awarded by the Cypriot Courts tend to be rather low compared to the damages awarded in other countries. In addition to or in lieu of damages, a victim of discrimination may apply to the Labour Disputes Tribunal seeking reinstatement to a position from which s/he was unlawfully dismissed, but this is a remedy rarely sought or used. 475 Approximate Euro equivalent: 520 Euros. 476 Laws on the Commissioner for Administration ( \u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 ) N. 3/1991, Article 11(f).

        "114 Law 42(I)/2004 vests the Equality Body with powers beyond those prescribed by the two EU directives: the power to receive and investigate complaints of discriminatory treatment, behaviour, regulation, condition, criterion or practice prohibited by law; the power to issue reports of findings; the power to issue orders (through publication in the Official Gazette) for the elimination, within a specified time limit not exceeding 90 days from publication in the official Gazette 481 and in a specified way, of the situation which directly produced discrimination, although such right is somewhat limited by a number of exceptions: - where the act complained of is pursuant to another law or regulation, in which case the Equality Body advises the Attorney General accordingly, who will advise the competent Ministry and/or the Council of Ministers about measures to be taken to remedy the situation; 482 - where discrimination did not occur exclusively as a result of violation of the relevant law; - where there is no practical direct way of eradicating the situation or where such eradication would adversely affect third parties; - where the eradication cannot take place without violating contractual obligations of persons of private or public law; - where the complainant does not wish for an order to be issued; or - where the situation complained of no longer subsists. 483 The Equality Body is further empowered to impose small fines which cannot exceed CYP350 (Euros 598) for discriminatory behaviour, treatment or practice; CYP250 (Euros 427) for racial discrimination in the enjoyment of a right or freedom; CYP350 (Euros 598) for non- compliance with the recommendation within the specified time limit; and CYP50 (Euros 85.44) daily for continuing non-compliance after the deadline set by the Equality Body. 484 Generally speaking, the fines are very low; they offer little deterrence to potential perpetrators and they never imposed by the Equality Body. The Equality Body may also issue recommendations to the person against whom a complaint has been lodged and to supervise compliance with orders issued against persons found guilty of discrimination. 485 It is possible for the Equality Body to recommend school desegregation plans or the instigation of disciplinary proceedings against teachers or other persons guilty of discrimination; in practice, however, the Equality Body\u2019s recommendations generally do not propose measures as drastic as that and there is a clear tendency towards \u2018diplomacy\u2019 and mediation, evidenced by the fact that no binding decisions have been issued so far and no fines have been imposed.

        "115 \u2018vested interest\u2019. 487 There is no requirement for special measures to be adopted in order to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the Equality Body. In addition to the right to investigate complaints submitted by individuals or organisations, the Equality Body may also investigate issues on its own right where it deems that any particular case that came to its attention may constitute a violation of the law. 488 The Equality Body is empowered to issue recommendations to the person or group found guilty of discriminatory behaviour as to alternative treatment or conduct, abolition or substitution of the provision, term, criterion or practice. In fact, all cases investigated by the Equality Body until now have led to recommendations , as opposed to binding decisions . The recommendations have often taken the form of suggesting to the authorities or to the private sector to revise their practices over specific issues. Reports issued by the Equality Body have, for instance, recommended to insurance companies to revise their practice of refusing to insure persons of Pontian Greek origin; to employers to remove the maximum age limit fixed for advertised jobs; to the public nursing school to revise its entry requirements so as not to exclude persons with disabilities; to the immigration authorities to remove from the standard contract of employment of migrant workers a clause prohibiting them from joining trade unions; to insurance companies to revise their policy of not insuring persons over 70 to drive cars or of charging a higher premium for it, etc. The recommendations of the Equality Body tend to be complied with by both the private and the public sector, even though in many cases they come with 3-4 years of delay, in which case compliance is impossible because third party rights were meanwhile created or because compliance would no longer make sense. The immigration authorities are a notable exception to the rule: although many of the recommendations of the Equality Body/Ombudsman are directed against this body, compliance is very rare whilst letters, warnings and notices are ignored, as often noted by the Equality Body. The findings and reports of the Equality Body must be communicated to the Attorney General who will, in turn advise on the adoption or not of appropriate legislative or administrative measures, taking into account the state\u2019s international law obligations and who will at the same time prepare legislation for the abolition or substitution of the relevant legislative provision. The findings of the Equality Body are also communicated to the House of the Representatives. Under Law N.59 (I)/2004 transposing (roughly) the Racial Equality Directive, the competent courts for discrimination cases at first instance are the District Courts. 489 The same law also provides for the complainant\u2019s right to lodge a complaint to the Equality Body. 490 Furthermore, persons alleging discriminatory behaviour from public authorities may, under Article 146 of the Cyprus Constitution, 491 appeal to the Supreme Court of Cyprus for an order to set aside the administrative decision complained of. This procedure however has a number of disadvantages compared to the laws transposing the directives: it applies only to the public sector, it does not reverse the burden of proof and can have only an annulling effect on the administrative act complained of. Under Law N.58 (I)/2004 transposing the Employment Equality Directive (minus the disability component), the competent court to try discrimination cases at first instance is the Labour Disputes Tribunal. 487 Term used in Section 146 of the Cyprus Constitution, which sets out the procedure for judicial review of an administrative act. 488 Cyprus, The Combating of Racial and Some Other Forms of Discrimination (Commissioner) Law [ O \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ce\u03bd \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (\u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2] No. 42(I)/ 2004, Article 33.

        "116 The legal vacuum which had been created in 2008 by the decision in the case of Hadjiavraam was remedied in 2009 for all grounds except disability, by an amendment of the law, which now provides that all disputes arising under this law must be deemed as labour disputes. Under law 59(I)/2004 (transposing the Race Directive minus the employment component) the penalty to be imposed by the Court against a physical person found to be guilty, is a maximum of CYP4.000 (Euros 6,835.27) and/or imprisonment of up to six months. For legal persons the maximum penalty is CYP7.000 (Euros 1,196.72). An offence committed under the same law out of gross negligence carries a penalty of up to CYP2000 for physical persons. If the offence has been committed out gross negligence, the fine for physical persons is up to CYP2.000 (Euro 3,417.63); for legal persons, there is a fine of up to CYP2.000 (Euro 3,417.63) for the managing director, chairman, director, secretary or other officer if it can be proven that the offence was committed with his/her consent plus an additional fine of up to CYP4.000 (Euro 6,835.27) for the company or organisation. 492 Under law 58(I)/2004 (transposing the Employment Equality Directive) the penalties are identical to those provided for the law transposing the Racial Equality Directive. 493 Same applies to procedures and penalties under the disability law. 494 No such fines have been imposed by the Courts so far. There are also penal remedies against discrimination. With the adoption of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as well as with the subsequent amendments (Law 11(III)/92 and Law 28(III)/99), Cyprus established, in conformity with a recommendation of the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a number of offences relevant to combating racism and intolerance, such as incitement to racial hatred, participation in organisations promoting racial discrimination, public expression of racially insulting ideas and discriminatory refusal to provide goods and services. The scope of this latter provision 495 is stated to extend to goods or services supplied by a person in the course of his/her profession, but it is not defined any further and may thus be presumed to apply to, inter alia, health, education and training. As a result of these amendments, it is no longer necessary that the incitement to racial hatred is intentional for the corresponding offence to be committed; in addition, for the refusal to provide goods and services to constitute an offence, it is no longer necessary that race be the sole ground of discrimination. 496 The Criminal Code (Cap.154) Article 51A provides that whoever publicly and in any way \u201cprocures the inhabitants to acts of violence against each other or to mutual discord or foments the creation of a spirit of intolerance is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment of up to twelve months or to a fine. 497 492 Cyprus, Law on equal treatment (racial or ethnic origin) [ \u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0399\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 (\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae) \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) N. 59(I)/2004, Article 13.

        "117 The law ratifying the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime concerning the Criminalisation of Acts of Racist or Xenophobic Nature committed through Computer Systems 498 also creates a number of criminal offences, each of which is punishable with a prison sentence of up to five years and/or a fine of up to CYP20,000 (Euros 34,176.35): - Article 4 criminalises the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through a computer system; - Article 5 criminalises racially and xenophobicly motivated threat disseminated through a computer system; - Article 6 criminalises racist and xenophobicly motivated insult; - Article 7 of criminalises the denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity; - Article 8 criminalises the aiding and abetting of any of the crimes provided for in Articles 4-7 of the law. There are no distinctions as to sanctions in the private and the public domain, at least in the legislation, nor does the law make any differentiation as to the sanctions within and beyond employment. Under Law N.134(I)/2011 which transposes the Framework Decision on Combating Hate Crimes through Criminal Law, a person who wilfully and publicly disseminates and publicly incites violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin, in a manner that disturbs public order or which is of a threatening, abusive or insulting character, is guilty of an offence and if convicted is subject to a penalty of imprisonment not exceeding five (5) years or to a fine not exceeding ten thousand euro (\u20ac 10,000) or to both such sentences. Same sanctions apply for other offences created by this law such as the approval or denial or gross downplaying of crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 499 b) Ceiling and amount of compensation In Cyprus there is no ceiling on the maximum amount of compensation that can be awarded, but in general, compensations awarded by Cypriot Courts tend to be very low compared to compensations awarded by other national Courts. With just one Court decision awarding damages in over ten years, 500 since the directives were transposed, it is not possible to draw conclusions on judicial trends as regards the amounts of compensation awarded. c) Assessment of the sanctions The Equality Body is not entitled to award compensation.

        "118 was not awarded compensation at first instance, as the Labour Disputes Tribunal claimed lack of jurisdiction. The tribunal nevertheless proceeded to give its reasoning on the merits of the case. On the issue of measurement of compensation, the tribunal found that the sum of 1,500 Euros would be appropriate as this represents three salaries which would have been paid to the applicant had she been hired. In order to arrive at this conclusion, the tribunal relied on the CJEU decision in the Case C-180/95 Draehmpaehl [1997] ECR I- 2195 which established that three salaries are sufficient to satisfy the three preconditions which the amount of compensation awarded must satisfy (essential protection, deterrent and proportional to the damage) in those cases where the job candidate would not have been hired even in the absence of age discrimination. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court endorsed the tribunal\u2019s measurement of compensation and awarded the appellant the equivalent of three months\u2019 salaries amounting to a total of \u20ac 1,500 because, as it had established, the applicant would not have been hired to this post even in the absence of the age discrimination in the advert. 501 In the absence of a body of case law on discrimination and awards of damages where discrimination was the operative factor, it is not possible to make a final assessment as to whether or not the sanctions are adequate, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The law does not provide for \u2018punitive damages\u2019 to be paid by the perpetrator to the victim to act as (a) disincentive for offenders and (b) incentive for victims to complain (and in particular as incentive for lawyers to specialise). It is safe to state, however, that the sanctions which the Equality Body is allowed to levy are too low to have any dissuasive effect; the main incentive for compliance with Equality Body decisions remains public image. 501 Cyprus, Appeal Court, Avgoustina Hajiavraam v.

Although the mandate of the Equality Body extends beyond the minimum required by the Racial Equality Directive, it lacks the power to represent victims in Court or otherwise provide independent assistance. 502 Two separate departments are set up within the Equality Body: the \u2018Equality Authority\u2019 and the \u2018Anti-discrimination authority\u2019, dealing respectively with employment issues and with fields beyond employment and in practice constitute the national anti-discrimination body according to the Racial Equality Directive.

Currently the same office carries out the following additional functions: Ombudsman, National Human Rights Institute (NHRI), Independent Authority for the Prevention of Torture under the relevant Convention, Independent Mechanism for the monitoring of the implementation of the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disability, Monitoring Body for the implementation of the Return Directive. No additional budget has ever been allocated to this office every time its mandate was extended to include a new function. In its latest report on Cyprus, ECRI expressed concern over the fact that the Equality Body/Ombudsman lacks sufficient human and financial resources, does not enjoy the freedom to appoint its own staff and is not well known to vulnerable groups. 503 Due to its serious understaffing problem, which is highlighted in several national and international reports, 504 discrimination complaints take three or more years to be examined, essentially leaving the complainant without a remedy, as in the meantime third party rights are often created whilst the complainant will be time- barred from seeking redress through the courts.

        "120 victims. Its power to impose fines is so restricted that it exclusively resorts to mediation rather than to issuing binding decisions. In 2014 the law regulating the Ombudsman\u2019s mandate was amended to provide for the powers of the Ombudsman to carry out consultations for the implementation of his or her recommendations and, in the event that the competent authority does not respond or fails to adopt the recommendations within the deadline set for reasons which the Ombudsman finds unjustified, to submit the result of the consultations to the Council of Ministers and the Parliament. 505 The law further enables the Ombudsman to publicise the refusal or failure of the competent authority to comply with the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations and to bring such refusal or failure to the attention of the minister in charge, who must take measures to ensure the cooperation of the competent authority with the work of the Ombudsman. Under the new law, the refusal of any state officer to co-operate with the Ombudsman when required is a disciplinary offence, whilst the fines and term of imprisonment foreseen for persons failing to cooperate with the Ombudsman or victimising a person who has submitted a complaint or supplied information to the Ombudsman are increased from CY\u00a3 300 to \u20ac 5,000 and from six months to one year respectively. 506 By far the cheapest and most effective procedure is the complaint to the Equality Body. All court actions entail costs and other necessities such as the need to instruct a lawyer if one is to have any chance to succeed against a generally speaking more powerful institution or employer, who are likely to be legally represented. There are also other deterrents in seeking redress in Court, such as strict time limits and complex procedures, the fact that legal procedures are generally slow, the difficulty in securing witnesses willing to testify. Even the procedure before the Labour tribunals, originally designed to be informal and easy and accessible to ordinary working people is lengthy, complex and costly, although to a lesser extent than the other courts. The Equality Body will accept complaints submitted to it in English. The Court will require all documents to be in Greek, although during the hearing an interpreter will be provided by the Court. However, in a case before the Supreme Court, the court accepted the pleadings submitted by the Turkish Cypriot applicants in the Turkish language and instructed the Attorney General to serve pleadings to the applicants in Turkish. The same rules apply in both the private and the public sector. The Ombudsman, in his/her capacity as such, will investigate complaints of maladministration and discrimination from public bodies/state organs towards individuals; in his/her capacity as the national Equality Body, s/he will investigate complaints in both the private as well as the public sector. The Ombudsman is appointed by the President of the Republic for a fixed term of office which is six years, following a recommendation from the Council of Ministers and with the prior written agreement of the majority of the House of Parliament. 507 The Ombudsman can only be dismissed, during the term of his/her service, in the same way as Supreme Court judges are dismissed. 508 According to the Cypriot Constitution, a Supreme Court judge is appointed as a permanent member of the judicial service until he/she reaches the age of sixty-eight 509 and may only \u201cbe retired\u201d 510 due to such mental or physical incapacity 505 Although the Ombudsman is also the national Equality Body, this particular law amends the mandate of the Ombudsman only. 506 Cyprus, Law amending the Law on the Commissioner for Administration 1991-2011 ( \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u03af \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1991 \u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 2011 ) \u039d.45(\u0399)/2014, 11 April 2014.

The Equality Body does not have its own budget; it is operating within the budget of the Ombudsman, with whom the Equality Body shares office premises, personnel and the person at the top of the hierarchy, which is the same for both bodies. The figures in the table below represent the budget for all functions under the Ombudsman\u2019s office and not only for the Equality Body. The slight increase in the budget from year to year covers only the index-linked salary and other cost increases and does not allow for the hiring of additional personnel or the carrying out of any additional activities. Occasionally, the Ombudsman (in his/her capacity as Equality Body) applies for and is awarded EU funds for particular projects, such as the two opinion surveys it carried out in 2007, the code of conduct on disability discrimination and the guidelines for the media it published in 2010. The Ombudsman is an independent officer and is not answerable to any other body, although it is required to submit an annual Activity Report to the President of the Republic and to the House of Representatives. Staffing and budgeting arrangements Below are the budgeting and staffing arrangements of the Equality Body annually since its inception. It should be noted that the staff and budget shown are not exclusively devoted to the Equality Body: with the same staff and budget a number of other authorities operate from within the same office (Ombudsman, NHRI, Independent Authority for the Prevention of Torture, Monitoring Body for the implementation of the Return Directive, Monitoring Body for the implementation of the CRPD) in a manner that makes any allocation of staff and budget to any particular authority impossible. The multiple mandates and insufficient resources have led to long delays in examining complaints, often leaving victims without an effective redress because third party rights are meanwhile created and the limitation period to apply to the court has expired. The statistical data does not allow conclusions as to whether one particular mandate receives more attention than the other, but very often victims submit complaints without specifying which of the authorities they are addressing and it is up to the Ombudsman to decide which authority will handle each complaint.

The law governing the duties and powers of the Ombudsman (customarily referred to in Cyprus as \u201cCommissioner of Administration\u201d) 512 provides that the Ombudsman is not allowed to hold any other office or carry out any other work with remuneration. 513 Article 4(2) of the same law provides that the members of staff of the Ombudsman\u2019s office are civil servants, to be appointed in accordance with the Law on Civil Service. Although since its inception there was never an issue as regards the independence and impartiality of the members of staff working at the Ombudsman/Equality Body, the fact that the body lacks the power to choose its own members of staff is generating discontent amongst the body itself 514 and has also attracted criticisms from ECRI 515 and from the Advisory Committee for the FCNM. 516 Another issue potentially affecting its independence is the fact that its infrastructure budget is exclusively provided by the Ministry of Finance; but perhaps the most crucial factor of all as regards the institution\u2019s independence is the fact that the Ombudsman (and Head of Equality Body) is appointed by the President of the Republic and must be acceptable to the majority of the political forces. During 2011, when the term of the former ombudsman expired and a new ombudsman had to be appointed, the body remained headless for several months until the political forces would agree on the person to be appointed. c) Grounds covered by the designated body/bodies The grounds which the Equality Body has a mandate to deal with are: Race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs, ethnic or national origin (which is equated with nationality), special needs, age, sexual orientation, national origin, all rights guaranteed in ECHR and all its protocols (including article 1(1) of Protocol 12 to the ECHR), in the International Convention for the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination, in the Convention against Torture and other Forms of Inhumane or Humiliating Treatment, in the 512 Although the Ombudsman is also the Equality Body, the reference here is to the Ombudsman only. 513 Laws on the Commissioner for Administration ( \u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 ) N. 3/1991, Article 3(3).

In practice, it also deals with gender, gender identity, community as well as rights and freedoms contained in the Cypriot Constitution and in most international conventions ratified by Cyprus. d) Competences of the designated body/bodies \u2013 and their independent exercise The Equality Body lacks both competence and resources to provide independent assistance to victims or to represent victims on Court. It is vested with the power to (i) combat racist and indirectly racist discrimination as well as discrimination forbidden by law and generally discrimination on the grounds of race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs and national or ethnic origin, 517 (ii) promote equality of the enjoyment of rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Cyprus Constitution (Part II) or by one or more of the Conventions ratified by Cyprus and referred to explicitly in the Law 518 irrespective of race, community, language, colour, religion, political or other beliefs, national or ethnic origin 519 and (iii) promote equality of opportunity irrespective of grounds listed in the preceding section (to which the grounds of special needs 520 and sexual orientation are added) in the areas of employment, access to vocational training, working conditions including pay, membership to trade unions or other associations, social insurance and medical care, education and access to goods and services including housing. At the level of the Equality Body, there appears to be a trend towards a more socio-legal approach that involves less the invocation, interpretation and application of legal provisions than in previous years, perhaps reflecting the non-legal specialisation of the members of staff of the Equality Body in this period. An interesting development may nevertheless be observed in the dynamic intervention of the Equality Body as regards the efforts of certain circles within the Ministry of Education to revoke exemption from the religious instruction class which was previously available to those students who would apply for it. For the first time, the Equality Body appears ready to impose the sanctions foreseen in its mandate, in order to restore the right to exemption from this class, as a means of safeguarding religious freedom in schools. 521 Its limited resources and budgetary restrictions have restricted the Equality Body\u2019s work mostly in the area of complaints investigation, although efforts are made to provide assistance and guidance to victims in spite of the constraints. In recent years a system was introduced whereby the various officers of this body take turns in answering phone calls from the public and offer oral advice on rights and procedures available. 517 The Combating of Racial and Some Other Forms of Discrimination (Commissioner) Law No. 42(I)/ 2004, Article 3(1)(a). 518 These Conventions are: Protocol 12 of the European Convention for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; the Covenant for Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 519 The Combating of Racial and Some Other Forms of Discrimination (Commissioner) Law No. 42(I)/ 2004 (19 March 2004), Section 3(1).(b), Part I. 520 \u2018Special needs\u2019 is a term commonly used in Cyprus to encompass all types of disabilities including psycho- social disabilities.

        "124 The Equality Body may carry out independent investigations into various issues 522 on its own right where it deems that any particular case may constitute a violation of the law. 523 The Equality Body may also issue codes of good practice regarding the activities of any persons in both the private and public sector, obliging them to take practical measures for the purpose of promoting equality of opportunity irrespective of community, racial, national or ethnic origin, religion, language and colour. 524 The Equality Body has the duty to make recommendations to the competent Minister, the parliament and affected groups of persons on, inter alia, the amendment of any legal provision or regulation which constitutes unlawful discrimination. The law empowers the Equality Body to issue such recommendations either in its own right 525 or following a specific complaint to that effect referred to the Equality Body. It also has the power to conduct independent surveys and compile reports on any matter within its competency concerning any activity or practice in the public or private domain. 526 In addition, the law casts an obligation on the Equality Body to communicate its findings and reports to the Attorney General who will, in turn advise the Republic on the adoption or not of appropriate legislative or administrative measures and prepare legislation for the abolition or substitution of the legislative provision which is contrary to the anti- discrimination law. 527 However, as it is currently phrased, the law allows the discriminatory law to remain in force until officially amended by the House of Parliament. This is a discrepancy in the law that renders compliance with the directives questionable, because it allows for the law to remain in force even if the Attorney General delays or omits to take steps for its amendment. In December 2014 the Supreme Court ruled that this provision can only be interpreted so as to mean that the Attorney General is under a duty to inform the executive regarding changes in the legislation deemed necessary by the Equality Body and that had the legislator intended to give power to the Attorney General to reject the recommendations of the Equality Body, the wording of the law would have explicitly provided that the Attorney General may adopt, amend or reject the recommendation. 528 This development has not as yet been tested in order to conclude that the Attorney General will adopt this interpretation and proceed with the change of laws as recommended by the Equality Body.

The Equality Body\u2019s orders must be published in the Official Gazette. The Equality Body has no power to impose criminal sanctions; all criminal cases are referred to the Attorney General\u2019s office for action. Also, where there is a disciplinary offence, the Equality Body has the duty to refer this to the competent authority: for instance, if the offender is a public servant, the Equality Body must refer the case to the Minister in charge, so as to take action. e) Legal standing of the designated body/bodies In Cyprus the Equality Body does not have legal standing to bring discrimination complaints on behalf victims, whether identified or not, or to intervene in legal cases concerning discrimination, although its officers may appear as expert witnesses. The legal officers of the Equality Body have repeatedly expressed their regret over the fact that they are not mandated to take cases to the Courts. Under the existing legislation, the Equality Body\u2019s duty is confined to referring cases to the Attorney General\u2019s office so as for the latter to decide whether criminal charges must be instigated, whilst civil lawsuits are clearly the responsibility of the litigants themselves. So far, no charges have been brought against any person by the Attorney General invoking the anti-discrimination legislation. f) Quasi-judicial competences In Cyprus the Equality Body is a quasi-judicial institution. 532 It is clearly an administrative organ but does have the power to issue binding decisions as well as sanctions, although these powers have not so far been utilised. The Equality Body prefers to use its mediation function where possible or to issue recommendations where mediation is not possible. A decision of the Equality Body can be appealed against through a recourse to the Supreme Court for judicial review of an administrative act under article 146 of the Constitution. Although no evaluation or assessment has been made publicly available nor are compliance rates published, generally speaking the recommendations of the Equality Body are taken seriously into consideration by the private sector and to a certain extent by the public sector. Since the organisation\u2019s inception in 2004, the immigration authorities have undoubtedly the lowest rate of compliance amongst all public authorities. In previous years, the police also had a low compliance rate although in recent years a closer collaboration with the police developed over joint initiatives in the fight against racism and homophobia has improved the police\u2019s compliance rates. g) Registration by the body/bodies of complaints and decisions In Cyprus the Equality Body records the number of complaints received and the reports issued by ground and field of application as well as by the ethnic origin of the complainant.

The statistical record is available to the public and is set out in the Equality Body\u2019s annual reports which are posted on its website albeit with some delay, usually at the end of the year following the year concerned. h) Roma and Travellers Although not a number one priority, the Equality Body is concerned with the situation of the Roma and has on two occasions in 2003 conducted self-initiated investigations into their housing conditions. In 2011 it has published a report on discrimination against Roma children in education, in response to a complaint submitted in 2008. No measures have been taken to raise awareness amongst the Roma community of rights and procedures available to them under the new antidiscrimination legislation, presumably as a result of the restricted budget and limited resources of the Equality Body and the practical difficulties involved in accessing the Roma communities (language problem, illiteracy, Roma settlements in remote locations). Although there are inherent difficulties in commencing a structured dialogue and consultation with the Roma community, which is a measure strongly recommended by the Fourth ECRI Report on Cyprus published in 2011, the Equality Body is in a unique position to launch such an initiative; under the current circumstances of austerity however, the Equality Body can hardly manage with its existing workload.

        "127 8 IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES 8.1 Dissemination of information, dialogue with NGOs and between social partners There have not been any government activities during 2015 to disseminate information on non-discrimination and no good practices in the field either. Generally speaking, on issues of policy making, consultation with NGOs is either poor or non-existing. In 2015 there was no policy making or law making in the field of anti- discrimination. Measures to promote dialogue between social partners to give effect to the principle of equal treatment within workplace practices, codes of practice, workforce monitoring (Article 11 Directive 2000/43 and Article 13 Directive 2000/78) Dialogue with social partners on issues of discrimination at the workplace is lacking; no code of conduct has been agreed upon nor is there any system for workforce monitoring. Addressing the situation of Roma and Travellers. The government has not taken any measures to specifically target the Roma in terms of dissemination of information or dialogue. The thematic priority of Roma integration was not selected for inclusion in the programmes to be funded under the European Union Structural Funds for the period 2014\u20132020 and there will be no allocation of funds for this priority. 533 Cyprus has no specific Roma integration strategy and no policies vis-a-vis the Roma community except in the field of education. The general approach of government policy is to promote Roma integration through horizontal measures targeting vulnerable groups in general in the frame of existing wider polices and structures for social inclusion, such as general integration policies, the National Reform Programme and the National Strategy for Social Policy 2014-2020, targeting the increase in employment and decrease of poverty and social exclusion. It is questionable whether any of these measures have any actual impact on the Roma, who continue to live in extreme poverty and exclusion, with no efforts made by the authorities towards the preservation of their cultural identity or towards raising awareness and respect for their distinct identity and culture amongst society or towards engaging with their representatives in order to consult them on policies and impact. 534 Given that there are no policies targeting the Roma, there are no separate mechanisms monitoring the implementation of policies vis-a-vis the Roma. The Welfare Services, who act as the national contact point for the implementation of the national Roma Integration strategies, estimate that there 650-700 Roma who are Cypriot citizens in the area under the control of the Republic of Cyprus, out of a total of 1250 Roma in the whole of Cyprus; there are no estimates as regards the number of migrant Roma or Sinti residing in Cyprus. Overall the Welfare Services consider that the number of Roma residing in Cyprus is rather small to deserve a separate and distinct approach from other vulnerable groups. 535 The recognition in 2009 by the Cypriot government of the Roma as a minority within the meaning of the Framework Convention on National Minorities has not led to a change of 533 Letter from the General Directorate of European Programmes, Coordination and Development, 1 December 2014. 534 Counsil of Europe (2015), Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Fourth Opinion on Cyprus , 2 November 2015.

        "128 policy or any measures to improve the situation of the Roma, a fact regretted by the Advisory Committee\u2019s Third Opinion on Cyprus. The opinion states that the Roma continue to face serious prejudice and difficulties in many fields, such as employment, housing, education and access to health services, whilst the establishment of a dialogue between the government and the Roma remains problematic. The Committee urged the government to identify ways to establish a structured dialogue with the Roma and to obtain up-to-date information regarding their ethnic, linguistic and religious affiliation. The government responded by stating that \u201cissues regarding the Cyprus Roma are part of the overall policy planning of the Government\u201d without indicating any specific policies to address the problems highlighted. 536 The Fourth ECRI report on Cyprus published in 2011 also urged the authorities to engage into consultation with the Roma community in order to address problems of housing, employment and education. By 2015, when the Advisory Committee for the FCNM published its report on Cyprus, no progress had been made in this direction. 537 8.2 Compliance (Article 14 Directive 2000/43, Article 16 Directive 2000/78) a) Mechanisms The existing constitutional practice is such that any law or regulation contrary to the principle of equal treatment, as guaranteed by Article 28 of the Constitution, and the human rights sections of the constitution, is unconstitutional, as the principle underlies all relevant laws. Once declared by the Court as unconstitutional the law is considered null and void. However, in order to trigger this provision, an application must be filed in court by a person who has been wronged as a result of the implementation of a law which runs contrary to the Constitution, seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional. So far, no law has been declared unconstitutional by reason of non-compliance with the equality provision of the Constitution (article 28), except laws providing for positive action measures in favour of persons with disabilities. The provisions contained in the international treaties, signed and ratified by the Republic, take precedence over any municipal law and therefore override any provisions that are contrary to the principle of equal treatment. Also, by virtue of a 2006 amendment of the Constitution, all EU directives and regulations are deemed to take precedence over all domestic legislation including the Constitution itself. There is no procedure for a regular monitoring or screening of old or new laws, collective agreements, contracts or rules etc. in order to ensure their compliance with the anti- discrimination laws. Practice shows that the procedure for assessing compliance of a particular law, contract, practice etc. with the anti-discrimination laws is triggered off only when a specific complaint is submitted on this matter. The mechanism under national law by which provisions in agreements, contracts or rules relating to professional activity, workers and employers that are contrary to the principle of equal treatment can be declared null and void or amended is contained in the law setting out the mandate if the Equality Body. 538 This procedure requires the Equality Body to refer to the Attorney General all laws, regulations and practices containing discrimination; the Attorney General is then obliged to advise the Minister concerned and prepare the necessary amendment in the discriminatory law or practice.

        "129 particularly well known to legal and judicial circles, who tend to go for the constitutionality test, i.e. to request the Court to annul a provision or a law as \u2018unconstitutional\u2019, for non- compliance with article 28 of the Constitution which contains the equality principle. As a result of restrictive interpretations by the Court, this procedure has never borne fruit for the victims of discrimination, nor has it ever resulted in annulling a law containing discrimination. 539 The Equality Body\u2019s referrals to the Attorney General under article 39 were not always taken up and often laws and regulations containing discriminatory provisions remain unaffected as a result. It is expected that the 2014 ruling of the Supreme Court in Nicoletta Charalambidou , which established that the Attorney is not at liberty not to pursue the Equality Body\u2019s recommendation for amendment of a discriminatory law, will change the practice so far followed by the Attorney General\u2019s office. 540 b) Rules contrary to the principle of equality There was never any exhaustive scan of laws or regulations to assess their consistency with the anti-discrimination directives or their compliance with the equality principle in general. A problem of non-compliance usually surfaces when a complaint is filed with the Equality Body but even in such case there is no system for recording the non-compliant laws or rules in a single database. No exhaustive list of laws or regulations that are contrary to the equality principle can be drawn up, since the legislative and policy framework has not been thoroughly scanned for compliance with the directives. A series of complaints have triggered recommendations from the Equality Body to the Attorney General to proceed with law reforms, many of which were not pursued. Based on the cases of non-compliance highlighted by the Equality Body, there are job advertisements in the public service which carry an age limit; job descriptions which require \u201cexcellent knowledge of Greek\u201d as a prerequisite or where the criterion to test knowledge of Greek can only be met by graduates of Cypriot schools; rent control laws which exclude third country nationals from their scope; restrictions in the retirement benefits paid to public employees aged under 45 who take early retirement in order to join EU institutions; the Termination of Employment law which deprives persons reaching pensionable age from their right to compensation for unlawful dismissal; and no doubt many others in respect of which no complaint was submitted and thus no decision of the Equality Body was issued to highlight the need for repeal. 539 Cyprus, Supreme Court, Michalakis Raftopoulos v.

        "130 9 COORDINATION AT NATIONAL LEVEL There is no single authority or Government department responsible for the overall coordination of the implementation measures under the anti-discrimination laws. Several ministries are involved depending on the issue at stake: the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance deals with issues such as employment and social insurance benefits; the Ministry of Justice and Public Order deals with issues of legislation drafting and interpretation; the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior with their respective competencies. The annual reports of the Ministry of Justice and Public Order sum up the Ministry\u2019s activities in this field in providing information that feeds into various national and European level reports. 541 There has never been any national Action Plan on anti-racism or anti- discrimination. 541 For the latest available annual report of the Ministry of Justice, which is for the year 2012, see http://www.mjpo.gov.cy/mjpo/mjpo.nsf/3E7D11C068594790C2257C99003FB470/$file/Annual_Report_201 2.pdf.

        "131 10 CURRENT BEST PRACTICES Code of Conduct against Racism and Guide for Handling and Recording Racist Incidents This initiative sets up a system of monitoring, recording and intervening to combat racial and other intolerant incidents at schools. The Code sets out basic principles of respect for multiple identities and of the need to combat intolerant incidents on the grounds of ethnicity, religion, culture, gender, sexuality, belief and disability. It explains in simple terms various forms of racial, xenophobic and other types of intolerance and defines concepts such as identity, diversity, race, prejudice, stereotype, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, nationalism, intolerance, homophobia, transphobia, bullying/threatening, hate speech, under-reporting and racial incidents. The Guide aims at developing a mechanism for recording and reporting racial and other intolerant incidents, addressing all stakeholders, allocating to each group specific responsibility in recording and responding to the incidents. Moreover, it provides for a step- by-step system of handling racial incidents as well as a nine-step sanction system based on the degree of seriousness and the repetition of the prohibited conduct. The Code and the Guide were launched in June 2014. Implementation was commenced on a pilot basis in seven primary schools during 2015, 542 With the intention of expanding to other schools in the years to follow. At the time of writing, the Ministry of Education had not published any data regarding the incidents recorded or any evaluation as regards the impact of this initiative. Educational Priorities Zones (ZEP) The Educational Priorities Zones (ZEP), a measure which has been in existence since 2003, promotes literacy and school achievement in economically and socially depressed areas throughout Cyprus and addresses youth delinquency and early school leaving. 543 Schools selected to join ZEP are those were delinquency and illiteracy in secondary education can be traced back to; the aim is to prevent these two phenomena at primary education and pre-school before they appear at secondary education. The institution has secured funding from the European Commission through the European Social Fund for the project \u201cProgramme against Early Abandonment of school, against School Failure and Delinquency in Educational Priority Zones\u201d, which has enabled ZEP to employ additional teachers to operate smaller units in the morning, to employ teachers to implement programmes of creative occupation in the afternoons and to set up in every district Centres for information and psychosocial support. The measure brings extra hours of teaching at the school for the weaker students, free breakfast, afternoon supervision for homework and generally extra state funds to enable the school to cope with disadvantaged areas and families, Cypriot or non-Cypriot, having to survive on low budgets; in practice the measure mostly benefits migrant children. For the year 2014-15, nine secondary education schools throughout the country were included under ZEP. The number of third country national pupils attending these schools in 2014-2015 was 2,505. Opinions vary as regards the effectiveness of the practice of ZEP. Educationalists have noted that ZEP carries a stigma which leads certain schools to reject the Ministry\u2019s offer to join the institution. But criticisms from educationalists are mainly focused on the fact that in practice the measure has promoted segregation of migrant students into specific schools, 542 www.moec.gov.cy/agogi_ygeias/kodikas_kata_ratsismou.html. 543 For more information, see Demetriou, C.

        "133 11 SENSITIVE OR CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES 11.1 Potential breaches of the directives 1. The additional functions/mandate extensions assigned to the Equality Body/Ombudsman without an increase in its budget has led to considerable delays in decision making, to the extent that the effectiveness and impact of the institution is now at question. The freezing in recruitments to the public sector, imposed as a result of the economic crisis, has meant that it cannot hire personnel even if only to replace those who resign from the service. Also, many of the officers of the Equality Body are not legally trained, which is reflected in the reports published: references to laws and case law are usually lacking whilst legal responsibility for clearly unlawful acts is hardly ever pinned on the perpetrators. The shortages in human resources has also meant that the monitoring of compliance with the decisions is adversely affected. 2. The requirement of Article 13 of the Racial Equality Directive that the specialized body should be in a position to offer assistance to victims is still not transposed, more than 10 years after the directive was transposed, as the Equality Body cannot represent victims in Court. To be able to do so, in addition to an expanded mandate, the Equality Body should be afforded the necessary budget and human resources which it is now lacking. In addition, the Equality Body has not issued a single binding decision or imposed any fine for more than 10 years since it was set up, resorting only to mediation or non-binding recommendations. In the case of fines, this may be partly attributed to the fact that the fines foreseen in the legislation are too low to be seen by the perpetrator as a disincentive. 3. Very rarely do discrimination cases make it to the courts. In those cases, where they do, the anti-discrimination legal framework is not being invoked; instead recourse is made to the 40-year old constitutional provisions (judicial review of administrative acts; and/or the general equality provision of article 28) which do not offer the far- reaching protection of the directives. The decision is often based on problematic legal doctrines arbitrarily developed by the courts which do not comply with the directives and which deny victims the protection offered by the directives. 4. Litigation is not sufficiently used, owing to the cost and time length involved, the fact that legal aid is made available only subject to insufficient means, and to the lack of awareness of the anti-discrimination laws amongst the legal profession. The sanctions foreseen in the law for discrimination are neither dissuasive nor effective and, given the fact that the equality body\u2019s decisions so far were mere recommendations, victims of discrimination are, in practice, not afforded the mandatory legal protection foreseen in the directives. There is little coordination between NGOs and lawyers for effective handling of cases. 5. In recent years, the government has completely abandoned efforts to raise awareness about the directives, to promote equality initiatives or to consult with civil society. This is the case even with KYSOA, the confederation of disability organisations, which in 2006 was afforded the status of a social partner. In the case of disability and age, the equality agenda is subsumed into a \u2018welfarism\u2019 mentality governed by \u2018charitable\u2019 approaches which seem to be prevalent amongst policy makers and some sectors of civil society. 6. As a concept, positive action continues to be viewed with suspicion by the Courts and by policy makers alike, who appear willing to apply it only to persons wronged by the Turkish invasion (war veterans, persons with a disability resulting from the war) as part of the national project of promoting their sense of \u2018victimhood\u2019 but otherwise find that it violates the equality principle enshrined in the Constitution. 7. There is no procedure in place for regular reviewing or revising of discriminatory laws/regulations. In practice, review is only triggered off once a complaint is submitted to the equality body. In such a case, the law requires the equality body to refer discriminatory laws/regulations to the Attorney General who is then under a duty to prepare the amending legislation. In spite of the several referrals to the Attorney General, few of the laws found by the equality body to be discriminatory ",
        "134 have been amended. This procedure however is very rarely followed, to the effect that several discriminatory laws remain in place. 8. Following the labour tribunal decision in 2008 establishing that it has no jurisdiction to hear claims of discrimination in the selection process for a job placement, the law transposing Directive 78/2000 (minus the disability component) was amended. However, the authorities failed to amend the law on disability. In considering an appeal against the first instance decision of the tribunal, the Supreme Court disagreed with the tribunal\u2019s findings as regards its jurisdiction, but did not explicitly rule that the labour court has jurisdiction to try all discrimination cases irrespective of whether an employment relationship exists or not. 9. Regarding discrimination at the workplace, the inequality of power between the employers\u2019 lobby and workers\u2019 unions, despite the apparent strength of the latter, is accentuated by the fact that Cyprus has a very large SME sector, whose individual members generally lack professionalism and awareness on issues of labour rights and discrimination. This sector is one of the worst hit by the economic crisis and the violation of workers\u2019 rights has become commonplace. 10. There is no law explicitly providing that an authority\u2019s failure to act on complaints of discrimination amounts to discrimination or imposing a general anti-discrimination public duty on authorities. Many complaints directed against various governmental departments are simply not addressed or dealt with, without any consequences for the departments concerned and serious instances of discrimination go unpunished. 11.2 Other issues of concern 1. Judicial practice on discrimination claims often deviates from the letter and the spirit of the directives, rejecting discrimination claims by using the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 test. The use of this test has led the courts to reject direct discrimination claims which were thought to be \u2018reasonable\u2019, in breach of the equality directives which allow only a limited range of exceptions. 2. As the economic crisis deepens and unemployment rises, anti-immigrant sentiments are being hyped. The new government\u2019s declarations upon assuming office in March 2013, that Cyprus would cease to be \u2018a migrant\u2019s paradise\u2019 have not only met with the tacit acceptance of the social partners but have also led to a gentleman\u2019s agreement amongst the social partners that employers should employ \u2018primarily Cypriots\u2019. In 2013-2014 employment-related complaints to the Equality Body dropped by half compared to previous years, whilst there were no discrimination court cases from employees against their employers; both must be attributed to underreporting owing to fear of losing their jobs amidst the deep recession. The austerity package has also affected pensions and welfare benefits for the elderly, the majority of whom live below poverty levels. 3. On 20 November 2014 the Cypriot police entered a gallery operated by the Nicosia municipality and confiscated an entire exhibition of photographs taken by a transsexual photographer and activist, depicting male nude in an artistic fashion. The exhibition had been organised by the national gay movement Accept LGBT Cyprus. The police pressed charges against the president of Accept LGBT Cyprus under a law dating back to 1963 regarding the publication of obscene material. 545 The Ombudsman, whose representative was a speaker at the opening of the exhibition, condemned the actions of the police and asked for the revision of the law on obscene publications under which the president of Accept had been charged. 546 Following the Ombudsman\u2019s intervention, the Attorney General publically criticised the police for 545 Law on the publication of obscene matters of 1963 (\u039f \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1963) N. 35/1963.

No action was taken against the police officers involved in the operation nor was the law on obscene publications revised, suggesting a lack of political will to deal decisively with homophobia amongst law enforcement officers. 4. The national specificities of Cyprus are the result of what can be termed as country- specific structural problems. These consist mostly of issues deriving from the unresolved \u2018Cyprus problem\u2019, which creates problems of discrimination resulting from the de facto division of the country e.g. failure to use Turkish as an official language of the Republic of Cyprus; discrimination against Turkish-Cypriots (T/Cs) in access to property and in the exercise of various constitutional rights, the violation of Greek- Cypriot (G/C) rights by Turkey and a certain tendency of the authorities and of the courts to \u201cseek revenge\u201d for the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The Cyprus problem can also be blamed, at least partly, for a general lack of tradition in equality issues deriving from the 40-year old persistent predominance of the Cyprus problem in the public sphere. The G/C resentment of the constitutional quota system for T/Cs in the public sector, the history of ethnic conflict and the continuous application and expansion of the \u2018doctrine of necessity\u2019 by the authorities and the courts subordinate\u2019s equality issues to political expediencies and place a disproportionately strong emphasis on state sovereignty. The legal vacuum created by these \u2018Cyprus problem\u2019-related practices is also used in order to deny basic rights to immigrants who, according to the latest census (2011) currently form 21% of the Cypriot population. 5. The comprehensive educational reform that commenced in 2008, soon after the former government took office came to a halt when the new government came into power in March 2013. The new curriculum developed under the reform, aiming at rendering the school democratic, inclusive and multicultural has been abandoned, alongside with the pioneering methods of teaching, as the system has reverted to the old curriculum and the old methods used before the reform was implemented. Tensions as regards the teaching of the religious class, which had in previous years been toned down, were hyped again in 2015 following an initiative of the Ministry of Education to encourage students to assist with the conducting of the Christian orthodox ceremony which received lengthy criticism from the Equality Body. 547 The Ministry initiative, however, and the arguments offered by the Ministry in its defence, may suggest that religious intolerance in education is deeply rooted in obsolete mentalities and stereotypes maintained by the teachers themselves. 6. The pressing needs of the Roma and migrant children in education are no longer debated, nor are there any new policies to address their needs. Instead, the phenomenon of migrant children being forcibly separated from their mothers by the immigration authorities, as mothers are massively deported for illegal stay, is on the rise and has become the subject of public debate and of a number of international monitoring reports. Interestingly, this particular method of the immigration authorities is the only one criticized, and the critique mainly emanates from women activists, women politicians and women journalists. 547 Cyprus, Report of the Anti-discrimination Authority regarding the respect of religious freedom at schools of primary and secondary education, File Nos. \u0391\u039aR 1/2014, \u0391\u039aR 6/2014, \u0391\u039aR 19/2014, \u0391\u039aR 73/2014, 18 June 2015.

        "136 12 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN 2015 12.1 Legislative amendments The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is extended During 2014, the disability law was amended to extend the duty to provide reasonable accommodation to fields beyond employment. 548 Please refer to section 2.6 above for details. During 2015, three new laws were adopted seeking to protect specific groups of people from specific forms of discrimination: - The criminal code was amended to criminalise incitement of hatred or violence on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity; 549 - A new law was adopted regulating the political rights of public sector employees providing for their right to express political or other beliefs freely outside their working hours, to participate in political parties and to be nominated or be elected in office within any political party. 550 - A new law now regulates the civil union (or \u2018cohabitation agreement\u2019, as is the term used in the law) of both heterosexual and homosexual couples, 551 implicitly benefiting not only same sex couples but also couples who for any reason whatsoever choose not to get married. The minimum guaranteed income and the ICF test In 2014 a new system of assessing disability was introduced by the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance, which relies on the logic of functionality and is based on an international standard known as \u0399CF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. 552 The introduction of this system coincides with the comprehensive reform of the welfare system in 2014 that replaced the public benefit previously available to vulnerable group with the minimum guaranteed income, introducing stringent conditions of eligibility. \u03a4he law on the minimum guaranteed income (MGI) adopted the perception of disability introduced by the CRPD but also requires that eligibility to this benefit depends on being certified as having a serious or total disability by the System of Classification of Disability, 553 thus essentially combining two conflicting views on disability. This provision will most negatively affect those who are not already public assistance receivers, like the newcomers to the welfare system, who will not be entitled to the minimum guaranteed income unless they pass the test of the System of Classification of Disability.

        "137 classification test, in which case they must also pass the test in order to retain their eligibility. The confederation of disability organisations KYSOA opposes the new system of classification. KYSOA, who is designated as a social partner to be consulted on all disability related matters, 554 believes that the system will exclude a significant number of persons with disabilities from public assistance and lead them into marginalisation. 555 KYSOA also finds that a classification system based on functionality is closer to the much criticised \u2018medical model\u2019 and deviates from the social model of approaching disability, which is promoted by the CRPD. KYSOA\u2019s repeatedly calls on the government to enter into a round of consultation in order to reach a consensus as to the system of assessing disability have not been answered so far. KYSOA demands that the system of assessing disability be in line with the philosophy of the CRPD, according to which disability is acquired through interaction with the physical and social barriers. Based on this, policy development must be focused on removing the barriers and not on introducing functionality assessment systems which are unlikely to lead to any benefit for persons with disabilities. In spite of the objections of the disability movement, the government will be allocating the entire amount to be received by the EU\u2019s structural funds (ESF) package for 2014-2020 for disability discrimination for the operation of the ICF system. The application of the ESF in Cyprus generally suffers from a lack of transparency; it is virtually impossible to retrieve information from the competent body handling these funds 556 or from any their source and consultation with NGOs, stakeholders or the Equality Body regarding the application of the funds is virtually inexistent. The implementation of the law on the MGI revealed further gaps and weaknesses of the law. When initially adopted, the law required applicants with intellectual disability to submit their applications only through a legally authorised representative; this provision essentially forced potential applicants to apply to the Court to be declared \u2018incapable\u2019 in order to become eligible to the minimum guaranteed income. Following criticisms from the disability movement and from the Equality Body, 557 the law was amended to provide that applications could now be submitted through the applicant\u2019s representative, without providing a definition of such representative or a procedure for his or her appointment. 558 The Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance (the ministry) issued instructions to the Social Welfare Services (SWS) to refrain from demanding \u2018incapacity\u2019 court orders in those cases where the applicant with intellectual disability had a joint bank account with another person. 559 554 Cyprus, Law on the process of consultation of state and other services regarding persons with disability of 2006 ( O \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0386\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03a5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u0398\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u0386\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 2006 ) \u039d. 143(I)/2006.

",
        "138 This policy measure however did not address the situation of applicants without such a joint account. The Committee for the Protection of Persons with Mental Handicap 560 (the committee\u2019) reported that, in spite of the legislative amendment, the SWS continued to request court orders in order to pay the MGI to persons with intellectual disabilities who did not have a joint bank account with another. The committee identified gaps which persisted in spite of the reforms, highlighting the fact that the SWS now required that a relative of that person or a member of staff of the institution/home where the person resides be appointed by the court as administrators of that person\u2019s estate in order to collect the cheque. The committee also criticised the fact that banks refuse to open accounts for persons with intellectual disability residing with their families on the justification that they are not in a position to manage the bank account. The committee requested the ministry to resolve the issue by specifying the procedure for appointing a representative and for making the payments of the MGI either to the families or to the institutions or homes in the community where applicant resides. Meanwhile the Equality Body, in its capacity as independent authority for the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities, published a report on the implementation of the CRPD, highlighting the gaps and weaknesses of the law on the administration of the property of incapable persons. The report concluded that this law contravenes article 12 of the CRPD and results in discrimination as it renders persons with disabilities particularly vulnerable to being declared \u2018incapable\u2019 by the court, which deprives them from equal enjoyment of rights. The report stressed that the law ratifying the CRPD ranks higher than the law on the administration of the property of \u2018incapable\u2019 persons and must be annulled and calls on stakeholders to assist in the process of developing structures and mechanisms and bringing those changes to the legislative framework that will render national law and practice compliant with the CRPD. 561 The ministry issued another circular to the SWS 562 instructing them to request persons representing applicants with intellectual disability to sign a statement assuming responsibility for handling the MGI payable to the beneficiary without a court order, following which a cheque can be issued in favour of the first degree relative who has signed such a statement. Persons with disability without a first degree relative can be represented by another close relative or another person who signs the statement provided the SWS is satisfied that this is in the interests of the beneficiary. The reasoning behind this procedure, as explained in this circular is to avoid having the applicant with intellectual disability sign any document whatsoever or deciding who will represent him or her because the legal capacity of such person is legally questionable. There is no particular procedure nor is there any test prescribed for the determination of the interests of the beneficiary and there is no mechanism in place for supported decision making, which essentially means that the SWS is once again vested with discretion to make this decision on behalf of the person with disability. 12.2 Case law Court Decisions Quotas in favour of persons with disabilities 560 http://www.cpmental.com.cy/epnka/page.php?pageID=7&langID=0. 561 Position of the Independent Authority for the Promotion of the Rights of Persons with Disability regarding the implementation of obligations under the ratified UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and in particular article 4 (\u201cGeneral Obligations\u201d) and article 12 (\u201cEqual Recognition before the Law\u201d) [ \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03bc\u03b5\u0391 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03c1\u03b5\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1, \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, \u03a3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u0397\u0395 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u0386\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1 4 (\u00ab\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03c1\u03b5\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2\u00bb) \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 12 ( \u00ab\u038a\u03c3\u03b7 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u00bb] \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2], File No, AYT.4/2015, 25 June 2015.

        "139 Name of the court: Supreme Court, Review Jurisdiction Date of decision: 3 September 2015 Name of the parties: Costas Tsikas et al v The Republic of Cyprus through the Educational Service Committee Reference number: Case No. 1519/2010 and 1520/10 Webpage: www.cylaw.org/cgi-bin/open.pl?file=apofaseis/aad/meros_4/2015/4-201509- 1519- 10etc.htm&qstring=%F7%E1%F1%F4%2A%20and%20%E8%E5%EC%E5%EB%E9%F9 %E4%2A%20and%20%E4%E9%EA%E1%E9%F9%EC%E1%2A%20and%202015 Brief summary: The claimants applied to the Court seeking to annul a decision of the respondents which had appointed two persons with disability as teachers in public schools under a law providing for quotas in favour of persons with disabilities. The claimants argued that the quotas law violates articles 20 and 21 of the Fundamental Rights Charter, article 14 of the ECHR and article 28 of the Constitution because it results in unfair differentiation between candidates on the basis of personal characteristics and not on the basis of their ability to fulfil the duties of the position they compete for. They also argued that the quota of 10% introduced by the quotas law does not take into account the percentage of disabled persons in relation to the total number of candidates with the necessary qualifications, which violates the equality principle as it excludes suitably qualified non-disabled persons from securing a position in the public sector. The Court rejected the argument that quotas are unlawful and disagreed with the submission of the claimants that previous Supreme Court judgements had established that laws providing for quotas were unconstitutional. The Court clarified that the equality principle as established in Article 28 of the Constitution safeguards against arbitrary differentiations but does not exclude reasonable ones which are allowed as a result of the essential nature of the circumstances. In such cases, the Court added, differential treatment of unequal or exceptional situations does not amount to a deviation from, but on the contrary to a practical implementation of, the equality principle; in this case the priority given to persons with disabilities falls within the boundaries of reasonable differentiation precisely for implementing equality. The Court adopted the reasoning of the ECtHR that protection from discrimination is violated when a state fails to offer different treatment to persons whose circumstances are significantly different 563 and referred to the right of states to adopt positive action as established in the equality Directives. The claimants\u2019 application was rejected and the decision to appoint the interested parties in the public service was confirmed. Age seniority as a criterion for promotion Name of the body: Supreme Court, Appellate jurisdiction Date of decision: 3 April 2015 Name of the parties: Charis Christodoulidou v Republic of Cyprus through the Public Service Committee Reference number: 12/10 Webpage: www.cylaw.org/cgi-bin/open.pl?file=apofaseis/aad/meros_3/2015/3-201504- 12- 10.htm&qstring=%F7%E1%F1%E9%F3%20and%20%F7%F1%E9%F3%F4%EF%E4%EF %F5%EB%E9%E4%EF%2A Brief summary: The appellant, a public servant, had applied for a promotion position but the Public Service Committee selected another candidate who was older. She appealed against this decision claiming that to the extent that it relied exclusively or primarily on age seniority it violated the Employment Equality Directive and the law transposing it. The Court rejected the first instance application, on the ground that the Public Service Committee\u2019s reference to age seniority does not appear to be the determining factor in selecting another candidate for promotion. The trial court added that taking age seniority 563 The cases cited were Thlimmenos v Greece , Case No. 34369/97 and Pretty v United Kingdom , Case No. 2346/02. ",
        "140 into account not only is lawful but it is sanctioned by the public service law 564 which provides that where two employees have the same date of appointment, seniority is determined on the basis of the employees\u2019 age. The appellant appealed against the trial court\u2019s decision, on the ground that the consideration of an employee\u2019s biological age, as distinct from their seniority in the particular employment in question, in order to determine selection for promotion between employees with the same date of appointment, amounts to age discrimination which violates the Directive. Citing article 267 of the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union, the appellant requested a preliminary referral to the CJEU of the following two questions: - Can articles 1 and 2(2), 3 and 6(1) of the Directive be interpreted as permitting national legislation providing that promotion applications are examined on the basis of inter alia seniority and where this is the same amongst competing appellants then to be assessed on the basis of age? - If the answer to the above question is affirmative, does the non-promotion of a person who meets all requirements and has all qualifications exclusively on the ground of age amount to unlawful discrimination? The appeal pointed out that given that the decision of the Appeal Court will be of the final instance, article 267 of the Treaty imposes a duty on the Court to refer these questions to the CJEU. The Court found that the issue is acte claire and does not require CJEU interpretation since the question does not concern an interpretation of Union law but rather an examination of the compatibility of the Civil Service Law (N. 1/90, article 49) with the Directive, which is beyond the remit of the CJEU. In her appeal, the appellant relied on the Directive and on the CJEU rulings in K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci , \u039cangold , Palacios de la Villa and Age Concern England to argue that: - The first instance Court decision failed to examine whether the criterion of seniority in the sense of biological age which is foreseen by the Civil Service Law amounts to discrimination on the ground of age in violation of the Directive; - The trial Court\u2019s conclusion that seniority in the sense of age was not the determining factor in the decision was wrong. The Appeal Court rejected both arguments on the ground that the Directive permits member states a wide margin of appreciation regarding the measures to be adopted in the field of social policy, provided the measures do not violate the principle of non- discrimination, citing the CJEU rulings in Mangold, Palacios de la Villa and Age Concern England. The Court concluded that the regulation of the issue of seniority by the Civil Service Law cannot be deemed as violating the principle of non-discrimination, since it does not place any particular civil servant or a group of civil servants to a disadvantageous position. The provision in the Civil Service Law is, according to the Court, a fair and objective regulation of the issue of seniority, applied to all cases of employees in the same position and does not result in discrimination against the appellant. Age restriction in a disability scheme Name of the body: Supreme Court, Review Jurisdiction Date of decision: 27 January 2016 Name of the parties: Petros Michaelides v The Republic of Cyprus through the Minister of Labour and Social Insurance Reference number: 2005/2012 Webpage: http://cylaw.org/cgi-bin/open.pl?file=apofaseis/aad/meros_4/2016/4- 201601-2005-2012.htm&qstring=%E4%E9%E1%EA%F1%E9%F3%2A%20and%202016 Brief summary : In 2012 the claimant applied to the authorities for a grant under a welfare scheme for severe kinetic disability indicating that he had suffered a stroke that confined 564 Law on Public Service No. 1/1990, Article 49.

The scheme in question excludes applicants aged under 12 and over 65 years unless they have become eligible before they turned 65 565 and the claimant\u2019s application was therefore rejected. In July 2012 his son contacted the Department for Social Integration of Persons with Disability of the Ministry of Labour (DSIPD) asking for the deletion of the age limit in the scheme. The DSIPD responded that they were aware that some of their schemes needed modifications but due to restrictions in finances as a result of the economic crisis they were \u201cunable to immediately modernize the scheme\u201d. The claimant applied to the Supreme Court for judicial review seeking to set aside the rejecting decision, claiming age discrimination in violation of article 28 of the Constitution, of the CRPD and of the law setting up the Equality Body. 566 In justification of the age restriction, the respondents said the age restriction was intended to reduce the number of eligible applicants due to poor state finances and argued that no discrimination had occurred because the claimant was treated in the same way as other persons in his position and his age group. The Court ruled that the age restriction in the scheme violated the Law on Persons with Disabilities N. 127(I)/2000 which could not be justified by the measures to address the economic crisis, as the fiscal interests of the state cannot be equated with the general public interest, adding that deviations from the equality principle are only allowed to the extent that the constitutional provisions themselves allow and subject to the proportionality principle. The court also dismissed the respondent\u2019s argument that the grant foreseen in the scheme was not protected by a constitutional right as it was discretionary in nature. The Court annulled the rejecting decision affecting the applicant but, as the procedure review process does not go further than setting aside of the administrative decision, could not order the revision of the scheme in question.

Applicants are assessed for compliance with the Law\u2019s definition of \u2018a person with disabilities\u2019. The Law further provides for the creation of a special multi-thematic committee (MTC) comprising of medical professionals. The MTC gives expert opinion as regards the applicant\u2019s disability and suitability for the job. A Greek teacher with a visual disability whose application for inclusion in the catalogue of teachers with a disability was rejected, applied to the court for judicial review of the rejecting decision. She had submitted medical certificates showing that she suffered from degenerative lesion macular in both eyes and that her visual acuteness is 1/20 after correction. Her case was referred for examination to the MTC as foreseen by article 5 of the Law. The MTC assessed the applicant on the basis of its \u201cProtocol of Evaluation\u201d and found her to meet the Law\u2019s definition of a person with disabilities. The MTC\u2019s opinion was communicated to the respondent who interviewed the applicant and decided to reject her application, relying on their conclusion that her health problem does not place her in a disadvantageous position compared to other candidates.

        "142 judicial review upon application by the applicant in 2014; the court decided to annul it due to lack of investigation and justification and as a result of an error of law. 568 This decision was subsequently appealed against and the determination of the appeal was pending at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the applicant\u2019s vision deteriorated upon which she re-applied for inclusion in the special catalogue and was again rejected, this time on the justification that her health condition renders her unsuitable for working as a teacher. She applied again to the court for judicial review, arguing that the decision of the respondent lacked proper investigation, was not justified and was taken in violation of the procedure, as the respondent failed to take into account the opinion of the MTC. The respondent claimed that the opinion of the multi-thematic committee was not binding and that it retained the right to carry out its own investigation; it further argued that the mere fact that applicant met the definition of \u2018person with disabilities\u2019 did not impose a duty on the administration to take MTC\u2019s advice and include her in the special catalogue of candidates. The court rejected the respondent\u2019s arguments as regards the non-binding nature of the opinion of the multi-thematic committee establishing that the appointing body is compelled to take into consideration the opinion of the multi-thematic committee. If the multi- thematic committee found that the applicant met the definition of disability foreseen in the Law and found her suitable for appointment, and these findings coincided with the conclusions of the medical certificates submitted by the applicant, the interview carried out by the respondent and the questions put to the applicant did not provide any insights into the question at hand, which was the applicant\u2019s health condition. The Court ruled in favour of the applicant and annulled the rejecting decision, for not having been properly investigated, for lacking justification and for relying upon an error of law. Reports of the Equality Body/ Ombudsman / NHRI/ Independent Authority for the rights of persons with disability 569 Equality Body report on the rights of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to equal access to health care Name of the court: Anti-discrimination Authority Date of decision: 22 October 2015 Name of the parties: \u039d/\u0391 Reference number: 22/2015 Webpage: www.ombudsman.gov.cy/Ombudsman/ombudsman.nsf/All/048DDA1B614BE873C2257EF C00339466/$file/%CE%91%CE%9A%CE%A122_2015_22102015.doc?OpenElement Brief summary: \u0391 Jehovah\u2019s Witness filed a complaint at the Equality Body against the Ministry of Health regarding the medical treatment provided to him and to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in general and the refusal of the ministry to cover the costs of medical treatment in the private sector, where treatment in accordance with his religious beliefs could be provided. In 2011 the complainant had applied to be placed on the waiting list of a public hospital for an operation. Even though he had declared from the beginning that he was a Jehovah \u2019s Witness and that, for religious reasons, he required a that blood transfusions would not be performed during the operation, he was placed in the waiting list of a hospital that did not have the necessary equipment for this kind of operations. In 2014 when he discovered this he applied to the Ministry of Health for referral to another hospital that had the necessary equipment available for a \u201cbloodless operation\u201d. The new hospital however refused to share any information as regards to the method and equipment to be used. The events created a doubt as to whether public hospitals could adequately respond to his demand for a \u201cbloodless operation\u201d and he applied to the ministry again for coverage of the costs in order to have the operation in the private sector. His application was rejected at the first and second instance. 568 Supreme Court, Eleni Paroutsi v. the Republic of Cyprus, Case No. 1449/2012, 14 March 2014. 569 These three authorities operate from within the office of the Ombudsman.

        "143 The report issued by the Equality Body stated the right of a person to choose a medical treatment that may pose health risks was recognised by the ECtHR in a 2010 decision 570 where the imposition of a medical treatment contrary to a person\u2019s consent was found to infringe article 8 of the ECHR. The issues surrounding the medical treatment of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had been raised by the Equality Body in 2007 571 with a report which included recommendations for equal access to state services which had been ignored by the health authorities. The failure of the authorities to consider and address the complainant\u2019s request for \u201cbloodless treatment\u201d and the refusal of the health authorities to provide him with the requested information amounted to a failure to provide equal access to health care. The delay of several years and the entire unsatisfactory handling of his case by the health ministry created a reasonable doubt in the complainant\u2019s mind as to whether public hospitals could provide a service that would be respectful of his religious convictions. The report concluded that the complainant was denied access to state health services on the ground of his religious convictions and ruled that the state was under an obligation to cover the costs of treatment in the private sector in order to ensure access to health services that complied with his religious beliefs and do not violate his religious freedom. Conditions of welfare eligibility for persons with intellectual disability Name of the body: Independent Authority for the Promotion of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Ombudsman\u2019s office) Date of decision: 7 April 2015 Name of the parties: N/A Reference number: \u0391/P 2354/2014, \u0391/P 162/2015, \u0391/P 483/2015 Webpage: www.ombudsman.gov.cy/Ombudsman/Ombudsman.nsf/All/78F6368F0F1FEEB9C2257E7 B0024E278/$file/2354.2014%CE%BA.%CE%B1-7415.doc?OpenElement Brief summary: In 2014 the Cypriot welfare system was comprehensively reformed through the adoption of a new law that replaced the system of benefits payable to vulnerable groups with the \u2018minimum guaranteed income\u2019 572 (the MGI law). Amongst other new conditions of eligibility, the MGI law required persons with intellectual disability to present a court order under the law on the administration of the property of \u201cincapable\u201d persons 573 declaring them \u2018incapable\u2019 and appointing a person as their legal representative for managing their affairs. Without such a court order, the applications of intellectually disabled applicants could not be considered. The Committee for the Protection of Intellectually Retarded Persons 574 and several groups of parents of persons with intellectual disabilities complained to the Ombudsman\u2019s office. The Ombudsman, who examined this complaint in her capacity as Independent Authority for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, appointed under article 33(2) of the CRPD, found that this requirement is an obstacle to equal access to the minimum guaranteed income on the ground of disability; obtaining such a court order required considerable cost and time, and was forcing persons with intellectual disability to sign off their legal capacity, thus abolishing their rights in a number of other fields. The Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance (hereinafter the ministry) informed the Ombudsman that the purpose of this provision was to satisfy the concerns of banks who had raised an issue regarding the legality of depositing the 570 ECtHR, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of Moscow and others v.

        "144 welfare payments accruing to persons with intellectual disability into the bank accounts of their parents who lacked legal authorisation to manage these funds. The ministry had sought the Attorney General\u2019s opinion as regards this practice, who confirmed that persons representing persons with intellectual disability in any activity, including the managing of their property, must be duly authorized to do so through a court order. The Ombudsman\u2019s report found that both the ministry and the Attorney General\u2019s office failed to consider whether this practice was compatible with the non-discrimination laws and the CRPD. The Ombudsman pointed out that the CRPD required states to provide support to persons with disability whenever they face difficulties in decision-making, enabling them to decide for themselves about issues affecting them, rather than resort to the unjustified deprivation of their legal capacity. The Ombudsman equated the duty to provide support to persons with disability to exercise their legal capacity with the duty to provide reasonable accommodation, breach of which amounts to unlawful discrimination. By contrast, the court order which the ministry requires in order to consider an application for the minimum guaranteed income cancels in an absolute and irrevocable way the person\u2019s legal capacity and his or her right to equality before the law. In essence, persons with intellectual and psychosocial disorders were forced to choose between the minimum guaranteed income and their legal capacity which is a prerequisite for their access to other fundamental rights and an important factor in their equal participation and integration. The Ombudsman described this measure as \u201cviolent and massive, perpetuating obsolete stereotypes and prejudices\u201d. In conclusion, the Ombudsman asked for the revision of the MGI law and for a practical interim solution to ensure access of all adult persons with intellectual or psychosocial disability to the minimum guaranteed income without the adverse consequences of losing their legal capacity. In response to the criticisms raised by the Ombudsman and by the disability movement, the law was amended by removing the requirement for a \u2018legal authorisation\u2019 of the applicant\u2019s representative. 575 The law now provides that the application for the MGI may be submitted by \u2018a representative\u2019 of the applicant with intellectual disability, without providing a definition of such representative or a procedure for his or her appointment. The Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance (the ministry) issued instructions to the Social Welfare Services (SWS) to refrain from demanding an \u2018incapacity\u2019 court order in those cases where the applicant with intellectual disability had a joint bank account with another person and to pay the minimum guaranteed income into such account. 576 This policy measure did not address the situation of applicants without such an account. The absence of any regulation meant that the problem remained largely unaddressed. The Committee for the Protection of Persons with Mental Handicap, 577 (the committee), reported that, in spite of the legislative amendment, the SWS continued to request court orders in order to pay the minimum guaranteed income to persons with intellectual disabilities who did not have a joint bank account with another person. In a letter submitted to the ministry, the committee identified the following gaps which persisted in spite of the legislative and policy reform: a) Whilst previously these institutions/homes were able to cash the cheques issued in the name of their residents, the SWS now required that a relative of the applicant or a staff member of the institution/home where the person resides be appointed through the court as administrators of that person\u2019s estate in order to collect the 575 Cyprus, Law amending the law on minimum guaranteed income and generally on social provisions (\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u03af \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0 \u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0395\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03b3\u03b3\u03c5\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03ce\u03bd \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 2014 ) 118(I)/2015, article 4(3).

        "145 cheque. A large amount of cheques was returned to the SWS uncashed, because the residents of the institution/home did not have a legal representative formally appointed. In other instances, relatives of the person who were appointed by the Court as legal representatives refused to pay the fees due to the institution/home where the person was residing, which in the long term is likely to jeopardize the financial sustainability of these structures. b) Banks refuse to open accounts for adult persons with intellectual disability residing with their families on the justification that they are not in a position to manage the bank account. The committee is highly critical of the fact that the assessment of the person\u2019s abilities is made by a bank official without expertise and without following any set procedure. To assist with the efforts of finding a solution, the Equality Body in its capacity as independent authority for the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities carried out a self-initiated investigation into the implementation of the CRPD, focusing in particular on articles 4 (general obligations) and 12 (equal recognition before the law). The report highlighted the gaps and weaknesses of the law on the administration of the property of incapable persons, 578 adopted over a decade before the CRPD was ratified, which promotes the concept of the \u2018incapacity\u2019 rather than supported decision-making. The report concluded that this law contravenes article 12 of the CRPD and at the same time raises issues of disability discrimination as it renders persons with disabilities particularly vulnerable to being rendered \u2018incapable\u2019 by the court, which deprives them of equal enjoyment of rights. The report further stressed that the law ratifying he CRPD ranks higher than the law on the administration of the property of \u2018incapable\u2019 persons and describes extensively the framework for supported legal capacity, as this emerges from article 12 of the CRPD and from the observations by the UN Committee. 579 There were no cases brought by Roma or Travellers in 2015. 578 Cyprus, Law on the administration of the property of incompetent Persons of 1996 ( O \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9o\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0391v\u03af\u03ba\u03b1v\u03c9v \u03a0\u03c1o\u03c3\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9v \u039d\u03cc\u03bco\u03c2 \u03c4o\u03c5 1996 ) N. 23(I)/1996.
