        "3 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 Editorial Dear colleagues, I am delighted to present Issue No. 14 of the . This issue comes shortly after the European Parliament re-elected me as European Ombudsman for another five-year term. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who supported my campaign for re-election. This is an exciting time to be European Ombuds- man. One of my main priorities over the next five years will be to help ensure that the EU delivers the benefits for citizens promised by the Treaty of Lisbon. Of particular importance is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which, for the Union institutions and in most Member States, now has the same legal value as the Treaties. I am determined to help citizens make full use of their rights under the Charter and the Treaty of Lisbon. To this end, I shall continue to work with national and regional ombudsmen in the Member States to inform citizens about their rights and what to do when they have problems exercising those rights. The right of citizens to move freely within the EU and, more specifically, obstacles encountered by individuals in this area, continue to give rise to complaints to ombudsman offices in the European Network of Ombudsmen. One specific aspect of free movement rights was explored in the last issue of this publication in an article by my office on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. In July of last year, we launched a discussion on the EUOMB-Summit, asking which ombudsman offices have competence in this area. An article in this issue provides a summary of the results of that consultation and of my own research, which allowed me to draw some hopefully useful con- clusions. From the UK, the Parliamentary Ombudsman brings to us a case that illustrates how maladmin- istration in the processing of applications for resi- dence cards continues to hinder citizens from moving freely and settling in the EU. In a similar case, the Belgian Federal Ombudsman highlights shortcomings encountered in the implementation of EU law concerning the right to family reunifica - tion for nationals of third countries who are fam- ily members of a Union citizen. The Portuguese Ombudsman describes the obstacles which inhab- itants of former Portuguese India face when seek- ing to reacquire Portuguese nationality and as such, when seeking to enter the EU. Another main feature in this issue is gender equal - ity. In his contribution to the Newsletter, the Greek Ombudsman shares with us the main find - ings of his first special report on the equal treat - ment of men and women in employment and labour relations in his country. In another contri- bution, the Greek Ombudsman addresses discrim- ination against women in the examinations for admission to military academies. In addition, the Ombudsman of Aragon, Spain, puts forward guidelines for combating gender-based violence in a more comprehensive manner. Last year marked the twentieth anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this issue, the Estonian Chancellor of Justice devotes an article to the urgent need for a children's ombudsman in his country, and to the challenges of establishing the institution. In her contribution, the Ombudsman of Azerbaijan focuses on her office's activities in light of the twentieth anniver - sary of the above Convention. The Ombudsman of Marche, Italy, highlights the plight of unaccom- panied foreign minors in his region with which various institutions have to deal, often with inad - equate means and limited resources. The environment also features prominently in the Newsletter. An article by my office describes a case in which major works were undertaken in a project to extend Vienna airport before an envi - ronmental impact assessment had been carried out. The Polish Ombudsman highlights the lack of protection of ecological characteristics of natu- ral habitats, and species of animals and plants in connection with projects benefiting from agri- ",
        "4 Editorial April 2010 environmental funding from the EU. The Hungar - ian Ombudsman for Future Generations talks of the accomplishments of his office, since commenc - ing operations two years ago. Several contributions in this issue outline the work that ombudsmen conduct on behalf of seg- ments of society that are particularly vulnerable. The Human Rights Ombudsman of Slovenia raises the issue of the representation of the Roma minority. The Ombudsman for Social Affairs of Schleswig-Holstein advocates no nursery charges for low earners, while her counterpart in Rhineland- Palatinate refers to the benefits of e-petitions. Other colleagues touch on issues that affect citi- zens in their daily lives, such as the case of iden - tity fraud, described by the Dutch Ombudsman, and dissatisfaction of rail service users, described by the Ombudsman of Piedmont. Finally, as you all know, legislation providing for the abolition of the institution of the local ombuds- man in Italy has been enacted. In his contribution to this Newsletter, the IOI Vice-President for Europe, Rafael Rib\u00f3, outlines the efforts he has undertaken to defend local ombudsman in Italy. As European Ombudsman, I am determined to do all I can to promote the establishment of a national ombudsman in Italy and look forward to working with the National Co-ordinator, Mr Animali, and the regional ombudsmen towards this goal.

He was accompanying the President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski, to a war memo- rial service in Katyn, Rus- sia, when the TU-154 presidential plane in which they were travelling crashed near Smolensk, Russia. Janusz Kochanowski was born on 18 April 1940. He was elected to the post of Human Rights Defender of Poland on 27 January 2006 for a five- year term. During his term of office, Dr Kochanowski was an active member of the European Network of Ombudsmen, and worked ceaselessly to defend the rights of Polish citizens and to promote human rights. Our thoughts are with his wife, Ewa, and his two children, Marta and Mateusz, as well as with all the staff of the Polish Ombudsman's office. He will be greatly missed. A full tribute to Dr Kochanowski will be included in the next issue of the Newsletter. ",

During Ms Steinke's previous term of office, a new system for the presentation of public petitions was introduced. The new web gateway e-Petitionen makes it even easier for people to present their petitions online or to support petitions by signing them on the website. This facility won the Petitions Committee the Politikaward for the best political innovation of 2008. Ms Steinke was born in Bad Frankenhausen in 1958 and is an agricultural engineer. During her political career she has been a member of the Thuringian state parliament and has held a seat in the German Bun- destag since 2005 as a representative of the Left Party. We congratulate Ms Steinke on her re-election, and look forward to continuing fruitful co-operation with her.

The new General- Secretariat has been operational since 1 September 2009. The IOI Board of Directors met from 19 to 21 November in Vienna. The list of participants reflects the organisation's global outreach: ombuds - men from the United States, Canada, Hong Kong and Korea met their counterparts from Zambia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. European ombudsman institutions from Sweden, Greece and Spain participated, alongside their colleagues from the Bermuda Islands and Trinidad & Tobago. The Board meeting focused on the conclusion of the relocation process and the business plan for 2010. Mr Peter Kostelka, IOI Secretary-General, set the scene ahead of the meeting: \u201cI believe that we should not limit our range of activities to a mere information exchange between member institu- tions. We should consider it equally important to develop best practice examples as well as to set benchmarks for a fair and transparent administra- tion. Board members will therefore also discuss the possibility of frequent training activities, the sup- port of academic research and stronger co- operation with international organisations. The World Bank acknowledges the particular importance of the principle of good governance. Due to its specific expertise, the IOI could become a valuable partner specifically for new democracies, which specifically focus on the support of the rule of law and the fight against corruption.\u201d In this context, the Secretary- General also re-emphasised the strong political support in Austria, which made it possible to relo- cate the IOI General-Secretariat from Canada to Austria: \u201cBoth the federal government and the city of Vienna, as well as the National and the Federal Council, unanimously supported this project from the beginning. It is therefore a great honour that the President of the Federal Council will welcome the IOI Board members during their visit.\u201d The International Ombudsman Institute is an inde- pendent and non-political organisation established in 1978. The IOI's main purpose is to encourage close co-operation and information exchange between ombudsman institutions all over the world. The IOI is organised in regional chapters in Africa, Asia, Australasia and the Pacific, in the Car - ibbean, as well as in Latin America, Northern America and Europe. The IOI has 150 members that comprise national and regional ombudsman insti- tutions from 75 countries. The General-Secretariat of the IOI is located on the premises of the Austrian Ombudsman Board in Vienna. In line with the organisation's by-laws, a member of the Austrian Ombudsman Board was appointed as Secretary-General of the IOI. Mr Peter Kostelka has held this office since June 2009. The Secretary-General manages the administrative office, which is also in charge of project management. Peter Kostelka Secretary-General of the IOI Decisions of the European Board of Directors At its meeting on 19 November 2009 during the IOI Board of Directors meeting at the IOI General- Secretariat in Vienna, the European Board of Direc- tors decided to accept the invitation of the EOI (European Ombudsman Institute) to discuss the IOI's proposal to relaunch the IOI-EOI Joint Com- mittee with a view to ensuring closer co-operation between the two ombudsman associations. To that end, an IOI-EOI joint meeting took place in Rotterdam on 3 February 2010, at which the Boards of Directors of the two Institutes agreed to work towards a single strong organisation. The IOI has invited the EOI Board to its next European confer- ence, to be held in Barcelona in October 2010, to dis- cuss the adoption of specific measures for the relaunch of the IOI-EOI Joint Committee. The European Board of Directors held its first meet - ing of 2010 on the same date. It discussed a mission ",

Both documents are to be presented at the Barcelona conference in October. Support to local ombudsman institutions in Italy In response to the Italian government's adoption of the Finance Act for 2010, under which municipali- ties will have to abolish their ombudsman institu- tions as from 2011, in my capacity as European President of the IOI, I sent a letter of support to the Co-ordinator of Italian Ombudsmen, expressing the organisation's solidarity and its willingness to take steps to defend the threatened institutions. I therefore went to Rome in January to offer my sup- port at the annual co-ordination meeting of Italian ombudsmen. I also met the Italian President, Mr Giorgio Napolitano, to express the IOI's concern at the announcement that local Italian ombudsmen are to be abolished and will no longer have a budget appropriation from 2011. The President was very interested and undertook to follow up the issue raised. Ombudsmen are not uniformly represented throughout Italy, and Italy does not have a national ombudsman. The abolition of these institutions would therefore represent a clear reduction in mechanisms for protecting citizens' rights. Representation of the European region of the IOI at various events The IOI European region was represented at the fol- lowing events: the 15 th anniversary of the Ombuds- man of the Walloon region in Namur, Belgium (December 2009); the opening of the headquarters of the Association of Mediterranean Ombudsmen in Tangiers (November 2009); the 10 th anniversary of the Albanian Ombudsman in Tirana (December 2009); the Third Meeting of the Association of Med- iterranean Ombudsmen in Athens (December 2009); the 90 th anniversary of the Parliamentary Ombuds- man of Finland in Helsinki (February 2010). Next European region conference and general assembly in Barcelona Many proposals and contributions have been received from the various ombudsman institutions in connec- tion with the programme and speakers for the next IOI European region conference and general assem- bly, to be held in Barcelona from 3 to 5 October under the title: \u201cEurope as an open society: a global and inclusive vision of migration within our countries\u201d. On the basis of these contributions, we have drawn up a programme which outlines the main topics of discussion. These are: Europe as an open society, the rights of immigrants, mechanisms to prevent torture, and ombudsmen. At the opening session, we will have the honour of welcoming the European Ombudsman and the highest authorities of Catalonia, who will set out their views on the challenges facing the ombuds- man in Europe.

ARTICLES EUROPEAN OMBUDSMAN Follow-up of the Commission's proposal for a directive on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare In the last issue of the European Ombudsmen \u2013 Newsletter , we published an article on the European Commission's proposal to the European Parliament and Council for a directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare 1 . The arti- cle summarised the existing legal framework and presented the main aspects of the Commission's proposal 2 . The present article provides a follow-up of the proposal and information on the action that the European Ombudsman has taken in relation to Amendment 92, which envisaged the creation of a \u201cEuropean Patients Ombudsman\u201d 3 . In July 2009, the European Ombudsman consulted his colleagues in the European Network of Ombudsmen in order to gather information about their competence and experience in the field of cross-border healthcare. In particular, the members of the Network were requested to provide informa- tion as to whether their office had received com - plaints with regard to prior authorisation, reim- bursement of costs or damages in cross-border healthcare; and whether their mandate allowed them to deal with such complaints. In addition, the 1 Proposal for a new directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, on the application of patients' rights in cross- border healthcare, COM(2008) 414 final. 2 European Ombudsman \u2013 Newsletter , Issue No. 13, October 2009, pp. 15-18. 3 Amendment 92: \u201cThe Commission shall present a legislative proposal to establish a European Patients Ombudsman within 18 months after the entry into force of this Directive. The Euro- pean Patients Ombudsman shall consider, and if appropriate, mediate on patient complaints with regard to prior authorisa- tion, reimbursement of costs or harm. The European Patients Ombudsman shall only be engaged once all the complaint options within the relevant Member State have been exhausted\u201d. Office of the European Ombudsman conducted its own research in relation to the above questions. The results of the consultation conducted with the Network and the Ombudsman's own research allowed him to draw some useful conclusions. In particular, it transpired from the information col- lected that the majority of national ombudsmen and similar bodies are competent to deal with patients' right in cross-border healthcare. In some countries 4 , special representatives or departments deal with healthcare and social security complaints. Some members of the Network 5 informed the European Ombudsman that they had already successfully dealt with relevant cases and provided examples, which mainly concerned reimbursement of costs. According to those members, the problems encoun- tered in the area of patients' mobility did not result from the lack of dispute resolution mechanisms, but from the lack of clarity in the applicable legisla- tion, and lack of information on patients' rights. They noted, consequently, that the proposed direc- tive should focus on raising awareness and improv- ing patients' access to information, rather than pro- vide for new remedies. Considering that national ombudsmen are better placed to deal with complaints relating to prior authorisation, reimbursement of costs or damages in cross-border healthcare, the European Ombuds- man contacted Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate, MEP and the European Parliament's rapporteur on the cross-border healthcare directive, in order to present the results of his survey and the Network's views. In the meantime, the Council of the European Union discussed the draft directive in December 2009 but was unable to reach an agreement because a small group of Member States refused to sign up to the agreement despite attempts by the Swedish 4 For instance, the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece. 5 Namely, the Irish Ombudsman, the Petitions Committee of the German Bundestag and the Ombudsman of Luxembourg.

In the search for a compromise, the intention was to fully respect the case-law of the Court of Jus- tice of the European Union while preserving the Member States' right to organise their healthcare systems. The current Spanish Presidency undertook to continue the work and try to reach an agreement, although the Commission may now decide to with- draw the proposal. The European Ombudsman will follow develop- ments closely. Contact: Christina Karakosta; christina.karakosta@ombudsman.europa.eu GREECE Ombudsman publishes first special report on gender equality In his first special report, published on 10 Novem - ber 2009, the Greek Ombudsman concluded that sex discrimination prevents social development and economic growth. In the report, titled Equal treat- ment of men and women in employment and labour rela- tions , the Ombudsman presented the main develop- ments regarding gender equality in the EU and Greece, and evaluated the application of Greek leg- islation (law 3488/2006) on the equal treatment of men and women. The report covers the period starting in May 2008, when the new gender equal- ity department of the Ombudsman was established, and ending in April 2009. Main political and legis- lative initiatives, at European and national level, and legal issues raised in cases brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union also feature in the report. Particular emphasis is, nevertheless, given to the legal, procedural and practical issues raised during the implementation of the Greek gen- der equality law as demonstrated by the many com- plaints by citizens that the Ombudsman has dealt with, either independently or in co-operation with the Greek labour inspectorate, since May 2008. The Ombudsman's conclusions and specific proposals are included in the final part of the report. By law 3488/2006, which incorporated Directive 2002/73/EC 1 into Greek law, the Greek Ombuds- man was entrusted with the tasks of a \u2018gender equality body\u2019, in line with the afore-mentioned Directive. The Ombudsman's new gender equality department monitors application of the principle of equal treatment of men and women in the area of employment. The area of competence of the new department has recently been expanded to include cases of sex discrimination in access to goods and services as regards the public sector, in compliance with Council Directive 2004/113/EC 2 . Between May 2008, when the department was established, and April 2009, the Ombudsman received 230 com- plaints related to sex discrimination against employees and persons seeking employment. In particular, the Ombudsman was asked to inter- vene in cases related mainly to dismissal or other- wise disadvantageous treatment of pregnant employees and to the conditions for granting the special six-month maternity protection leave. These two categories of cases feature in the Ombudsman's report as individual dossiers. The rest of the cases that the Ombudsman dealt with include sex dis- crimination in access to employment, sexual har- assment, discrimination in payments and salaries associated with the appearance of the employee, and discrimination as regards the granting and conditions of parental leave. Co-operation between the Ombudsman and the Greek labour inspectorate has resulted in concrete benefits for employees only in certain cases as, in more than a few cases, there was practically no co-operation. In the framework of his participation in European networks, and in response to a questionnaire sent by the European Commission, the Ombudsman submitted a research-based report on pay gaps between men and women. The new department also participated in international conferences and seminars. 1 Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employ- ment, vocational training and promotion, and working condi- tions. 2 Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 imple- menting the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services.

        "17 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 The Ombudsman's main findings during the said period, as listed and explained in the report, are the following. \u2022 The legal and other instruments provided by the European Commission are sufficient to enable the Member States to pursue the nec- essary initiatives and produce results, while the related judgments delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union contribute to a wider level of protection from sex dis- crimination. \u2022 Greece lags behind in the incorporation into national law of the EU directives on the equal treatment of men and women, and does not readily apply the instruments of European law already at its disposal. \u2022 The Greek law of 2006 on gender equality is a significant new development, at national level, and grants multiple benefits to employ - ees and those who seek employment. \u2022 Problems, misunderstandings and friction encountered in the application of the law are mainly due to: the general lack of an equality culture in Greek society and Greek enter- prises; lack of jurisprudence at national level; difficulties while applying the rule of reversed burden of proof; the Greek admin- istration and labour inspectorate having lim- ited experience and knowledge of the specific legislation on equal treatment of men and women; and employers and employees not being adequately informed. On the basis of these findings, the Ombudsman made the following proposals. \u2022 National policies related to the equal treat - ment of men and women in employment need to be brought into line with European policies while national legislation should conform to the acquis communautaire . \u2022 All parties involved, i.e., public authorities, social partners, trade unions, and non- governmental organisations, will have to intensify their efforts in the provision of information to citizens, especially employees, regarding the role the ombudsman institu- tion, as a gender equality body, plays in tack- ling sex discrimination. They should also regularly inform the Ombudsman of any rel- evant complaints or grievances that may come to their knowledge. \u2022 All parties involved should give new empha - sis to preventive action through regular co- operation and exchange of best practices and experience. \u2022 The state should encourage and reinforce the Ombudsman's extrajudicial intervention capacity and his co-operation with the labour inspectorate as an alternative means to re- establishing equal treatment of men and women in the workplace. The Ombudsman addressed further sector-specific proposals to the competent government depart- ments, the civil service, labour inspectorate, social partners and non-governmental organisations.

Under this Regulation, the Spanish Ministry of Health has established that medicines are financed through social security resources or state resources allocated to health under the National Health Ser- vice. Such medicines are prescribed and dispensed to patients who have not been hospitalised and who 1 Council Directive 89/105/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the transparency of measures regulating the fixing of prices of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in national sickness insurance schemes. ",
        "18 April 2010 European Union Law are entitled to them, certain proprietary medicines being excluded. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the Supreme Court has ruled that the rational use of medicines in the National Health Service, from which its public funding comes, is an obvious requirement of a public system which, in defence of general interest, has to strike a balance between rationalising expenditure, limited resources, grav- ity of pathologies, the needs of certain groups and the therapeutic and social use of medicines. The Court ruled that the Ministry of Health Order that excludes certain proprietary medicines from public funding is lawful. As far as homeopathy is concerned, meanwhile, the Ombudsman has been paying particular attention to the lack of a legal framework ensuring appropri- ate supervision of the quality and suitability of activities and products used in what is known as alternative medicine, an issue underlying a signifi - cant number of the complaints lodged with this institution. In this respect, the Ombudsman has previously stressed that such activities and products may have a direct or indirect effect on citizens' health, that it cannot be denied that a large number of people ask for such techniques and undergo the corresponding treatment, and that in recent years, there has been a substantial increase in advertising and publicity surrounding such products. Since the above legal framework seeks to guarantee the quality of the care that patients need by ensur- ing that the risks entailed in procedures and their effectiveness are known, this institution has urged the Ministry of Health to accept the need to organ- ise and regulate non-conventional diagnostic or treatment techniques that come under the title of alternative medicines, so that people who use them benefit from the same assurances as those required for other branches of conventional medicine. In its reply, after stating that it shared the Ombuds- man's view regarding the large number of people who seek alternative treatment which may directly or indirectly affect their health, the Ministry said that it wished to establish such a legal framework, thereby bringing Spanish legislation into line with World Health Organization guidelines. It also said that it was holding periodic meetings with repre- sentatives of various organisations linked to such therapies in order to regulate their practice. As a result, and since there has as yet been no firm attempt to address the legal vacuum surrounding non-conventional, alternative or complementary medicine, this issue has been highlighted in the Ombudsman's annual reports submitted to Parlia- ment. Stress will continue to be laid on the need for adequate regulation in this area in order to ensure that the corresponding legislative procedure is set in motion.

The Directive therefore represents a dual opportu- nity: it is a key factor in moving towards a genuine internal market for services at EU level and it offers an excellent opportunity to bring about a signifi - cant change in Spanish regulatory culture. The Directive will allow administrative burdens to be reduced and will give service providers greater legal security. It will also offer consumers much more choice and improve service quality both for consumers and for companies that use services. All public authorities should have adapted the reg- ulations that are relevant to them before 28 Decem- ber 2009, and have therefore had to examine them to determine whether they are affected by the Directive or not. The Spanish government has partially transposed the Directive into the Spanish legal system through Law No. 17/2009 of 23 November on free access to 1 European Parliament and Council Directive 2006/123/EC of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market.

It establishes the provisions and principles required to ensure free access to services on Span- ish territory for providers established in Spain or in any other EU Member State. Procedures will be streamlined while a high level of quality in services will be fostered by means of a transparent and pre- dictable regulatory framework that promotes eco- nomic activity, enhances the modernisation of local government in response to corporate and consumer needs and ensures better protection of the rights of consumers and service users. The Law came into force 30 days after it was pub- lished, except as regards one-stop shops and administrative co-operation, which did not come into effect until 27 December 2009. Section 2 of Final Provision 5 on the adaptation of the current rules states that: \u201cIn order to ensure compliance with Article 44 of Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal mar- ket, Autonomous Communities and Cities and Local Authorities shall notify the Central Govern- ment, before 26 December 2009, of the laws, rules and regulations under their jurisdiction which have been amended to adapt them to the Directive and to this Law\u201d. The Ombudsman of La Rioja, aware of the impact the Services Directive will have on regional rules and on local authority powers, has taken the fol- lowing measures. Two legal studies were undertaken on the constitu- tionality and legal consequences of: \u2022 Law No. 17/2009 of 23 November within the jurisdiction of the Autonomous Community of La Rioja (measure.2009/0461-EAR) on 9 December 2009; \u2022 Law No. 25/2009 of 22 December within the jurisdiction of the Autonomous Community of La Rioja (measure.2009/0510-EAR) on 28 December 2009. Several ex officio proceedings against local authori- ties were announced on 13 January 2010. The Ombudsman of La Rioja has the authority to initiate ex officio measures or complaints in order to set in motion the investigation procedures estab- lished in Law No. 6/2006 of 2 May with a view to protecting and defending citizens' rights as enshrined in the Constitution, specifically in Title I. Some of these, particularly those in Section 1 of Chapter II, benefit from special assurance mecha - nisms since they concern fundamental rights and freedoms, and do not make it necessary to wait for a specific individual or collective complaint. It should first be noted that the ombudsman institu - tion of La Rioja is legitimately entitled to take steps to supervise administrative measures and like the local administration, it will give force to this Direc- tive and its transposition by means of national law. The rights of citizens who may be affected and whose involvement justifies the Ombudsman's action are set out in Title I of the Spanish Constitution: \u2022 The right of citizens, as consumers, recog - nised by Article 51, which requires public authorities to protect them and to ensure their legitimate economic interests through effective measures. \u2022 Article 38, which recognises freedom of enterprise in the framework of a market economy and the public authorities' duty to safeguard and protect that freedom. A com- petitive environment encourages companies to improve the quality of their products and services and to adjust their prices. Competi- tion thus becomes a prime mover of innova- tion, technological progress and the search for more efficient means of production. This Ombudsman is aware of how much power local authorities have in the administration of citizens' affairs by means of various actions. Ex officio pro- ceedings are therefore aimed at local authorities. The body of law established by the municipalities, as producers of local regulations deriving from their constitutionally granted autonomy, may include many rules which, under the Services Directive, would potentially be in breach of services sector regulations. This could come from duplication of state or autonomous community principles them- selves affected by the Directive, or by any develop- ment of the different sectors that may be affected. The municipalities must begin to gauge which of their orders are affected, though understandably they may not have begun amending them as yet, given the delay involved in the adoption of the state and auton- ",
        "20 April 2010 European Union Law omous community rules of transposition, with which municipal orders must be brought into line. Through Law No. 25/2009 of 22 December, amend- ing various laws to adapt them to the law on free access to services, the state has tried to meet a dual objective: to adapt statutory national legislation to Law No. 17/2009, and further to stimulate the ser- vices sector and achieve gains in competitiveness over our European partners by extending the prin- ciples of good regulation to sectors unaffected by the Directive, adopting an ambitious approach which should help significantly to enhance the reg - ulatory environment of the services sector and effectively to remove unjustified or disproportion - ate requirements or barriers. The Preamble to Law No. 6/2009 of 15 December on tax and administrative measures for 2010 (BOR [Regional Official Gazette] No. 159 of 23 December 2009) outlines the aims of the Autonomous Com- munity of La Rioja in the following terms: \u201cThe final section of the law, in Title IV, amends several laws of varying scope in order better to achieve the objectives provided for in the Finance Act and to adapt autonomous community legislation to two European Union rules. The first and most compre - hensive is European Parliament and Council Direc- tive 2006/123/EEC of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market, also known as the Services Directive or the Bolkestein Directive. This Directive has made it mandatory for Member States to remove or limit a significant number of barriers which prevent or inhibit the development of serv- ices between Member States, with the aim of achieving the goal set by the Lisbon European Council (23-24 March 2000) of promoting employ- ment and social cohesion and sustainable economic growth. In so doing, the European Union will advance towards a much more competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy than it has enjoyed hitherto. All Spanish local administrations have therefore had to transpose the Directive, dero- gating from or amending any rules which stood in the way of meeting the objectives laid down at Community level.\u201d Leaving aside the much needed adaptation of local rules to the Directive and to the national and autono- mous community transposing the Directive, many local municipality procedures, formalities and courses of action will be affected by the Directive and the national law from the point of view of simplifying procedures and establishing the one-stop shop.

CASES EUROPEAN OMBUDSMAN Ombudsman identifies shortcomings in Commission investigation of Vienna Airport The European Ombudsman recently identified shortcomings in the European Commission's ongo- ing infringement proceedings against Austria con- cerning Vienna Airport. Since 1999, the infrastructure of Vienna Airport has been improved and extended via several building projects. Twenty-seven Austrian citizens' initiatives lodged a complaint with the Commission, arguing that the Austrian authorities had not carried out the necessary environmental impact assessment (EIA). The Commission agreed with the complainants that an EIA should have been carried out before the start of the extension works. However, since most of the projects had already been completed or were close to completion, the Commission abstained from taking Austria to court, given that the Aus- trian authorities agreed to carry out a retroactive EIA with a view to taking potential compensation measures. In May 2008, the complainants turned to the Ombudsman, alleging that the Commission had failed to properly conduct its infringement proceed- ings against Austria. After a thorough inquiry, the Ombudsman con- cluded that the Commission's approach was appro- priate and reasonable. He, however, identified sev - eral problems with the way the Commission had implemented this approach. Firstly, the ministry entrusted with carrying out the retroactive EIA was the same ministry that had issued some of the permits for the project. The Ombudsman shared the complainants' view that this might constitute a conflict of interest. Secondly, the Ombudsman stated that it would have been more logical to use 1998 as the base year for the retroactive EIA and not 1999, as accepted by the Commission. The works at the airport had already started in 1999. Thirdly, the Ombudsman expressed surprise at the fact that the Commission did not make sure that an adequate judicial review procedure would be avail- able to the parties interested in the case. Despite the significance of this right, the Commission had not sought explicit assurances from Austria to guaran- tee it. Furthermore, the Commission's answers to the Ombudsman's specific questions on this issue were not convincing. Since both the EIA and the Commission's investiga- tion are still going on, the Ombudsman has con- cluded that no further inquiries are justified and has closed the case. He has taken the view that he is unable to conclude that the Commission ensured that the retroactive EIA would be carried out properly. However, the Ombudsman is convinced that the Commission will take account of his findings when adopting its final decision on the infringement com - plaint. He pointed out that the complainants could turn to him again if the Commission's final decision does not satisfy them. Contact: Gundi Gadesmann; gundi.gadesmann@ombudsman.europa.eu ",
        "22 April 2010 European Union Law BELGIUM FEDERAL OMBUDSMEN Right to free movement European Directive 2004/38/EC 1 confers on citizens of the European Union and their family members the right to move and reside freely within the terri- tory of the Member States. In accordance with that Directive, Belgian law lays down the right to family reunification for nationals of third countries who are family members of a Union citizen 2 . This right allows family members of the Union citizen to go and live in Belgium. In a case referred to the National Ombudsman, the Belgian authority responsible for examining family reunification requests, the Office des \u00e9trangers (Office for Foreign Nationals), had refused to grant a fam- ily reunification visa to a Turkish national who wanted to join his wife and their child who had set- tled in Belgium. The reason given was that the indi- vidual concerned posed a threat to public order. To justify its decision, the authority cited a criminal conviction of the individual concerned, which dated back more than five years and involved acts com - mitted 10 years earlier. As the Federal Ombudsman challenged the justifi - cation for the decision on the grounds that it did not prove that the individual concerned still posed a threat to public order, the Office des \u00e9trangers demanded tangible evidence of his reintegration into Turkish society. The individual concerned then produced a recent copy of his criminal record, evi- dence of work and evidence of his effective family ties with his wife and child. However, the authority was not satisfied with this evidence. The free movement of persons is one of the princi- ples of the European Union. Under certain condi- tions, this right may be limited for public order, national security and public health reasons. When considering a family reunification request, the national authority has discretion in assessing 1 Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. 2 Belgian law of 15 December 1980 on admission to the territory, residence, settlement and removal of foreign nationals. whether the threat posed by the applicant to national security and public order is genuine, present and sufficiently serious. However, the authority does not have carte blanche to limit the right of entry and residence of family members of persons duly settled within the territory, particu- larly those family members of Union citizens. The authority must take account of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and that of the European Court of Human Rights regarding the right to respect for private and family life 3 . The European Commission recently noted in a com- munication 4 addressed to the European Parliament and to the Council that, even if the personal con- duct of the family member represents a present threat that is sufficiently serious to warrant a meas - ure restricting his/her freedom of movement or residence, the authority must still assess the pro- portionality of this measure by taking account of the personal and family situation of the individual concerned. In addition, as this concerns a right, the public order exception must be interpreted restrictively. The for- eign national should not have to produce evidence that he does not pose a threat to public order. It is for the authority to prove that the conditions are met to adopt a restrictive measure against this individual. Lastly, when the Office des \u00e9trangers refuses to allow a person to join a spouse who has settled in Bel- gium, where the couple have a child together, it must take due account of the best interests of that child and their right to remain in regular contact with both parents. The European Commission com- munication also points out that, in implementing Directive 2004/38/EC, Member States must always act in the best interests of the child, as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989. In the case cited above, the authority finally agreed to the Federal Ombudsman's proposal to examine the family reunification request of the Turkish national based on the available information and taking into account the existence of an effective family life and the best interests of the child.

Contact: Pierre Charlot; pierre.charlot@mediateurfederal.be GREECE Military academies discriminate against female candidates The Ombudsman received complaints regarding discrimination against women in the examina- tions for admission to military academies. The complainants focused on the increase of the lowest acceptable height of candidates, which was signifi - cant and disproportionate for female candidates. They also raised the issue of the establishment of a common performance threshold for men and women regarding the physical tests, noting in par- ticular that, in the shot put, female candidates were asked to use the same heavy ball used by male candidates. According to Greek legislation, a lower acceptable height is established for admission to military acad- emies and to officer cadet schools. As of 1 January 2009, that lower limit was increased by 5 cm for men, making it 1.70 m (previously 1.65 m) and by 10 cm for women making it 1.65 m (previously 1.55 m). Common performance thresholds for both sexes are also provided while, in the shot put, female candidates are asked to use the 7.275 kg ball used by men. The Ombudsman concluded that: \u2022 The asymmetrical and disproportionate increase in the lower acceptable height of candidates is a clear case of direct discrimi- nation against women, in breach of European law (Directive 2002/73/EC 1 ) as well as national law (law 3844/2006), which cannot be justified. \u2022 The establishment of a common performance threshold for men and women regarding physical tests constitutes indirect discrimina- tion against women and is also in breach of European law (Directive 2002/73/EC) as well as national law (law 3844/2006). The discrim- ination on account of sex lies in the fact that a seemingly neutral provision of common thresholds does not take into account the fact that men and women have different physical abilities and puts female candidates at a sig- nificant disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis their male colleagues. That is not justified sufficiently as objective criteria serving a legitimate pur- pose such as safeguarding the proper func- tioning of the armed forces and cannot be considered as an appropriate, effective or necessary measure for achieving that pur- pose (criterion of proportionality). \u2022 For the same reasons, the requirement that female candidates use the same 7.275 kg ball used by men is also a case of indirect dis- crimination. To further clarify the issue, the Ombudsman had requested the views of the Hellenic Olympic Committee and the Hel- lenic Association of Amateur Athletics, both organisations having a greater experience in the matter. Their reply was that \u201cin athletics there are different limits for men and women reflecting the different physical abilities of the sexes. In this respect the equipment used in competitions is also different.\u201d The Ombudsman asked the Greek General Staff to eliminate the discrimination against women by bringing back the lower acceptable height limits previously in force and by establishing new per- 1 Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employ- ment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.

The Greek General Staff replied that the establish- ment of a body type as common as possible for men and women is a mandatory requirement for the armed forces, which may enable their staff to rise up to the challenges posed first by their training and later by peace or wartime operations. The reply also says that the lower acceptable height limit was not established arbitrarily but in conjunction with the newly introduced criterion of body mass indica- tor (BMI). The Greek General Staff notes that the issues raised by the Ombudsman could not be dealt with at the time since the official invitation regard - ing the examination for admission to the military academies and officer cadet schools for the year 2009-2010 had already been issued. The reply ended with a commitment to reconsider the issue in the light of the Ombudsman's findings after the pre - liminary examinations were held.

He has addressed his remarks and suggestions to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development on numerous occasions, with the aim of drawing the attention of the competent authorities to the need to use EU aid most effectively. The Ombudsman monitors, inter alia, agri-environ- mental payments from EU funds. In September 2009, the Ombudsman submitted his recommenda- tions in this regard to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. The Ombudsman also addressed the question of compliance with the rules of legal drafting when introducing the implementing act on the afforesta- tion premium financed from EU funds, emphasis - ing in particular the need to observe the lex retro non agit principle. The non-retroactivity principle, as the Ombudsman pointed out in his address to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of 10 September 2009, is universally acknowledged as one of the fundamental principles governing the democratic state of law. According to this principle, the legislator and other bodies with law-making competencies should not introduce legal standards that would require application of the newly estab- lished legal standard to events that occurred before that standard became binding, and which had not previously entailed legal consequences. In this con- text, the Ombudsman indicated that good law- making should conform to the accepted standards of justice. Indeed, a citizen should have the confi - dence that the statutory law will not be changed in an arbitrary manner. The principle of trust, gover n- ing the relationships between citizens and the state, translates, as the Ombudsman has repeatedly underlined, into, among others, law-making that does not produce traps for citizens. The Ombudsman also inquired at the Minister of Justice with regard to the Natura 2000 Programme. According to the ordinance of the Minister of Agri- culture and Rural Development of 19 March 2009 on specific conditions and modes of granting financial aid under the \u201cAfforestation of agricultural land and afforestation of non-agricultural land\u201d measure included in the Rural Development Programme for 2007-2013 (Dz.U. No. 48, item 390), the aid for affor- estation is not granted for agricultural and non- agricultural land located within Natura 2000 sites. Nevertheless, as stipulated in the provisions of Arti- cle 29 of the Act of 16 April 2004 on nature conserva- tion (Dz.U. of 2009, No. 151, item 1220, as amended), the Minister of the Environment is obliged to estab- lish by ordinance a protection plan for Natura 2000 sites that takes into account the ecological character- istics of natural habitats, and species of animals and plants, for which the protection area was delimited. The Ombudsman indicated that no ordinance con- cerning this issue had been issued by the Minister of the Environment. Contact: Miros \u0142 aw Wr\u00f3blewski; m.wroblewski@brpo.gov.pl ",
        "25 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 PORTUGAL Decolonisation, right to Portuguese nationality and entry into the EU: the case of former Portuguese India History At the beginning of the 1960s, Portugal was still a colonial empire, with overseas territories in India (Goa, Daman and Diu, forming Portuguese India), Africa (Angola, Cape Verde, the current Guinea- Bissau, Mozambique, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe) and Southeast Asia (East Timor). The occupation by the Indian Union in 1961 of the territories of the former Portuguese India began the decolonisation process. Following guerrilla wars and the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, this process ended in that same year with the recogni- tion of Guinea-Bissau's independence and, in 1975, with the declaration of independence of the other colonies mentioned above. General legislative framework on nationality In this context of decolonisation, one of the funda- mental issues that had to be resolved was that of the nationality of all those who, until then, had been Portuguese citizens. As a result, Decree Law No. 308-A/75 was pub- lished in June 1975 1 . This law laid down the rule that, when formerly occupied territories became new independent states, those citizens who had been born or were domiciled there would lose their Portuguese nationality (Article 4). The main excep- tions to this rule were: \u2022 individuals born in mainland Portugal or in the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira (Article 1, paragraph 1(a)); \u2022 descendants, to the third degree inclusive (at least one great-grandparent), of an individual born in mainland Portugal or in the Azores or Madeira. As a result, except in those cases indicated and in others of lesser importance, all the inhabitants of 1 Available in Portuguese at: http://dre.pt/pdf1dip/1975/06/ 14304/00070008.pdf the new states resulting from the break-up of the Portuguese colonial empire lost their Portuguese nationality. The only way that these citizens and their descendants 2 could reacquire Portuguese nationality was through naturalisation. The right to Portuguese nationality granted to inhabitants of former Portuguese India However, Decree Law No. 308-A/75 laid down spe- cial rules for individuals born in former Portuguese India. Accordingly, in order to retain their Portu- guese nationality, these individuals simply had to declare that this was what they wanted to do (Article 1, paragraph 1(e)). In other words, any citizen born before 20 December 1961 could make this declaration and, in this way, retain their Portuguese nationality. Moreover, this same law allowed descendants to the third degree inclusive to retain Portuguese national- ity, unless otherwise declared. In practice, this meant that Decree Law No. 308-A/75 allowed Portuguese nationality to be retained, unless otherwise declared, up to the great-grandchildren of individuals born in former Portuguese India before 20 December 1961. This legislative solution therefore allowed everyone born in the former territories of Goa, Daman and Diu to hold Portuguese nationality. However, Decree Law No. 308-A/75 was repealed in 1988 3 . It must be stressed, however, that, accord- ing to the current nationality law, children of a Por- tuguese citizen born abroad enjoy Portuguese nationality (Article 1, paragraph 1(c)) of Law No. 37/81 of 3 October 1981 4 ). The combination of these rules allows any individ- ual born in former Portuguese India to indefinitely retain Portuguese nationality, contrary to what has happened in other former Portuguese colonies. As far as these are concerned, the current bone of con- tention is that only a small number of citizens are able to retain Portuguese nationality. Conversely, in former Portuguese India, it is technically the whole population who can claim recognition of original Portuguese nationality through jus sanguinis and uninterrupted continuity. 2 Except for those born subsequently on Portuguese territory. 3 Due to Law No. 113/88 of 29 December 1988 (available in Por- tuguese at: http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/1988/12/30000/51245124.pdf ). 4 Available in Portuguese at: http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2006/04/ 075A00/27762782.pdf ",
        "26 April 2010 European Union Law As a result, the Central Registration Office has received a high number of requests submitted by individuals who claim to be children or grandchil- dren of citizens born in former Portuguese India and who are therefore asking to be entered in the national civil register under the naturalisation procedure. Rise in complaints submitted to the Ombudsman This growing aspiration among inhabitants of Goa, Daman and Diu to obtain Portuguese nationality is having an impact on the Ombudsman's work. The number of complaints originating from Portu- guese-speaking countries, Macao and former Por- tuguese India has grown considerably over the last decade: from around 10 complaints in 2001 to 800 complaints in 2008 (almost all from former Portu- guese India). The most common issue in the thousands of com- plaints filed with the Ombudsman in recent years is the time taken by the Central Registration Office to complete the administrative procedures for the transcription of the birth of individuals born before 20 December 1961 in Goa, Daman and Diu. Aside from the usual difficulties in terms of evi - dence and \u2013 particularly in the case of these territo- ries \u2013 with regard to onomastics, the investigations carried out by the Ombudsman have led to the con- clusion that one of the main causes of these delays is the care taken by the Portuguese authorities in verifying the authenticity of the documents submit- ted by citizens, as these documents are used to commence the naturalisation procedure (mainly to establish the applicant's ties with former Portu- guese India), and the associated problems of docu- ment forgery. This verification is revealing the existence of many cases of fraud, particularly identity theft and multi- ple use of identities. In this context, the Ombudsman has just sent a rec- ommendation to the Justice Minister regarding the adoption of appropriate legal measures to ensure legal certainty in the reconstitution of civil status documents. These documents form the basis for the decisions of the Central Registration Office on requests for the transcription of births having occurred in former Portuguese India and are used to commence the naturalisation procedures for which the same Office is also responsible. The Ombudsman has taken into account both the problems associated with the risk of illegal immi- gration and the security requirements for entering the EU. Contact: Catarina Ventura; catarina.ventura@provedor-jus.pt FINLAND Deputy Ombudsman evaluates the procedure for compiling Instrasat statistics The complainant expressed dissatisfaction with the procedure that the Finnish customs authorities had followed in handling statistical notifications (Intra - stat 1 ) concerning EU internal trade. The Customs required that the statistical notifications be made within 10 working days of the end of a calendar month. In Finland, it is the Customs that compile statistical data on internal trade. Importers and exporters on a monthly basis notify the requisite statistical data on internal trade to the regional customs adminis- tration, which receives and inspects them. The cus- toms regional administration then sends the data to the national Customs Statistics Unit, which pro- duces Finland's official statistics on internal and foreign trade. The statistical data are also sent to the EU statistics office, Eurostat, every month. Compilation of statistical data on internal trade is based on Regulation (EC) No. 638/2004 of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3330/91 (the Basic Regulation on internal trade). In addition, the Commission issued Regula- 1 Intrastat is the system for gathering, compiling, producing and disseminating statistical data on intra-EU trade in goods. It began operation on 1 January 1993, when it replaced cus- toms declarations as the source of trade statistics within the EU. The requirements of Intrastat are similar in all Member States. ",
        "27 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 tion (EC) No. 1982/2004 to implement the above- mentioned Basic Regulation. According to Point 4 of Article 5 of the Basic Regula- tion on internal trade, each Member State organises the way in which the parties responsible for supply- ing Intrastat data provide them. To facilitate the task of these parties, the conditions for increased use of automatic data processing and electronic data trans- mission must be promoted by the Commission (through Eurostat) and the Member States. Article 6 of the Regulation provides for a reference period for the data provided, which is, as a general rule, the calendar month in which goods are despatched or arrive. The parties responsible for providing infor- mation are listed in Article 7. Point 3 of this Article states that: \u201cFailure by any party responsible for providing information to fulfil his/her obligations under this Regulation shall render him/her liable to the penalties which the Member States shall lay down.\u201d The Intrastat data to be collected are listed in Article 9 of the Basic Regulation. Article 12 of the Basic Regulation requires Member States to transmit to the Commission (through Eurostat) the monthly results of their statistics relat- ing to trade in goods between Member States no later than 40 calendar days after the end of the ref- erence month and 70 calendar days after the end of the reference month in the case of data referred to in greater detail in the Article. Section 32 of the Customs Act provides for a fine of not less than EUR 10 and not more than EUR 2 500 if delay or other inaccuracy relates to inter alia com- pilation of statistics on internal trade in the EU (Point 2). Every year, the Customs Statistics Unit drafts a timetable for foreign trade statistics. An Intrastat handbook, the contents of which include a timeta- ble for returning data is available to all on the Cus- toms website. The handbook is also sent by post to the biggest parties liable to furnish data. The South- ern District Office's Intrastat Service Point compiles data, and also sends a reminder to those parties who are required to provide data and have not made their notifications by the deadline stipulated in the handbook. The reminder gives the party required to provide data additional time to do so and informs it of the minimum and maximum amounts of the fine that is statutorily provided for as a consequence of not providing the data (EUR 10-2 500). The Customs have issued guidelines on determin- ing the size of the fine. According to the guidelines, the Southern District Office imposes a fine of EUR 100 for the first instance of negligence, and if negligence of a comparable nature recurs, the amount of the fine increases by EUR 100 each time up to a maximum of EUR 2 500. The Deputy Ombudsman, Petri J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen, evaluated the pro- cedure that the Customs had followed with respect to the deadline set for the person liable to make a notification, and concluded as follows. A Member State's obligations to supply the Com- mission with the statistical data in question are regulated by EU law, which also stipulates that companies and entrepreneurs engaged in internal trade within the EU are obliged to supply these data. By contrast, something that has been left to Member States to regulate is the deadline by which a party required to provide the data must notify the national authority and the consequences of failing to do so. The Customs Act does not contain a provision stat- ing within what period the data must be provided. Its Section 32 only regulates the reason for impos- ing a fine in that it specifies delay and inaccuracy as a ground for imposing a fine. The minimum and maximum amounts of the fine are also specified in this Section, but there are no provisions concern- ing, for example, how the amount of the fine is determined within these limits. Nor does the Act contain a delegation provision, under which the Customs could issue regulations in the matter. Each year, the Customs Statistics Unit sets a publication table in the Intrastat handbook that it publishes. The time allowed has been, at least in the period 2007-2009, 10 working days. In assessing the question posed in the complaint, i.e., whether a time limit of 10 days to supply the data to the Customs is appropriate, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that the report contains a time- table for the 2007 foreign trade statistics, which sets forth the measures that are conducted in the South- ern Customs District and the Customs Statistics Unit in processing data for each month. One of the principles of good administration is that proportionality is observed in actions. This is ",
        "28 April 2010 European Union Law expressed in Section 60 of the Administrative Pro- cedure Act, which states that official actions must be proportionate to the objective that is aspired to. Proportionality is also one of the legal principles on which EU law is founded. Whether there is enough time to achieve the objective must be taken into consideration in an evaluation of proportionality 1 . There is no reason to doubt that the deadline would be as such necessary so that the Customs can sup- ply the European Commission with the necessary data within the statutory time limit, when it is taken into account that the Customs must also take measures within the appointed period against par- ties who have neglected to supply data within the time limit for supplementing data. Nor was it dem- onstrated in the case that providing data in 10 working days, i.e., in practice two weeks, would not be possible for reasons relating to technical aspects of invoicing or another reason. By contrast, what must be assessed in the case is what the nature of the fine provided for in the Customs Act is and whether the grounds for imposing it should be provided for more precisely in national law. As is stated in the Government Bill introducing the provision, a fine can be imposed for reasons associ - ated with neglecting to provide statistical data. A fine can also be imposed for many other acts of negligence, for example in situations in which the Customs do not deem it necessary to impose a tariff surcharge as provided for in Section 31 of the Cus- toms Act. It remains unclear on the basis of the rea- soning in the Government Bill whether the fine has been designed as a coercive measure type charge along the lines of a conditional fine or as a penalty type charge. The border between a fine being a criminal law sanction or a coercive measure in character can vacillate considerably. In the recent case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, especially in relation to tax surcharges, criteria have been set for when a tax surcharge must be considered as being a criminal law sanction in character so that the guarantees of protection under the law that are pro- 1 With respect to the proportionality principle in the context of a Commission criminal sanction in relation to agriculture, see Court of Justice of the European Union judgment C-210/00, K\u00e4serei Champignon Hofmeister I , paragraphs 53-58. vided for in Article 6 in cases involving the hard core of criminal law become applicable. The Jussila vs. Finland , No. 73053/01 judgment, issued by the European Court of Human Rights on 23 November 2006, concerned a case in which a tax office had imposed a 10% tax surcharge (EUR 308) on the appellant for deficiencies in bookkeeping. The issue was that an administrative court had not agreed to the appellant's request for an oral hearing and had rejected the appeal in written proceedings. The Court of Human Rights drew a distinction between a traditional hard core of criminal law pro- cedure and other, atypical forms of criminal pro- ceedings such as administrative penalties, prison disciplinary proceedings, customs law, sanctions under competition law and penalties imposed by a court with jurisdiction in financial matters. The hard core of criminal law procedure does not fea- ture in the latter, and in these areas the require- ments of Article 6 of the European Human Rights Convention are not regarded as necessarily always being as strictly in effect (Point 43 of the judgment). On the basis of the so-called Engel criteria, which were also outlined in the Jussila case, it is possible to regard a fine as being punitive in nature. This would set greater requirements with respect to how the fine and the grounds for imposing it must be provided for in an act so that the principle of legal- ity in criminal cases as required by Section 8 of the Constitution and the guarantees or protection under the law that are enshrined in Section 21 are taken mutatis mutandis into consideration. On the other hand, the Court of Justice of the Euro- pean Union took the view in, for example the K\u00e4serei Champignon Hofmeister I case, that the conse- quences specified for inaccuracy of applications for export subsidies were in character measures decided on in order to achieve the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy. The consequence is a separate administrative instrument, which is an inseparable part of the subsidies system. The inten- tion is to ensure flawless management of the Union's public funds. Thus the Court of Justice of the European Union took the view that the sanction was not of a criminal law nature. In light of what has been outlined in the foregoing, the character of a fine either as a coercive measure ",
        "29 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 type administrative sanction or as a payment of a punitive nature remains open to interpretation. Even if the sanction were to be considered adminis- trative, it does not follow from this that regulation concerning it should not be required to meet the same demands, which flow from the principle of legality in administration and the prerequisites for restricting fundamental rights, with respect to the preciseness and clear limits of the regulations. It has been pointed out in the above-mentioned Court of Justice decision that private legal subjects do not lack protection under the law because of the nature of the sanction. The Court has found in this respect that a sanction, also one other than under criminal law, can be imposed only in a case where there is a clear and unambiguous legal basis for it and that it must be in accordance with the proportionality principle (Paragraph 52). A deadline for providing data has not been set in the Customs Act. The Act's provision on determin- ing the amount of the fine is very loosely formu - lated and the grounds for determining the amount are not regulated at all. Nor does the Act contain a delegation provision relating to them. On the basis of what is outlined above, the Deputy Ombudsman took the view that the deadline for supplying statistical data on internal trade within the Union and the grounds for determining the amount of the fine should be provided for in the Customs Act. He informed the Ministry of Finance of this opinion for possible measures. Decision by the Deputy Ombudsman, Petri J\u00e4\u00e4skel- \u00e4inen, issued on 18 June 2009, case No. 3373/4/07. Contact: Riitta L\u00e4nsisyrj\u00e4; riitta.lansisyrja@eduskunta.fi THE UNITED KINGDOM PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMAN Cold Comfort An investigation by the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman, Ann Abraham, into administration of the 2005 Single Payment Scheme by the Rural Payments Agency found that the failure of the scheme took a direct personal and financial toll on farmers in England. The report of her investigation, entitled Cold Com- fort , was laid before the UK Parliament under sec- tion 10(3) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. The report sets out the results of Ms Abra- ham's investigation of two representative com- plaints about the administration of the Scheme by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA), part of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The complaints Ms Abraham investigated complaints from two farm- ers, Mr W and Mr Y. Their complaints were broadly typical of 22 other complaints about the same matters referred to her by members of parliament. Mr W complained that RPA had failed to provide him with an entitlement statement and make pay- ments under the Single Payment Scheme in accord- ance with statutory EU deadlines. He said this caused his farm to sustain financial loss and caused him stress and his family hardship. Mr Y complained that RPA had not given him an accurate set of digital maps, despite repeated cor- rections and amendments. He needed the maps to apply for funding under the Environmental Stew- ardship Scheme. He alleged that RPA's failure to provide an agreed set of maps delayed his Single Payment Scheme payments and prevented him from joining the Environmental Stewardship Scheme. He said this caused him financial loss and anxiety and stress. The Single Payment Scheme Established in 2001, RPA is England's paying agency for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) schemes. In June 2003, the EU started a fundamental reform of the CAP and RPA became responsible for imple- menting this in England. The Single Payment Scheme was part of these reforms and brought sev- eral EU agricultural support schemes into one. The Single Payment Scheme was based on land area and replaced the previous production-based sys- tems of farm subsidy. Farmers in England receive about \u00a31.6 billion a year in subsidies from the Single Payment Scheme. ",
        "30 April 2010 European Union Law In England, Defra ministers decided to use the dynamic hybrid model and to implement the Single Payment Scheme from the earliest possible date of 1 January 2005. Dynamic hybrid meant it would base early payments on historical payment levels, which had been based on production. Payments would move gradually to being based on land area. The statutory timetable The terms of the Single Payment Scheme are set out in EU legislation and the legal framework derives from Council Regulation (EC) 1782/2003 1 . The pre- amble to the 1290/2005 Regulation says that Com- munity aid should be paid to beneficiaries in good time, so that they may use it efficiently. It notes that a failure to comply with the payment deadlines could create serious difficulties for the beneficiaries. Article 28 of Council Regulation 1782/2003 pro- vides: \u201cPayments shall be made once a year within the period from 1 December to 30 June of the fol- lowing calendar year.\u201d For the 2005 Single Payment Scheme this meant a payment window of 1 Decem- ber 2005 to 30 June 2006. The requirement of the Regulations is, in effect, to make 96.14% of the year's Single Payment Scheme payments on time, that is, by 30 June of the following year. The investigation The Ombudsman upheld Mr W's and Mr Y's com- plaints, concluding that RPA had been maladminis- trative and that both farmers had suffered an injus- tice as a result. RPA was unable to keep its timetable for handling the digital mapping of land or for making payments to farmers. But RPA continued to tell farmers that it would keep its payment timeta- ble, when it knew, or should have known, that the timetable was increasingly unrealistic. In the lan- guage of the Ombudsman's Principles, RPA failed to get it right, to be customer-focused, or to be open and accountable. The Ombudsman also found four types of injustice sustained by Mr W and Mr Y. They had lost the opportunity to plan their affairs with adequate information to hand; worry about the Single Pay- 1 Council Regulation (EC) 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain sup- port schemes for farmers. ment caused them stress and anxiety; they incurred costs that they would otherwise have avoided and let go opportunities because they did not have access to funds when they needed them. The Ombudsman's recommendations Ms Abraham made five recommendations for putting right the injustice sustained by Mr W and Mr Y and any similar injustice sustained by the other 22 complainants. These included a recommen- dation for a personal, written apology to be sent to Mr W and Mr Y acknowledging the maladministra- tion that had occurred and the injustice that resulted. She recommended payments of \u00a33 500 and \u00a35 500 to Mr W and Mr Y respectively, in recognition of the stress, heartache, effect on their ability to make informed decisions and the cumulative financial impact that flowed from the maladministration. The Ombudsman said that RPA should keep in mind the general findings she had made and be guided by the Ombudsman's Principles, including the Principles for Remedy. She recommended that RPA carefully and critically review the complaints made by the 22 other individuals listed in the report and should then provide any individuals who it finds have sustained such injustice with an appro - priate remedy (financial or otherwise). Defra's response Defra have not accepted the Ombudsman's recom- mendations in full. They have apologised to Mr W and Mr Y and have made a consolatory payment, by way of apology, of \u00a3500 each, to both Mr W and Mr Y and have said that they will do the same in respect of any of the 22 others where RPA's reviews reveal that maladministration has occurred. They declined to pay compensation for financial loss. They also said that they could not accept the Ombudsman's findings that RPA failed to be open and accountable. Select committee hearing Defra's response to the Ombudsman's findings was the subject of a parliamentary select committee hearing at the end of January this year. In her open- ing words to the committee, Ms Abraham said that it was clear that there were systemic issues relating to service design and systems for handling com- plaints within RPA. She said she thought it unlikely that, if Defra were to pay the amounts recom- ",
        "31 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 mended in her report, it would \u2018open the floodgates\u2019 for other complaints, because if farmers had not complained about their experience at the time, they were unlikely to be successful in doing so now. In their evidence to the committee, Defra's Perma- nent Secretary, Dame Helen Ghosh, and Chief Exec- utive, Tony Cooper, said that they accepted the Ombudsman's findings of maladministration and that they had offered a consolatory payment of \u00a3500 to Mr W and Mr Y to compensate them for worry and distress. But they argued that the Ombuds- man's recommendations regarding financial rem - edy were based on Defra's failure to meet targets and that because those targets were not legally binding, there was no obligation on them to pay. The Ombudsman stated that her Principles meant that there were different components to the total sum recommended, which was a remedy for injus- tice resulting from maladministration, not redress for failure to meet targets. In response, members of the committee observed that Defra did not under- stand the Ombudsman system. Conclusion Problems with the 2005 Single Payment Scheme are not new \u2013 they have been in the UK public domain for some time. What the Ombudsman's report adds are her findings of what happened to individuals who sustained an injustice due to RPA's mistakes. In her report, Ms Abraham concluded: \u201cImportant principles are at stake here. My view is that an appropriate remedy should be forthcoming where injustice has been suffered as a consequence of maladministration by a public body. ... it also sad- dens me that a public body refuses to provide rela- tively modest financial remedy for substantive injustice to people whose complaints have been referred to the Ombudsman by members of parlia- ment and which the Ombudsman has upheld fol- lowing an independent investigation.\u201d It is a rare occurrence for the UK government to refuse to accept all of the Ombudsman's recommen- dations in full and for the Ombudsman to lay a spe- cial report before parliament on that basis. This report is only the sixth such special report laid before parliament by the Ombudsman since the creation of the Ombudsman's Office in 1967. Fast and Fair? A new report by the Parliamentary Ombudsman, Ann Abraham, has highlighted severe delays and poor administration by the UK Border Agency. The Agency is responsible for handling applications for asylum, immigration and nationality and applica- tions for residence cards. Ms Abraham\u2019s report, Fast and Fair? , includes eleven case studies that reflect the large number and wide range of complaints referred to the Ombudsman by Members of Parliament. The Agency have consistently generated a number of complaints to the Ombudsman. In the first nine months of 2009-10, the Ombudsman received 478 complaints about the Agency and reported on 33 investigations, of which 97% were upheld in full or in part. In the report, the Ombudsman said: \u201cThe Agency have made significant progress in recent years towards clearing their backlogs, although progress has been slow because of the scale of the problem. They need to make sustained and consistent progress towards their commitment to meeting their service standards, clearing existing backlogs and avoiding them in future \u2013 because the implications of them not doing so are serious and far-reaching, both for the individuals caught up in the system and for society as a whole. Given the scale of the problem, there can be no short term fix, and the resolution will need to be founded on clear and consistent priorities, sup- ported by good forward planning and adequate resources. I hope that the lessons to be learnt from this report will also be of benefit to the Agency as they continue on their journey to improved cus- tomer service and complaint handling\u201d. One of the cases featured in the report is that of Mrs N, who applied for a residence card as the spouse of a European Economic Area citizen. Background to the complaint In February 2006 Mrs N (a Romanian national) entered the UK on a visitor's visa. In August, she applied for a residence card on the basis that she was the spouse of a Dutch national employed in the ",
        "32 April 2010 European Union Law UK 1 . She also supplied evidence of her husband's identity, nationality and employment, as well as a copy of their marriage certificate. The UK Border Agency contacted Mr N's employer and found out that his employment had ended in August 2006. In November, the Agency wrote to ask Mrs N for evidence that her husband was still employed in the UK. They incorrectly wrote to the main address on Mrs N's application form and not the return address she had given. Mrs N was in the process of moving house at the time, and did not receive the Agency's letter. Having received no reply to their letter, the Agency refused Mrs N's application in January 2007 on the basis that they could not be satisfied that her husband was exercis - ing his right to work in the UK. Mrs N immediately wrote to ask the Agency to reconsider their decision to refuse her a residence card, and enclosed evidence that her husband had a new employer. The Agency should have treated Mrs N's letter as a reconsideration request and made a fresh decision within one month. Instead, they forwarded Mrs N's file to the removals unit. No further action was taken on the case until May 2007, when the removals unit wrote to Mrs N at her old address. This letter \u2013 which said that Romania had become a member of the European Union on 1 January 2007 and Mrs N was no longer subject to immigration control \u2013 was returned to the Agency marked \u2018not known at this address\u2019. They then put Mrs N's file into storage and took no further action. In July, Mrs N emailed the Agency to ask them to progress her case. They treated this letter as a com- plaint and passed it to the relevant business area. However, the email was never linked to Mrs N's file and she did not receive a substantive response. 1 A residence card confirms the holder's right of residence in the UK under European law. What our investigation found Mrs N's application for a residence card was subject to a catalogue of errors by the Agency. They wrote to her at the wrong address and failed to identify her letter of January 2007 as an appeal and incor- rectly sent her file to the removals unit, where it was incorrectly put into storage. They also failed to respond to the substance of Mrs N's complaint about their handling of her case and so missed the opportunity to put right their earlier mistakes. These errors amounted to maladministration. The injustice to Mrs N The delay in receiving Mrs N's residence card caused her problems once she moved home and delayed her applying for new employment. While we had no basis for saying that the maladministra- tion led to actual financial loss, the Agency's mis - takes did cause Mrs N inconvenience and uncer- tainty, and their failure to respond to her complaint compounded her sense of hopelessness in her deal- ings with them. How we resolved the complaint We upheld Mrs N's complaint. The Agency agreed that they had mishandled her case. They accepted that it was likely that she would have supplied the information they had asked for in November 2006, and were satisfied that she would have qualified for the residence card at that time. The Agency decided Mrs N's residence card application and sent her card to her in April 2008. They apologised to Mrs N for their mishandling of her case, and made her a con- solatory payment of \u00a3300. We considered that those actions fully remedied the injustice to Mrs N.

        "33 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 4. the woRK of ombuDsmen & similaR boDies EUROPEAN OMBUDSMAN Helping citizens contact the European Network of Ombudsmen Background In autumn 2004, the European Ombudsman announced that he would explore the feasibility of creating a single telephone number across the EU for people wishing to contact the European Network of Ombudsmen. The aim was to ensure that citizens with a grievance could access the relevant national or regional ombudsman quickly and effectively. With a view to following up on this idea, members of the European Ombudsman's staff met with European Commission officials responsible for the Europe Direct Contact Centre (EDCC) 1 . The EDCC consists of a free telephone number, an e-mail reply service and interactive web assistance. The service helps people find answers to their questions about the EU, offering information on all sorts of subjects, including citizens' rights. It can provide direct responses to general enquiries and, in the case of more detailed questions, signpost people to the best source of information and advice at EU, national, regional and local levels. The main purpose of the meeting, which took place in April 2005, was to discuss the Commission's expe- rience in setting up the service. The meeting revealed that significant human and financial resources were involved. (The average annual running costs are now EUR 4 million.) The challenges involved in set- ting up the service were also discussed. The Ombudsman's interactive guide Prior to the meeting, it had been suggested that, as an already existing service, the EDCC could be used as a filter mechanism for questions relating to the work of 1 A full description of this service is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/europedirect/index_en.htm the European Network of Ombudsmen. Similar arrangements are in place with SOLVIT, for example. At this time, within the European Ombudsman's Office, discussions were beginning on the idea of an interactive guide on the Ombudsman's website that would help complainants find the right address first time around. The guide was to contain infor - mation on a range of complaint-handling bodies, including national and regional ombudsmen within the Network. It was felt that any agreement with Europe Direct, which had the aim of redirecting callers to members of the European Network of Ombudsmen, should ensure maximum synergies between the interactive guide and the EDCC. The idea was that the EDCC operators in Brussels (now 40 in total) should be encouraged to use the interac- tive guide to help citizens whose problem might be solved by an ombudsman in the Network, or by the European Ombudsman. The Ombudsman's interac- tive guide was launched as part of his new website on 5 January 2009 2 . Following a number of further exchanges between the European Ombudsman's staff and Commission officials responsible for the EDCC, the conclusion reached was that, rather than setting up a new structure, it would be quicker, cheaper and more effective to build on the existing role of the EDCC as a central entry point for the general public. This also reflects the ongoing efforts to develop the EDCC's role in signposting to specialised networks. One such network is of course the European Net- work of Ombudsmen, which plays an important role in helping citizens obtain their rights under EU law, and in identifying and tackling systemic prob- lems concerning the application of EU law at national level. 2 It is worth mentioning that, in its first year of operation, over 26 000 users have obtained advice through the interactive guide. ",
        "34 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies To ensure that the EDCC is fully informed about the role of the European Ombudsman and the European Network of Ombudsmen, a presentation to the EDCC took place in Brussels on 23 October 2009. Moreover, the European Ombudsman addressed the Annual General Meeting of the Europe Direct Net- work in Tallinn on 23 September. This offered a good opportunity to announce his wish to strengthen co- operation with Europe Direct. The Ombudsman also wrote to Commission Vice-President Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, as the Commissioner responsible for Communication and for Inter-Institutional Relations, to ensure high level support for enhanced co- operation on this issue. Finally, the Ombudsman agreed to provide the EDCC with information and materials about the European Network of Ombuds- men, so that individuals can be correctly signposted, where appropriate. All of the aforementioned initiatives are key in reaching out to citizens and helping them to enjoy their rights under EU law. These initiatives should also help raise awareness about the role of the Euro- pean Network of Ombudsmen in helping citizens make full use of their rights.

After the pro- tection of persons restricted in their freedom became part of the ombudsman's mandate in 2006, followed by powers to propose disciplinary pro- ceedings with presiding judges and deputy presid- ing judges of courts in 2008, equal treatment and protection against discrimination has meant yet again another significant increase in the Ombuds - man's competences. Protection against discrimination The Anti-Discrimination Act also enables the Ombudsman to deal with private law issues and provide assistance, even against private companies. However, this applies only when there is suspicion of discriminatory conduct. In all other areas, the Ombudsman's mandate continues to apply to the bodies of state administration. Since 1 December 2009, anyone who feels discrimi- nated against may seek assistance from the Ombudsman. The latter will provide particularly methodological assistance to victims of discrimina- tion. He will firstly evaluate the case to determine whether discrimination may actually have taken place. The victim of discrimination will be advised on how to proceed, who to turn to and how to lodge a proposal for the commencement of proceedings on grounds of discrimination. If the person dis- criminated against decides to lodge an action with a court with a view to claiming termination of the discriminatory conduct, provision of adequate sat- isfaction or even compensation for the harm incurred, the Ombudsman may assist him/her in obtaining evidence. The Ombudsman will also carry out research and, on the basis of the results of the research, issue rec- ommendations on discrimination-related issues. Equal access to municipal flats One of the first areas the Ombudsman will concen - trate on will be the rules for the allocation of munic- ipal flats. It follows from a number of complaints that the Ombudsman received in the past that the rules for the management of flats often include con - ditions that are not in conformity with the law and are even of a discriminatory nature. Some appli- cants for municipal flats are excluded beforehand. Up to now, the Ombudsman could only initiate supervision over and inspection of the independent competence of municipalities by the Ministry of the Interior, but was not able to inquire into complaints independently. If the Ministry carried out the inspection, the illegal or discriminatory rules were subsequently eliminated in the specific cases. Now the Ombudsman can not only directly review the rules for the allocation of flats and request elimina - tion of illegal conditions, but he may also assist anyone who is discriminated against in access to a municipal flat, for example in preparing an action. Discrimination in employment Discrimination is illegal in virtually all types of employment and at all stages of labour law relation- ",
        "35 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 ships, whether in relation to vacancies, the conclu- sion of a contract, promotion, transfers of employees, training or notice of termination of employment. Labour law relationships are an area where the Ombudsman regularly encounters discrimination complaints. He therefore expects that most of the complaints within the new mandate will fall within this area. Up to now, the Ombudsman has not been able to enter into the employee-employer relationship. He could only refer the complainant to the area labour inspectorates and labour offices and only then deal with the procedures and activities of these authori- ties. Now the Ombudsman may deal with the con- duct of any employer if anyone claims to have been discriminated against. The Ombudsman may check if the employer has proceeded in accordance with the law, and if he ascertains that discrimination has occurred, he will recommend the most suitable steps to the complainant. If the complainant decides to take action and request not only termination of the discriminatory conduct, but also, for example, compensation for the damage incurred, the Ombudsman may assist him/her in obtaining evi- dence of the discriminatory conduct. The Ombudsman has recently seen cases where the area labour inspectorates did not carry out inspec- tions consistently. In addition, the person who had lodged the complaint about discrimination was advised only generally that the inspection had been carried out and no breach of the labour code had been ascertained. The complainant did not learn at all whether the inspection had dealt with the claimed discrimination. The inspectorates justified the aforementioned procedure by claiming that the provision of information, even on non-demonstrated discrimination, would cause the employer's rights and interests to be infringed. The Ombudsman does not share this view and draws attention to the right of the complainant to be advised as to whether the inspection concerned the claimed discrimina- tion and whether the latter was demonstrated. In addition, it was not clear from the files that the Ombudsman requested in these cases whether and how the inspectorates had inquired into the dis- crimination. With the new competence, the Ombudsman will therefore monitor the work of labour inspectorates and labour offices much more intensely than before. He will verify whether they consistently apply their legal competences in labour law and whether they actively detect and prosecute dis- criminatory conduct. An eye on age The Ombudsman has chosen discrimination based on age as one of the main topics for the year 2010. Ageism is one of the most frequent causes of une- qual treatment in labour law relationships. Through information and research, the Ombudsman will therefore focus on raising awareness of discrimina- tion and on developing people's ability to identify discriminatory conduct. In this manner, it will be possible to gradually break down prejudice and stereotypes that result in discrimination on grounds of age. Disciplinary proceedings An amendment to the Courts and Judges Act has broadened the mandate of the Ombudsman in the area of public court administration. Now, the Ombudsman has the right to propose commence- ment of disciplinary proceedings against any pre- siding judge or deputy presiding judge of a court. In the case of presiding judges and deputy presid- ing judges of courts, a disciplinary violation con- sists of a breach of the duties associated with their office. The proposal for an action must contain a description of the conduct, justification and proofs of the misconduct. If fault is proven in the discipli- nary proceedings, a reprimand may be imposed on the presiding judge or deputy presiding judge in the most favourable case or, as an extreme measure, s/he may be recalled from office. Up to now, the Ombudsman's mandate has applied to the presiding judges and deputy presiding judges of courts as the bodies of state administration of courts in connection with the handling of com- plaints about delays in court proceedings, inappro- priate behaviour of judges or infringement upon the dignity of court proceedings. The Ombudsman ascertains in specific complaints how the presiding judge of the court handled the complaint about delays and how s/he provided for elimination of the delays. The new mandate enables the Ombuds- man to deal with the activities of the presiding judges and deputy presiding judges of courts not only in connection with specific cases, but also to ",

Den- mark was one of the first countries to implement such legislation, as an act on access to public admin- istration files was passed as early as 1970. However, the debate on access to public archives was a long winded exercise, going all the way back to the mid- 1800s, when the present parliamentary constitution replaced absolute monarchy. The debate arose because Sweden had a very long tradition of trans- parency, starting with the tryckfrihetsforordningen (Freedom of the Press Act) of 1766. The first Danish Freedom of Information Act was amended in 1985 but this was more a case of adjustments brought about by the introduction of the first Danish Public Administration Act at that time. The amendments were thus more a question of legislative drafting and bringing the act up to date. In 2002, the Danish government appointed a public disclosure commission which was given the task of preparing a report with recommendations for a new freedom of information act. The overall aim should be to \u201cextend the act's basic principle of openness and democratic control of the public administration\u201d. At the same time, the Commission should \u201cadapt legislation to present day conditions, also in relation to the development that has taken place vis-\u00e0-vis, among others, state companies, out- sourcing, digitalisation and new and changed pub- lic administration co-operation structures\u201d. In other words, the government recognised that time was running out on the Freedom of Information Act, which at that time dated back to a little over 30 years earlier. The Commission was made up of 22 members, consisting of representatives from public administration, the media, universities, the Danish Institute for Human Rights and from youth and adult education associations. The Parliamentary Ombudsman, Hans Gammeltoft-Hansen, was appointed Chair of the Commission. In November 2009, the Commission submitted a report on a new freedom of information act. The report contains a review of the existing legislation's practice, deliberations on a long range of subsidiary problems, and a proposal for an entirely new act. Extensions to the transparency principle The main goal, to extend the transparency princi- ple, has been met, as 26 recommendations were made to extend the citizens' right to disclosure. The most important aspect in this context is the pro- posal to extend the transparency principle from the traditional public administrative bodies to also include a number of private institutions receiving financial support from public funds, to the two associations handling the interests of the local authorities and regions vis-\u00e0-vis the state, to com- panies of which the state owns more than 75%, and to private companies in as much as they make deci- sions on behalf of public administration. As a new addition, it is proposed that citizens have a right to demand print-outs of information from public data- bases, provided this can be done through simple routines. The report suggests various ways of making access to information more efficient. The state authorities have a duty to register outgoing and incoming mail in a specific way; there is a proposal for a trial intro - duction of mailing lists; and a general duty is imposed on the authorities to ensure that the trans- parency aspect is safeguarded to the widest possi- ble extent when electing, implementing and devel- oping new IT solutions. Add to this the proposed extension of the principle, already included in the existing legislation, that a public authority has a duty to consider the possibil- ity of compliance with a request even though it is within the law to refuse: the principle of increased access to public records. According to the report, a duty shall be imposed on public authorities to establish websites and use them to provide information about their function and activities, just as the Ministry of Justice shall be obligated to establish and run a website \u2013 a trans- ",

Contrary to existing law, the report gives applicants the right to choose in what form they want infor- mation, including as an electronic file. In addition, the authorities' time to comply with or refuse a request is reduced from 10 to 7 working days. Fur- thermore, the report proposes that the applicants' possibility to appeal against refusals be improved on a number of points. Restrictions of the principle of free access to public files Experiences with the current Act have on some points caused the Commission to restrict the right of access to information. As a new addition, it is pro- posed that a public authority in very special cases may refuse or restrict disclosure if the request neces- sitates the use of a disproportionate degree of resources. It is proposed to exempt from the princi- ple a number of data and documents, which are today included in the right to information in order to protect the political decision-making process. Among other things, it is proposed that communica- tions between the government and individual mem- bers of parliament in connection with legislation and other, similar, political processes to a certain extent be exempt from the right to disclosure. This last restriction in particular was the subject of long and difficult discussions in the Commission, and no con - sensus was reached on this point, as a large minority (9 members) dissented. And it is no surprise that precisely this part of the report has invoked criticism in the press following its publication. Enforcing compliance with the Act As cited in the introduction, legislation concerning the citizens' right of access to public information exists in many countries. The report provides a detailed description of the legislation in other coun- tries and of international rules on the subject. The Commission has only to a limited degree included experiences from other countries; you might say that Danish legislation is so well-established and has given rise to so much national debate that it has been difficult to break away and consider entirely new solutions. Therefore, it has not been discussed whether or not to introduce an information com- missioner or a similar national authority to func- tion both as an appeals body and as a proactive player in the transparency arena. At one point, the Commission debated the introduction of a national appeals body but that idea was abandoned. Instead, the report contains new rules on the possibility of appealing against a refusal of disclosure. The exist- ing rules (that the appeal must follow the same pro- cedure as the underlying case) are maintained, but have been tightened in that there should now only be one administrative appeals body, that an appeal must be lodged through the originating public authority, and that appeals bodies shall have 20 working days to consider the appeal. It is presumed in the explanatory notes and in the Act's provisions regarding a transparency portal that the Parliamentary Ombudsman is still expected to have a central position, both as a moni- toring and as an appeals body for transparency.

Article 11 of the state constitution guarantees the right of everyone to present his/her submissions to the representative assembly. The Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate established the office of the Ombudsman in May 1974 to deal with these submissions. Mr Galle has called on the citizens of Rhineland- Palatinate to keep making use of their right of petition. Ombudsman in favour of e-petitions in Rhineland-Palatinate Ullrich Galle, Ombudsman of the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate and President of the Euro- pean Ombudsman Institute (EOI), welcomed the decision of the SPD (Social Democratic Party) group in the Rhineland-Palatinate state parliament ( Land- tag ) to back the introduction of public e-petitions in Rhineland-Palatinate. As Ombudsman of the federal state of Rhineland- Palatinate and President of the EOI, Mr Galle has already been campaigning vigorously for several years for a more robust petition system. The e-petition would strengthen the system and, he believes, would be a milestone in the history of public petitioning. It represents an entirely new way for people to exercise the right of petition that belongs to every woman and every man. \u201cThe e-petition is the right response to developments in the 21 st century,\u201d said Mr Galle, \u201cand it also serves to strengthen democracy\u201d. In his annual report for 2007, Ullrich Galle had referred to the benefits of e-petitions, calling for their introduction in Rhineland-Palatinate. Since then, he has stepped up his efforts to promote the spread, not only to all the German L\u00e4nder but also throughout Europe, of this innovative e-petitions scheme, which is already being operated success- fully by the Petitions Committee of the German Bundestag. On the occasion of Mr Galle's re-election as President of the European Ombudsman Institute in Florence on 5 October 2009, the general assembly unani- mously agreed to support his efforts to that end.

The parents were generally recipients of income support or jobseekers' allowances under the Hartz IV package of labour reforms. Their assump- tion was that they would be exempted from paren- tal contribution, since they were unable to pay nur- sery fees from their low income unless they made unreasonable cuts in their expenditure on items such as food and clothing. The source of this problem was a statutory provi- sion introduced in 2005 by the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein, which allowed districts and municipalities to take 85% of the basic rate of income support and similar benefits into account when setting the threshold for payment of the parental contribution towards nursery education. The practical effect of this provision was that recipi- ents of income support or jobseekers' allowance were liable, in principle, for a parental contribution. Where they had two or more children at nursery school, the monthly fees could quickly mount up to more than EUR 100. Before 2005, the contribution threshold was set at the basic rate of income support. This meant that parents receiving welfare benefits were generally exempt from nursery fees. The amendment to the law was supposed to save districts and municipali- ties millions in anticipated increased costs arising from the fact that a change in welfare legislation with effect from 1 January 2005 had abolished most lump sum subsistence grants and, by way of com- pensation, had increased the standard rate of income support by about 16%, from EUR 296 to EUR 345 per month. The local authorities feared that this would make more families eligible for reduced or even zero rates of parental contribution towards the cost of nursery education. In point of fact, the new arrangement did not increase the dis- posable income of welfare recipients, because it put the onus on them to create reserves for purchases of ",
        "39 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 items such as clothing, furniture, learning materials and household equipment and appliances. The state parliament of Schleswig-Holstein was aware of this problem and decided to assess the impact of the lower contribution threshold by 30 June 2005. According to the findings of this assessment, it was not possible to confirm that the non-introduction of the 85% rule would actually have generated mil - lions in extra costs, as had been feared. Nevertheless, the parliament of Schleswig-Holstein did not rescind the reduction in the contribution threshold, and the 85% threshold still applies today. In the Ombudsman's opinion, this arrangement is conceptually untenable. Her view is based chiefly on the fact that expenditure on child care is not factored into the formula used by the federal legislature to set the standard rate. For this reason, she has been criti- cising the 85% rule since 2006. She believes that it was extremely unwise to lower the contribution threshold below the minimum socially and culturally accept- able subsistence level. Against a backdrop of mount- ing pressure, caused in part by the rising cost of liv- ing, on families with young children in particular and of an increasingly acute problem of child poverty, this particular burden on families that are already in straitened financial circumstances can no longer be tolerated. For this reason, in her annual report for 2008, she called on the state parliament of Schleswig- Holstein to repeal the provision in question. Happily, in September 2009, the state parliament of Schleswig-Holstein finally adopted a resolution call - ing on the state government to reach agreement with the authorities of the districts and municipali- ties with a view to restoring the full standard rate of income support as the basis for the setting of income thresholds as soon as possible. The Ombudsman welcomes the fact that the same resolution also calls for agreement to be reached on a means of establishing a uniform graduated welfare structure throughout the federal state no later than the start of the 2010/2011 nursery-school year, for it is high time that the patchwork of diverse arrange- ments in Schleswig-Holstein was abolished and that the political authorities finally exercised their respon - sibility to ensure equivalent living conditions.

The Ombudsman, Silvia Liebaug, has pre- sented her activity report for 2009 to the President (Speaker) of the Thuringian Landtag , Birgit Diezel. During the reference period, a total of 654 submis- sions were made to the Ombudsman. The portfolio to which the largest number of people's concerns related was that of social affairs, families and health, for which 130 submissions were received. About half of the submissions were made in person at the Ombudsman's surgeries. The others were made either in writing or by telephone. Public demand for information and advice remained high at the surgeries held both at the Ombudsman's office in Erfurt and in the districts and municipali - ties of Thuringia. With a highly specialised and refined legal and administrative system nowadays, people often lack or have lost the confidence to rec - ognise legal ramifications and to appropriately and competently act. In this situation, they find it extremely helpful to be able to ask questions face to face and obtain advice. The Ombudsman intends to maintain and perhaps even expand her schedule of fortnightly surgeries. In the 2009 reference period, a total of 31 local sur- geries were held. The case files show that these ses - sions have resulted in satisfactory outcomes.

Nelson Mandela once described ",
        "40 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies the Convention as \u201cthat luminous living document that enshrines the rights of every child without exception to a life of dignity and self-fulfillment\u201d. 193 countries have ratified the Convention, making it one of the most ratified conventions on human rights. This is also evidence of the universal com- mitment to the protection of the rights of the child. Estonia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. Despite the fact that the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been binding for Esto- nia for more than 19 years, there still is no inde- pendent national human rights institution special- ised in the rights of children in Estonia. Without such a specialised institution, it is difficult to pro - mote and ensure the implementation of the Conven- tion in full. The Chancellor of Justice of Estonia and the NGO Estonian Child Welfare Union have acknowledged the need for a children's ombuds- man in Estonia and have initiated a series of discus- sions at different levels about the establishment of the institution in Estonia. In May 2009, the Legal Committee of the Estonian parliament held a ses- sion to discuss the matter. The aim of this article is to shed light on the current situation and the results of the latest discussions about establishing a children's ombudsman in Esto- nia. As many other countries around Europe are also considering the establishment of the institution, the Estonian experience might be useful to know. Obligation to establish a national human rights institution In its General Comment No. 2 (2002), the Commit- tee on the Rights of the Child notes that Article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges signatory countries to \u201cundertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognized in the present Convention\u201d. Independent national human rights institutions (NHRIs) are an important mecha- nism for promoting and ensuring that the Conven- tion is implemented. In addition the Committee on the Rights of the Child considers the establishment of such bodies a commitment made by signatory parties upon ratification, to ensure that the Conven - tion is implemented and to advance the universal realisation of the rights of the child. According to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the estab- lishment of national institutions to promote and ensure the implementation of the Convention is an obligation for all signatory countries. Without a national monitoring institution, there is a risk that the principles and values set out in the Convention might not be realised. When acknowledging the need to establish an insti- tution to promote and ensure implementation of the Convention, the question of whether to create a sep- arate institution or to give the task to a broad-based NHRI that includes a specific focus on children arises. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has accepted both choices saying in its General Com- ment No. 2 that the Committee is happy about the growing number of specialist independent human rights institutions for children, ombudspersons or commissioners for children's rights that have been established in a large number of signatory coun- tries. But the Committee has noted in the same com- ment that in those countries where resources are limited, consideration must be given to ensuring that the available resources are used most effec- tively for the promotion and protection of human rights, including children's, and in this context development of a broad-based NHRI that includes a specific focus on children is likely to constitute the best approach. A broad-based NHRI should include within its structure either an identifiable commis - sioner specifically responsible for children's rights, or a specific section or division responsible for chil - dren's rights. Estonia's choices All the parties that have been present at discussions on the establishment of a children's ombudsman in Estonia have agreed on the need for such an institu- tion. But at the moment, there is no final decision yet on whether to establish a new institution only specialising in the rights of the child or to give the mandate of a children's ombudsman to the Chancel- lor of Justice. The institution of the Chancellor of Justice of Esto- nia with its combined competences is quite unique internationally. The Chancellor of Justice combines the function of a general institution for petitions and guardian of constitutionality. Besides the con- stitutional review and the functions of an ombuds- man, the Chancellor of Justice is also entrusted with carrying out conciliation proceedings to settle dis- crimination disputes. Since February 2007, the ",
        "41 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 Chancellor of Justice is the national preventive mechanism against torture and inhuman and degrading treatment in Estonia. By exercising these closely related tasks, the Chancellor of Justice is able to protect the fundamental constitutional principles such as human dignity, democracy, rule of law and social state. So, Estonia has chosen to develop a broad-based NHRI by assigning additional tasks to the Chancellor of Justice. Estonia has chosen to develop one broad-based NHRI instead of establish- ing several institutions with narrower mandates, mainly because of limited resources and the size of the country (whose population is about 1 340 000). Through this model of a broad-based NHRI, the Chancellor of Justice can assess laws or regulations made by the parliament, government, ministry or local government, and determine whether they are in conformity with the Constitution and whether they guarantee fundamental rights. As to the protection of the rights of children, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has listed types of activities which NHRIs should carry out in relation to the implementation of children's rights, in light of the general principles of the Convention. According to the Committee, NHRIs should: \u2022 undertake investigations into any situation of violation of children's rights, on complaint or on their own initiative, within the scope of their mandate; \u2022 conduct inquiries on matters relating to chil - dren's rights; \u2022 prepare and publicise opinions, recommen - dations and reports, either at the request of national authorities or on their own initia- tive, on any matter relating to the promotion and protection of children's rights; \u2022 keep under review the adequacy and effec - tiveness of law and practice relating to the protection of children's rights; \u2022 promote harmonisation of national legisla - tion, regulations and practices with the Con- vention on the Rights of the Child, its optional protocols and other international human rights instruments relevant to chil- dren's rights and promote their effective implementation, including through the pro- vision of advice to public and private bodies in construing and applying the Convention; \u2022 ensure that national economic policy-makers take children's rights into account in setting and evaluating national economic and devel- opment plans; \u2022 review and report on the government's implementation and monitoring of the state of children's rights, seeking to ensure that statistics are appropriately disaggregated and other information collected on a regular basis in order to determine what must be done to realise children's rights; \u2022 encourage ratification of or access to any rel - evant international human rights instru- ments; \u2022 in accordance with Article 3 of the Conven - tion requiring that the best interests of chil- dren should be a primary consideration in all actions concerning them, ensure that the impact of laws and policies on children is carefully considered from development to implementation and beyond; \u2022 in light of Article 12, ensure that the views of children are expressed and heard on matters concerning their human rights and in defin - ing issues relating to their rights; \u2022 advocate for and facilitate meaningful par - ticipation by children's rights NGOs, includ- ing organisations comprising children them- selves, in the development of domestic legislation and international instruments on issues affecting children; \u2022 promote public understanding and aware - ness of the importance of children's rights and, for this purpose, work closely with the media and undertake or sponsor research and educational activities in the field; \u2022 in accordance with Article 42 of the Conven - tion, which obligates signatory countries to \u201cmake the principles and provisions of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike\u201d, sensitise the government, public agen- cies and the general public to the provisions of the Convention and monitor ways in which the state meets its obligations in this regard; \u2022 assist in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of, research into and integration ",
        "42 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies of children's rights in the curricula of schools and universities and in professional circles; \u2022 undertake human rights education which specifically focuses on children (in addition to promoting general public understanding about the importance of children's rights); \u2022 undertake legal proceedings to vindicate children's rights in the country or provide legal assistance to children; \u2022 engage in mediation or conciliation before taking cases to court, where appropriate; \u2022 provide expertise in children's rights to the courts, in suitable cases as amicus curiae or intervener; \u2022 in accordance with Article 3 of the Conven - tion, which obligates signatory countries to \u201censure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protec- tion of children shall conform with the stand- ards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision\u201d, undertake visits to juvenile homes (and all places where children are detained for reform or punish- ment) and care institutions to report on the situation and to make recommendations for improvement; \u2022 undertake such other activities as are inci - dental to the above. At the moment the Chancellor of Justice already ful- fils many of the above-mentioned tasks. For exam - ple, the Chancellor of Justice has undertaken inves- tigations into situations of violation of children's rights on the basis of complaints and also on his own initiative, inquired into matters relating to chil- dren's rights, prepared and publicised opinions, recommendations and reports on his own initiative on different matters relating to the promotion and protection of children's rights, undertaken visits to juvenile homes (and all places where children are detained for reform or punishment) and care insti- tutions and reported on the situation and made rec- ommendations for improvement; kept under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice relating to the protection of children's rights and made suggestions and recommendations for improvement where needed. The advisers to the Chancellor of Justice have given lectures on chil- dren's rights at reform schools. But there are many tasks of the children's ombuds- man that are not fulfilled by the Chancellor of Jus - tice nor any other institution in Estonia at the moment. For example, there is no institution that is responsible for ensuring that the views of children are expressed and heard on matters concerning their human rights and in defining issues relating to their rights. The Chancellor of Justice does not advocate for and facilitate meaningful participation by children's rights NGOs, including organisations comprising children themselves, in the develop- ment of domestic legislation and international instruments on issues affecting children nor pro- mote public understanding and awareness of the importance of children's rights and, for this pur- pose, work closely with the media and undertake or sponsor research and educational activities in the field. The Chancellor of Justice also does not under - take legal proceedings to vindicate children's rights in the country or provide legal assistance to chil- dren, nor does the Chancellor participate in court hearings, except for cases of constitutional review at the Constitutional Court. So in the current situation, there are many impor- tant functions of a children's ombudsman that are not performed by any institution in Estonia. At the moment, the Chancellor of Justice of Estonia does not have the mandate nor the financial and human resources necessary to fulfil all these tasks. So the question of whether to give the Chancellor of Justice the mandate and the necessary resources to perform the task or to create a completely new institution specialised only in children's rights arises. Considering all the pros and cons, and taking into account the size of Estonia and the choices made so far, it would be better to give the mandate of a chil- dren's ombudsman to the Chancellor of Justice. This choice would be in conformity with Estonia's model of a broad-based NHRI that has proven to be effi - cient so far. Giving the mandate to the Chancellor of Justice would also help to avoid confusion that might arise due to overlapping competences of a general ombudsman and a children's ombudsman. There are already a number of competent employ- ees at the Office of the Chancellor of Justice that have a lot of experience in protecting the rights of children and also carrying out monitoring visits to juvenile institutions. The Chancellor of Justice has ",
        "43 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 also established considerable authority in Estonian society that helps to make his voice heard. As there is already a well-functioning system of supporting services and also the necessary office space for new employees at the Office of the Chancellor of Justice, giving the Chancellor of Justice the mandate would also be more efficient in terms of financial resources, which is an important factor in the current economic situation. There are of course also challenges to face in giving the mandate of the children's ombudsman to the Chancellor of Justice. For example, balancing the functions of the children's ombudsman with the other functions of the Chancellor of Justice. But I am convinced that it is possible to overcome this chal- lenge by creating a separate unit at the Office of the Chancellor of Justice that would deal exclusively with fulfilling the tasks of a children's ombudsman. But as I mentioned before, the decision-making competence in this matter belongs to parliament and there is no final decision yet. So both alterna - tives are still possible: giving the Chancellor of Jus- tice the mandate of a children's ombudsman or establishing a new institution. My hope is that the decision will be made as soon as possible and that all the tasks of a children's ombudsman would be fulfilled in Estonia in the very near future.

After examining 805 cases of gender-based violence, including deaths and assaults in and outside the home, an extensive multidisciplinary team led by Dr Juan Antonio Cobo, a forensic scientist and Director of the Insti- tute for Forensic Medicine in Aragon, has concluded that none of the models used to analyse and combat domestic violence can accommodate every aspect of each individual case. This conclusion has paved the way for \u201cGuidelines for combating gender-based violence\u201d, a report entrusted by the regional Ombudsman, Fernando Garc\u00eda Vicente, to Dr Cobo and a 36-strong team of forensic scientists, psychologists, social workers, teachers and legal specialists. In the absence of a model capable of encapsulating the reality of gender-based violence as a whole, the research proposes several approaches: \u2022 creating specific models for risk groups, including immigrants; \u2022 devising specialised models according to the authority or policy area involved in society's response; \u2022 designing models offering a proactive response which is dependent upon how far the victim acknowledges and communicates her situation; \u2022 and finally, introducing a response model based on detecting the causes of loss of effec- tiveness and efficiency in order to focus spe - cifically on those problematic areas, i.e. avoidance models. As far as specific models are concerned, the report proposes, inter alia, a model for immigration based on differential data that show that gender-based vio- lence is more common among this group. With 2000 as the base year, the risk of foreign women suffering mistreatment is six times higher than for Spanish women; the length of the process whereby an assail- ant becomes a murderer is shorter for immigrants: an average of three years compared to the Spanish pop- ulation's eight to 12 years; the influence of alcohol in gender-based violence is much greater than it is among the Spanish population, as is the mortgage as a serious domestic issue related to women taking responsibility for expenditure. Finally, the analysis of cases shows that women adapt better and more quickly to the host society, to some extent as a result of their ability to find work in the services sector. From the point of view of the specialised models whose characteristics depend on the type of social response involved (health, educational, judicial, social, etc.), Dr Cobo's report advocates the adminis- tration of a justice model because of this area's par- ticular relevance to the response of society to gender- based violence. For the appropriate decisions to be ",
        "44 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies taken, this model must consider both the previous history of the threat posed by assailants in and outside the home, and the imbalances and life changes to which they are subject, the way in which the views that they have of the couple and their obsessions develop and factors of contain- ment, if any. Thirdly, the report addresses the need for further research into proactive models which are more accessible to victims, based on data which show that silence underlies most assaults and deaths. The data examined persistently show that 80 to 88% of victims have had no access to the social response. Greater efforts must therefore be made to break the silence, and to that end the report pro- poses the construction of models to facilitate vic- tims' access to the social response, such as the denuncia puente (conditional or provisional com- plaint), which would allow women to opt to con- tinue the domestic relationship while at the same time activating protection mechanisms, and the drafting, dissemination and presentation of a self- help manual such as the one that can be down- loaded from the regional Ombudsman's website ( www.eljusticiadearagon.es ). Finally, and in response to the question \u201cwhy have we been unable to prevent an assault on a woman or her death at the hands of her partner?\u201d, the report promotes an \u201cavoidance model\u201d designed to identify which link in the chain fails when the victim needs to be protected. The study identifies six broken links, or six differ - ent routes to assaults or death: the victim makes a complaint but the protection fails, which means that the response must be improved; the victim makes a complaint but the \u2018system\u2019 fails in assess- ing the risk, with the result that risk prediction measures must be developed; the victim makes a complaint but subsequently changes her mind and blocks the social response, which means that her individual risk awareness must be targeted; the victim, aware of the risk deriving from previous assaults, does not make a complaint, making it necessary to find out why the victim has distanced herself; the victim, despite being assaulted, is not aware of the risk, which means that approaches geared towards greater risk awareness must be intensified. Finally, in some cases there appears to be no history of aggression but there is a first assault which may be fatal. In this last group of cases, the study stresses the need to work on assessing latent risks. Ombudsman suggests compensation for stockbreeders whose stock is attacked by vultures The Ombudsman of Aragon, Fernando Garc\u00eda Vicente, has suggested that stockbreeders whose stock is attacked by vultures be compensated. The sugges- tion stems from a complaint lodged by certain stock- breeders against the Department for the Environ- ment's refusal to grant aid in the form of compensation for losses arising out of attacks by vul- tures on stock. These attacks are a result of the spread of these creatures and of the difficulty they have in finding food now that animal carcasses can no longer be left out in the countryside for them to feed on. Stock has been attacked by carrion birds in recent years, leading to the death of many animals and considerable financial loss to their owners. The increase in the network of feeding systems in Aragon is a consequence, among other things, of the need to provide guaranteed food for these birds and thereby avoid attacks on stock. Unlike other autonomous communities such as Navarre, La Rioja or Cantabria, Aragon has no spe- cific legislation requiring the government of the autonomous community to compensate for damage to stock caused by vultures. However, draft Law No. 10/07, approved by the parliament of Aragon's Committee on the Environment on 2 March 2007, on compensation in the event of damage caused to livestock by carrion birds, reads as follows: \u201cThe parliament of Aragon urges the government of Aragon to speed up the introduction of the facilities provided for in the plan covering feeding systems for carrion birds and to submit, as a matter of urgency, legal formulae to regulate the valuation and compensation procedure for damage caused to livestock by carrion-eating birds in Aragon\u201d. In light of the above, the regional Ombudsman has suggested that the Committee on the Environment should put forward the legal formulae to regulate the valuation and compensation procedure for dam- age caused to livestock by carrion-eating birds in Aragon.

        "45 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 Ombudsman in favour of lighter books, lockers and campaigns on how to carry schoolbags In view of families' repeated concerns regarding the weight pupils have to carry in their schoolbags due to the quantity of books and other school things they need, the regional Ombudsman, Fernando Garc\u00eda Vicente, has announced a suggestion in which he urges the Department of Health of the Government of Aragon to run an information cam- paign in schools on the correct way to carry a schoolbag to avoid back problems. The Ombudsman has also asked the Department of Education to promote, to the extent permitted, the publication of books which are lighter for pupils to carry and to provide spaces where they can leave school things they do not need at home. According to the experts, if the weight carried in a schoolbag is more than 10% of the weight of the person carrying it, back problems may ensue. A weight in proportion to the size of the child, on the other hand, may help to strengthen their muscles, provided the schoolbags have particular character- istics, such as a semi-soft frame, wide straps or a belt that can be fastened at the waist. They must also be placed correctly on the back, at the right height and using both straps, amongst other con- siderations. From the point of view of the characteristics of school materials, Fernando Garc\u00eda Vicente suggests that the government of Aragon should favour the publication of textbooks geared more towards what pupils have to learn, and with a flexible design that allows them to take only the part of the text that will be used in class. Finally, the Ombudsman urges the education authorities to consider the installation of lockers or the provision of space in schools where pupils can leave the materials they will not need at home each day. Contact: Carmen Rivas, Press Officer; crivas@eljusticiadearagon.es OMBUDSMAN OF NAVARRE Citizens' proposals for improving public services In line with its governing law, in 2008 the ombuds- man institution of Navarre introduced a new ser- vice to take up and support initiatives devised by citizens themselves to improve the public services provided by public authorities and their institutions. The Ombudsman has always felt that public prod- ucts and services represent the counterpart of the subjective public rights recognised in the legal sys- tem. These do not exist or are merely high-minded yet ultimately vacuous declarations if the executive has not underpinned them with an effective public service that brings them to fruition and perpetuates them with sufficient human, material and budget - ary resources. This is plainly evident in areas as important to the social and democratic rule of law as health, education, social security, social assist- ance, public security, a treasury which collects funds according to the real economic ability of each taxpayer, public works, the environment, etc. This new function has paved the way for a high degree of public participation, plus positive accept- ance of the Ombudsman's proposals both to local authorities and to parliament. Academic thinking has described this as a function of anticipation, rec- ommendation and consultation, which supplements the original function of defence and reaction that ombudsmen have traditionally held since the 19 th century, which is restricted to responding to sub- missions or taking ex officio action against breaches of public rights and freedoms. The addition of this second major function is intended to bring about a direct improvement in the level of protection of legally established rights and freedoms, something that necessarily involves affirming such subjective rights before the public authorities. Article 1 of the law of Navarre is clear on this: \u201cThe Ombudsman of Navarre is the High Commissioner of the parliament of Navarre, and is thereby author- ised to defend and enhance the level of protection afforded to the rights and freedoms enshrined by the Constitution and the Ley Org\u00e1nica de Reinte- graci\u00f3n y Amejoramiento del R\u00e9gimen Foral de Navarra (Law on the Reintegration and Enhancement of the Autonomous Regime in Navarre) [\u2026]\u201d. ",
        "46 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies A total of 113 proposals were brought before the regional Ombudsman in 2008 and 2009, an undeniably significant number in proportion to the community's population, and one that reflects the success of the ini - tiative and its positive reception. Most proposals con- cern issues related to the provision of social services and social housing, while education, health protection, the management of local community organisations, the treasury, environmental protection, improvement of public works and services, etc., are also common areas of concern. The regional authorities and parliament have warmly welcomed the proposals of the Ombudsman, who thus mediates between citizens' aspirations and the sensi- tivity of the public authorities, which are made aware of people's concerns and initiatives through the High Commissioner. The media has also paid a great deal of attention to these citizen-generated proposals. Submissions that have been accepted by local authori- ties in Navarre or which have led to amendments to the laws of the regional parliament include the follow- ing: \u2022 amendment of the rules governing the alloca - tion of social housing so that the award criteria focus primarily on financial capacity and proven need, and facilitate access to ownership or rental of housing by the social groups most in need; \u2022 amendment of the rules governing inheritance and gift tax to introduce a reduced rate levy on the inheritance of dwellings jointly owned by siblings; \u2022 amendment of the law on personal income tax to apply, within the respective minimum per- sonal allowances, a specific reduction in the event of the international adoption of a minor; \u2022 introduction of measures to improve the work/life balance of local government staff; \u2022 the possibility of splitting the use of school text - books on a quarterly basis to reduce the weight carried and supported each day; \u2022 the stimulus provided by administrative mod - ernisation projects for creating electronic com- munications between the authorities and citi- zens, including: a general electronic register, electronic application forms, digital identifica - tion of citizens and recognised electronic signa- ture, electronic tracking of procedures, elec- tronic communications, electronic bulletin boards and electronic notifications; \u2022 establishment of measures to support associa - tions involved in preventing HIV/AIDS and improving the quality of life of sufferers; \u2022 amendment of the housing law to establish mechanisms enforcing the obligation to install lifts in old buildings in which people with reduced mobility live, including the possibility for local authorities to expropriate the space required if the property association fails to observe its duty to update specific installations to make accessibility effective; \u2022 in line with provisions laid down by various international organisations, the application of various measures to guarantee the rights of people who are detained incommunicado; \u2022 amendment of the rules governing the adop - tion of minors to eliminate some of the require- ments concerning the upper age limit of per- sons seeking to adopt, particularly where the minor is an adolescent; \u2022 application by the regional police in Navarre of national and international provisions on the custody of detainees and their physical integ- rity and personal safety. This police force has taken various measures to this effect, such as recordings in all premises in which they have custody responsibilities; guaranteeing detain- ees' rights to dignity and privacy, together with the confidentiality of communications with lawyers; medical care, medical recognition and transfer to health institutions where necessary or advisable; qualified assistance for detainees with information on their right to appoint a legal representative who may attend police pro- ceedings, and notification to the bar associa - tion. All in all, citizens' proposals to the Ombudsman in respect of the executive and legislative authorities are yet another expression of participatory democracy \u2013 the right of citizens to participate actively in public affairs through institutions whose titles include the laudable word \u2018Ombudsman\u2019.

        "47 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 ITALY OMBUDSMAN OF THE MARCHE REGION Unaccompanied foreign minors While the problem of unaccompanied minors is not often highlighted by the media, it is an urgent prob- lem with which the various institutions are having to deal, often with inadequate means and resources. Certain border municipalities such as Ancona (due to the port) are having to make huge economic investments which are out of proportion to the funds available for the task. Added to this, unfortunately, are the evident diffi - culties of co-ordinating the regulations and prac- tices applied by the various administrative and judicial authorities which have jurisdiction in the matter. The regrettable result is that further bureau- cratic obstacles are placed in the way of the already complex policies and measures to ensure the neces- sary and proper reception and protection of foreign unaccompanied minors. This is an area in which our authority (the Ombudsman of the Marche region) has been active, not only in receiving and promptly remedying complaints about failures in the administrative system, but also mediating between the various institutions involved so as to ensure that, as far as possible, the initiatives set in motion are consistent. The majority of cases concern minors from regions where socio-political situations, such as wars, have already left deep psychological scars on these young people which are difficult to heal. For this reason, the European and state institutions cannot leave local authorities to tackle this issue by themselves, because each individual case has to be handled on its merits, bringing in the appropriate expertise, and the problem cannot be reduced to one which can be resolved solely by an economic approach. There is a marked increase in this trend because every year, interminable conflicts and civil wars bring about hundreds of new dramas involving minors. In 2008, 329 minors entered the Marche region, 195 (59.2%) of whom were Afghans, 28 (8.5%) Alba- nians and 28 (8.5%) Senegalese, in addition to other nationalities in increasingly small numbers; they were predominantly male, 311 (94.5%), and aged between 15 and 17 (80.2%) with a large proportion aged 17 (41.6%). Hopefully European countries will adopt measures to improve co-operation in order to prevent these young people from falling prey to criminal organi- sations and paying huge sums for an arduous jour- ney of hope where their very lives may be at risk. Institutions need to implement all the measures needed to guarantee the overriding interests of minors in all circumstances, and additionally, in Italy, to provide, where necessary, for adequate forms of protection. The problem of unaccompanied foreign minors is therefore a particularly delicate one and needs to be tackled with an eye on the young age of the persons concerned, their special needs and particular char- acteristics, which are connected with the complex dynamics of migration, often with significant reper - cussions. For this reason, international and national bodies also need to tackle these issues in minors' countries of origin with the necessary resources and expertise. On the basis of the New York Convention, the rights of minors should also be an expression of the self- determination of the child (age permitting), guaran- teeing the child special safeguards and care on the part of the state.

        "48 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies the Turin newspaper La Stampa on 31 December 2009. Following complaints from citizens and an increas- ing number of press articles in the last few months of 2009 about growing dissatisfaction with the local rail transport service, the Ombudsman of the Pied- mont region intervened to try to find a practical solution to the problems that users face. The information was patchy as the complaints lodged by citizens related to isolated incidents; the Ombudsman's action was therefore geared towards gaining an overview of all the problems. The first step in the investigation headed by the regional Ombudsman's office was to draw up a full list, while bearing in mind the need for prompt action, of the shortcomings complained of by users, in the light of the EU and domestic law obligations incumbent upon the regional administration and the train service operator. By assembling material from a variety of sources, i.e., daily newspapers, television news items, reports by users (including staff of the Ombudsman's office who use the service) as well as representatives of ad hoc committees set up in the region, the Ombuds- man's office compiled a dossier which is constantly being fleshed out with new facts and incidents revealing shortcomings which infringe rights, in particular those of the less protected members of society, especially older people and people with various disabilities. The problems have been summarised as follows: \u2022 delays and lack of compatibility of timetables with commuters' work and study require- ments in particular; \u2022 problems relating to recent price increases (transparency, appropriateness and accurate calculation of those increases) and to the renewal of season tickets (whose previous advantages for commuters have not been extended); \u2022 problems relating to the safety of trains, track and infrastructure equipment or rolling stock, structural aspects of the service and also train hygiene; \u2022 problems brought about by overbooking and the resulting public order issues; \u2022 problems with refunds for delays; \u2022 guarantee of effective compliance with pub - lic service requirements. Making reference to the complex and detailed legis- lation on the matter, the Ombudsman's office requested documented and reasoned clarification from the Piedmont Regional Transport Authority, the railway operator \u2013 Trenitalia SpA \u2013, the railway infrastructure operator \u2013 RFI SpA \u2013, the National Rail Safety Agency and the Provincial Governor of Turin (regarding public order), listing various bones of contention, including among others: contractual regulation of tender relations in the public rail transport service, compliance of the rail transport network with Regulation (EC) No. 1307/2007 of 23 October 2007 currently in force, the criteria used to determine the price increases charged to custom- ers, timetables and ways of making the service pro- vided compatible with users' normal work or study times, problems with train overbooking, obsolete rolling stock and the run-down condition of many railway stations and its repercussions in terms of law and order, and train and track safety with refer- ence to current national, EU and international legislation. This action, taking into account not just the regula- tory framework and the tangle of responsibilities in relation to the rail transport service but also the powers of the Ombudsman, who is not able to take coercive measures, has focused on fostering dia- logue between the various parties involved, with a view ultimately to achieving an amicable settlement of the whole range of disputes, including potential disputes, brought about by the condition of the local rail transport network. The Ombudsman has indicated his willingness to act as mediator, thereby enabling the various bodies concerned to work together without any obstacles being created, with a view to serving the interests of users and ensuring proper operation of the service at a fair cost. The Ombudsman's office has tried to employ a modus operandi which, making use of the powers conferred on him by law, helps to promote and bring about a voluntary process geared towards achieving a concrete solution to the problems, at the ",

A communication arrived recently from the Pied- mont Regional Transport Directorate and the Regional Transport Authority indicating, among other things, their willingness to attend a meeting with the other stakeholders, co-ordinated by the Ombudsman. This indicates that perhaps the other parties involved will also make themselves available, so that the Ombudsman can carry out his third party \u2018mediation\u2019 function. Publication of the positions of the various stake- holders and the roundtable discussion that the Ombudsman proposed is an indication that the process is transparent, effective and fair, and could pave the way for a resolution of the current con- flicts. It could also ultimately meet public expecta - tions of good public administration. In terms of our customary practice in Italy, these are innovative methods, shaped by the nature of the institution of the Ombudsman and its culture, methods which are designed to foster co-operation among public authorities and to encourage citizens to take part in public affairs. All this can represent a victory for \u2018civilisation\u2019 in relations between citizens and administration. This is a wager we need to win. Contact: Antonio Caputo, Ombudsman; difensore.civico@consiglioregionale.piemonte.it LITHUANIA Ombudsman asks Parliament to address Constitutional Court on the law on religious communities and associations The Synod College of the Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church (LERC) complained to the Seimas (Parliamentary) Ombudsman, Albina Radzevi \u010d i \u016b t \u0117 , about the Ministry of Justice's decision to register the Synod Unitas Lituaniae of the Lithuanian Evan- gelical Reformed Church as a legal entity. After investigating the complaint, the Ombudsman asked parliament to address the Constitutional Court to determine whether the Ministry's decision con- formed with the law. \u201cAfter analysing many documents, hearing experts' opinions and examining the legal system that regu- lates the activities of religious communities and associations in Lithuania in detail, I concluded that the Ministry of Justice's principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the church was a declara- tive one. This is because, in reality, the Ministry has tried to evaluate the Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church and determine whether it was in danger of splitting, and if that were the case, in what way\u201d, stated the Ombudsman. Representatives of the LERC requested the Ombuds- man to investigate the actions of the officials of the Ministry of Justice when, following its decision of 9 December 2002, the new legal entity \u2013 Synod Uni- tas Lituaniae of the Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church \u2013 was registered. The Synod received a registration certificate of a legal entity confirming its status as a traditional religious asso - ciation. For this reason, the representatives of the LERC asked the Ombudsman to request the Minis- ter of Justice to cancel its decision to register the Synod as a legal entity and to suspend its activities. After the Ombudsman inquired at the Ministry of Justice about the matter, the Ministry informed her that the application by the Synod to be registered as a legal entity was received on 19 October 2002. The application indicated that the four traditional Evan- gelical Reformed religious communities had broken away from the LERC and founded a new commu- nity and elected its executive body \u2013 the Consistory. The Ministry of Justice said that by formalising the rights of a legal entity for the newly created com- munity, the Ministry established rather than vio- lated the constitutional principle of the separation of the church and the state, and the principle of state non-interference in the internal affairs of religious communities. It was also noted that the decision was made in accordance with the laws and docu- ments received. According to the Ombudsman, if the Ministry was determined to follow the non-interference principle, it should have waited until the Evangelical ",
        "50 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies Reformed Church had settled the conflict itself before making a decision. In Ms Radzevi \u010d i \u016b t \u0117 's opinion, by hastily formalising a new religious com- munity, the Ministry of Justice intervened in the internal affairs of the church and thus created the precondition for breach of the non-interference principle. \u201cIn any case, this is an unprecedented situation, and the problem, which has not been solved for seven years, can now be handled only by the Constitu- tional Court\u201d, said Ms Radzevi \u010d i \u016b t \u0117 . Under the current law, the state acknowledges nine traditional religious communities and associations in Lithuania, i.e., Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, Evangelical Lutherans, Evangelical Reformed, Orthodox, Old Believers, Jews, Sunni Muslims and Karaites. \u201cAccording to explanations by the Constitutional Court, the list of traditional religious communities and associations established under Article 5 of the law, rare exceptions aside, cannot be extended. Meanwhile, taking Article 10, Paragraph 2 of the same law as a base, it is not clear what other new traditional religious communities and associations, not established under Article 5, may be granted the rights of legal entities by the Ministry of Justice. This shows that the provision set out in Article 10 Paragraph 2 creates opportunities for the registra- tion of new traditional religious communities and associations without any legal basis, and therefore potentially contradicts Article 43 of the Constitu- tion\u201d, said the Ombudsman. Law on pharmacies exists but is not effective The Seimas (Parliamentary) Ombudsman, Romas Valentukevi \u010d ius, upon his own initiative, investi- gated the situation whereby Lithuanian pharmacies refuse to accept past-expiry-date medicines and to utilise them. The Ombudsman concluded that even though the law on pharmacies stipulates that past- expiry-date medicines have to be utilised, it is not followed and the institutions in charge of collecting and controlling the said medicines are failing in their duties. \u201cPast-expiry-date medicinal products are especially dangerous for human health as they are one of the main causes of poisoning. When these products are not utilised but simply thrown into waste bins, by the roadside or any other random place, they not only pollute the environment, but also pose a risk to human and animal health and life. Therefore, col- lection of these products from the general public must be addressed quickly and efficiently\u201d, said Mr Valentukevi \u010d ius. The law on pharmacies requires pharmacies to accept medicinal products for disposal. When the Ombudsman asked the Minister of Health to explain why pharmacies refuse to collect medicinal prod- ucts and utilise them, the Minister responded that handling waste was a time-consuming process, and that pharmacies were not reimbursed costs which, as pharmaceutical waste holders, pharmacies them- selves have to bear. Therefore, it can be presumed that pharmacies do not accept pharmaceutical waste on the grounds that the government has not set up a system that regulates the reimbursement of expenses incurred for collecting pharmaceutical waste from the general public. The Minister of Health has stated that once the rules regulating the collection and handling of phar- maceutical waste from the general public and reim- bursement of pharmaceutical waste holders have been passed, all the legal provisions on pharmacy governing the collection of pharmaceutical waste from the general public will be implemented. \u201cThis raises the question of why it has not been done before. The law on pharmacies, which requires pharmacies to accept past-expiry-date medicines from the general public free of charge, has been in existence for many years. However, it still does not work and is not followed\u201d, concludes the Ombuds- man. He is astonished that public authorities that drew up the law and submitted it to parliament for approval forgot to establish a procedure for the col- lection and utilisation of past-expiry-date medicines. It should be mentioned that in Lithuania, pharma- ceutical control, i.e., supervision of pharmacies in the collection, handling and transfer of pharmaceu- tical waste to a pharmaceutical waste handling com- pany, is the responsibility of the State Medicines Control Agency under the Ministry of Health. \u201cHowever, this institution remembered that it is authorised to control the activities of pharmacies only when I asked its officials to provide the necessary ",
        "51 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 information. Only then did they find out that the only company licensed to collect pharmaceutical waste from pharmacies in Lithuania was no longer operating and that pharmaceutical waste was not being collected. Thus, the state does not have a single competent com- pany for collecting and handling pharmaceutical waste and performing pharmaceutical control, and the State Medicines Control Agency does not even know about that\u201d, said Mr Valentukevi \u010d ius. In the course of his investigation, the Ombudsman also took an interest in the collection and utilisation of past-expiry-date veterinary medicines. \u201cAfter evaluating the legislation in place, it became clear that the legal framework regulating the pre- vention of placement of unsafe veterinary medi- cines on the market, their timely removal and pre- vention against their use to treat animals is sufficient. However, with no system for the utilisa - tion of expired veterinary medicinal products, it cannot be claimed that the problem is solved\u201d, according to Mr Valentukevi \u010d ius.

In the framework of the project, which involved 10 legal advisers, the Ombudsman investigated and con- cluded 33 cases. Seventeen cases were pending in January 2010. Although the Ombudsman initiated most of the cases, he also investigated some of them on the basis of written complaints. The findings with regard to individual transport mainly relate to: \u2022 parking and road toll issues (barred fee and toll claims, duplicated penalties, lack of certainty in the legislation, e.g., absence of a single parking system in Budapest); \u2022 inconsistency of the different authorities involved in intra-EU vehicle acquisition; \u2022 police practice concerning the \u2018zero toler - ance\u2019 principle with regard to motorists driving under the influence of alcohol; \u2022 legislation and police practice concerning the objective liability of vehicle operators (the Ombudsman initiated a petition at the Constitutional Court, and the chal- lenged law was found to be partly uncon- stitutional); \u2022 state liability with regard to the insol - vency of vehicle insurance; \u2022 police discriminating between foreign and Hungarian motorists; \u2022 legislation and police practice concerning the operation and driving of micro cars. The findings with regard to public transport mainly relate to: \u2022 the ticket control practice of local trans - port companies, fines for passengers trav - elling without valid tickets; \u2022 the ticket control practice of the Hungar - ian State Railways; \u2022 supposed faked certificates of civil ser- vants in order to obtain discounted rail- way tickets; \u2022 surcharge claims over the Budapest Transport Company's time limits; \u2022 barrier-free movement opportuni ties for persons with disabilities, non-discriminatory access to transport vehicles and the \u2018design for all\u2019 requirement in new transport projects. The most important pending case focuses on the legal nature of the fines imposed by the transport service supplier enterprises. Contact: Zsolt Hal\u00e1sz, Adviser; halasz@obh.hu ",
        "52 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS A \u2018Green Ombudsman\u2019 The Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsman) for Future Generations is a fairly new institution in Hungary. The parliament adopted the amendment to the Ombudsman Act, opening the way for the establishment of the \u2018Green Ombudsman\u2019 at the end of 2007. The office has been operating with a full staff of 35, including 19 law- yers, 2 economists, 1 engineer, 2 biologists and a medical doctor since the last quarter of 2008. The Ombudsman is a guardian of the constitutional right to a healthy environment. Similar national institutions can only be found in Canada, New Zea- land, Israel and Australia, and in Austria at regional level. The Ombudsman investigates individual complaints, comments on draft legislation and car- ries out scientific research. The wide range of issues the Ombudsman has cov- ered in his investigations, comments and policy papers include: \u2022 road construction in protected areas; \u2022 noise pollution generated by public events, industrial installations and traffic; \u2022 odour complaints; \u2022 spatial plans with negative effects on the environment; \u2022 problematic allocation of the revenue from the sale of Kyoto units; \u2022 endangerment of certain world heritage sites in Hungary; \u2022 environmental protection aspects of the Budget Act, etc. Furthermore, the Ombudsman has participated actively in the consultation procedures of several significant laws, such as drafts of the Forest Act, the amendment of the Administrative Code and the World Heritage Act. Intervention in the consulta- tion of the draft amendment to the Water Manage- ment Act was indispensable to the protection of the interests of future generations and to the prevention of irreversible damage to the environment. The adopted proposal allows exceptions from the obli- gation to reinject thermal water extracted for energy generation. The Ombudsman will turn to the Con- stitutional Court to seek an annulment of the adopted amendment. In the third field of his activi - ties, i.e., strategic research, the Ombudsman has launched two projects on climate protection and small sustainable communities. The Ombudsman Act provides the Ombudsman with strong powers to protect the environment. In general, the Ombudsman may investigate adminis- trative procedures that have been completed but as an exception \u2013 where the execution of the adminis- trative decision is likely to cause irreversible dam- age to the environment \u2013 ongoing procedures may also be subject to his investigation. In the course of his investigation, he may request information from anyone, inspect documents, and have access to any premises. As a result of his investigation, the Ombudsman may call on the competent authority to take protective measures relating to the protec- tion of the environment, issue general recommenda- tions and initiate supervisory proceedings. The Ombudsman may even call on the organisation damaging the environment to terminate its activity and restore the environment. In case of an unsatis- factory reply from the organisation, he may take legal steps. His powers in international matters are also significant: he participates in the preparation of the Hungarian position on issues related to the EU, and monitors the implementation of international agreements. Promoting the principle of integration \u2013 case studies The principle of integration is one of the general principles of environmental law that the Ombuds- man must promote in his work. The principle is laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the Euro- pean Union as well in relation to EU policies and activities. Article 11 of the Treaty provides that \u201cenvironmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Union policies and activities, in particular with a view to promoting sustainable develop- ment\u201d. Similarly, the Hungarian Environmental Protection Act reinforces the above principle in so far as it requires that \u201cthe drafters of bills and other legislation and national and regional concepts related to the protection of the environment shall assess and evaluate the effects of proposed meas- ures on the environment and shall summarise them ",
        "53 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 in an assessment analysis\u201d. Two cases in the Ombudsman's activities in the field of integration stand out. The first case relates to the decision of the Transport Ministry on the closure of 1 000 kilome- tres of passenger railway lines. In the second case, the Ombudsman assessed the draft of the 2010 Budget Act from an environmental protection aspect. Legal background of the environmental assessment of laws and policies As mentioned above, the Hungarian Environmental Protection Act requires the drafters of bills and other legislation and important policies to assess the impact of these measures on the environment. The assessment must include: impact of the future law on the state of the environment, damage to the envi- ronment by omitting the measure, adequacy of national conditions of the measure, preparedness of organisations responsible for the implementation of the measure, availability of financial, organisational and procedural conditions of the implementation. The principle of integration is an effective way to prevent environmental damage. Therefore, taking environmental protection aspects into consideration when preparing a legislative proposal is a very important way of implementing prevention, the most significant principle of environmental law. Nevertheless, the assessment analysis is rarely applied. The Act on Legislation makes the general \u2013 not specifically environmental \u2013 impact assess - ment of draft legislation mandatory. However, sim- ilarly to the assessment analysis, it is not applied either due to lack of time, political predetermination of the best available alternative, etc. Omission of the impact assessment is more crucial when it comes to the environment, due to the irreversible nature of environmental damage. Therefore, the Ombudsman considers that the enforcement and promotion of environmental assessment of draft legislations are of utmost importance. Statement of the Ombudsman on the closure of passenger railway lines The closure of passenger railway lines usually sig- nificantly increases the air and noise pollution gen - erated by road traffic and the emission of green - house gases. Therefore, transformation of railway traffic is directly connected to the right to a healthy environment, which justified the Ombudsman's competence in the case. The Ombudsman's investi- gation concluded that the Ministry of Transport failed to carry out the assessment analysis prior to its decision on the closure of the railway lines. It is important to point out that the decision of the Min- istry did not appear in the form of a bill or other legislation but as a public service contract. Since this contract, or the administrative procedure leading to the formulation of the willingness to conclude this contract, might result in significant, new effects on the environment, in the Ombudsman's opinion, it must also be subject to an assessment analysis. Statement of the Ombudsman on the 2010 State Budget Bill Another good example of the enforcement of the integration principle is the Ombudsman's analysis of the 2010 State Budget Bill. In the Ombudsman's view, the bill does not support an economic model that would guarantee positive opportunities for future generations. By missing the opportunity to transform the financial regulation system in accord - ance with the environmental protection objectives, Hungary has not been among those countries that consider support for green investment as the area of strategic breakthrough that pays back in the short- term. More importantly, contrary to the above stipula- tions of the Environment Act, the government has failed to carry out a prior assessment of the environ- mental implications of the State Budget Bill. In addi- tion to criticising such a general failure, the Ombudsman has also highlighted some of the most problematic points of the draft state budget in his statement, such as ineffective application of envi- ronmental taxes, withdrawal of resources from pub- lic transportation, reduction of the subsidies to sus- tainable agricultural and regional development policy, a critical financial situation of agricultural gene banks, lack of financial support to the environ - mental administration, almost total elimination of the environmental product charge, etc. Since the response to this statement from the government was not fully satisfactory, the Ombudsman will inform the parliament of his statement in his annual report and seek further support for his standpoints in connection with strengthening the environmental elements of the state budget.

        "54 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies THE NETHERLANDS Ombudsman helps victims of identity fraud This case is about a complainant who got mixed up in an identity fraud. It all began in 2005 when he applied for a new identity card in his municipality. The courier service, via which the post delivered his card to the municipality, was robbed and his new identity card was stolen. The municipality arranged for a new card very quickly but did not inform him of the theft of his first card. The complainant only discovered later on that his first card had been sto - len when it was used for all sorts of things. In order to solve his problem, the complainant contacted various public authorities: the Ministry of the Inte- rior, his own municipality, the Chamber of Com- merce (where a new company had been registered under his name), the police and the postal services. All of them denied responsibility and pointed to the next in line. In the end, the complainant asked the National Ombudsman to help him. Abuse of identity cards has serious consequences for the person concerned. The complainant in this case had to appear before court several times for fraud, received many letters from debt collection agencies and received an urgent demand to return a power shovel that had been rented in his name but never returned. The complainant felt abandoned by all the public authorities, who only sympathised with him but did not offer any solution. The National Ombudsman took the initiative to contact all the administrative authorities concerned and together they worked out a solution. It was agreed that the complainant would have a contact person at the municipality and police station until his stolen identity card expired (in 2010). As com- pensation, he was offered EUR 15 000. The adminis- trative authorities concerned made concrete agree- ments on how to be alert to identity fraud in the future. The Chamber of Commerce for instance will now check the identity card in a special system when someone seeks to register a new company. This register contains all stolen and missing identity cards. The National Ombudsman paid special attention to victims of identity fraud and people who got into problems because of complicated bureaucratic pro- cedures in his annual report for 2008. The Ombuds- man's report states that it is common for public authorities to decline responsibility and blame one another. In his opinion, this should change in the future. The Ministry of the Interior has set up an identity fraud disclosure office for this purpose. Taking damage claims seriously It is inevitable that an organisation as large as a national public administration sometimes causes harm or damage to citizens. It may therefore not come as a surprise that public authorities regularly receive damage claims. The investigation into the payment of damages by the National Ombudsman covers the years 2006 and 2007. The investigation revealed large differences between ministries with regard to claims. They differed not only in the number but also in the nature of claims. The water department of the Ministry of Traffic and Water for instance, received almost 2 500 claims, while the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science only received five. Some ministries looked not only for a legal solution but also for a fitting one. Other minis - tries only considered a purely legal solution. In the report on the investigation, the National Ombudsman does not give his opinion on the legal- ity of claims or how they were dealt with. He only focuses on the question of whether the claims were dealt with properly or not. The Ombudsman finds it important that in these cases, public authorities choose a personal approach in the search for a solu- tion to the conflict. To do so, they should listen to the story behind the complaint and pay attention to what actually happened and, if necessary, offer apologies. This is often as important as offering financial compensation. The National Ombudsman therefore advises public authorities to avoid legal procedures as much as possible and to consider mediation an option. If there is no court procedure, public authorities should not necessarily appeal. According to the National Ombudsman, dealing properly with damage claims also means that a public authority should proactively investigate and determine whether its actions have disproportion- ately high impact on some citizens and take imme- diate action to compensate for possible damage. If the authority admits that it is liable but does not accept the amount claimed in damages, it could pay out the accepted amount. The authority could also provide citizens with information in a way that gives them an equal footing in the discussion. ",
        "55 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 Finally, the National Ombudsman points out that public authorities should not be afraid of setting a precedent if they pay damages. They should also show willingness when it is established that they have made mistakes but that the citizen has diffi - culty proving the actual damage suffered. The investigation of the National Ombudsman has resulted in a list of 15 guidelines on how public authorities should act when dealing with damage claims. Solving conflicts \u2022 The authority looks for the conflict behind a damage claim and tries to solve this problem in a fitting manner. \u2022 The authority is aware that financial com - pensation is only part of the solution. Willingness to compromise \u2022 The authority is willing to pay compensation for small claims. \u2022 The authority is willing to compromise if it is established that it has made a mistake but that the citizen has difficulty proving the damage. Avoidance of legal procedures \u2022 The authority avoids, where possible, legal procedures. \u2022 The use of legal procedures by the authority is proportionate and consistent with the identity of the citizen and the nature of the damage. \u2022 If in a final court procedure a decision is made, the authority will refrain from starting proce- dures in similar cases. \u2022 The authority exercises restraint with regard to appealing, where the judge has decided in favour of the citizen. \u2022 In case of a test trial in the public interest, the authority will reach an agreement with the citizen on the compensation of the trial costs. \u2022 If the authority is inclined to start court proce - dures and the citizen is awarded the standard damages, the authority should consider whether additional compensation should be offered. \u2022 The authority is proactive in offering compen - sation in connection with its actions for the common good that may burden certain citi- zens disproportionately. \u2022 The authority pays interest due to delays on its own initiative or on demand, without waiting for the citizen to start court procedures. \u2022 If the authority recognises its liability, but the claimed damages are considered to be too high, it will pay the admitted damages. \u2022 When a court procedure is started, the author - ity will provide on its own accord all neces- sary information. \u2022 The authority informs citizens about the best way to proceed in a damage claim. The report and the guidelines are in accordance with the aim of the government to deal with conflicts in a less legal way. The National Ombudsman extensively discussed the guidelines with the ministries and has approved them.

War veterans are a special category of people, who rightfully deserve our consideration. As an expres- sion of the gratitude the nation owes them, Law No. 44/1994 on War Veterans, and on some of the rights of people with disabilities and war widows, republished in the Official Monitor of Romania on 28 October 2002, has been adopted. ",
        "56 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies According to this law, the main rights of war veterans are: \u2022 to consider as years of service \u2013 to be taken into account when establishing retirement benefits \u2013 the time spent in war, captivity, hospitalisa- tion and medical leave, due to injuries; \u2022 certain benefits and a monthly increment, according to the period of time spent in war; \u2022 a monthly annuity for those who were awarded orders and medals for their deeds in arms; \u2022 to appropriate land to those who were awarded orders and medals for their deeds in arms; \u2022 free of charge transport for a certain number of railway, road or river travellers; \u2022 free of charge public transport in towns; \u2022 priority in the distribution and rental of accom - modation by the State Housing Fund; \u2022 the right to buy from the State Housing Fund accommodation that war veterans live in on the basis of lease agreements; \u2022 exemption from local taxes and dues, and from payment of tax on arable land of up to 5 hec- tares; \u2022 free of charge medical services and medicines; \u2022 free treatment vouchers. The task of effectively granting these rights falls upon several public authorities, i.e., the National House of Pensions and Other Social Insurance Rights and regional pension offices, the Ministry of National Defence, the Ministry of Administration and Interior, the Information Service, the Ministry of Labour, Fam- ily and Social Protection, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, county health insurance companies, county councils, local councils and town halls. The petitions that the Ombudsman has received reveal a series of problems concerning the granting of the above-mentioned rights to war veterans. As a result, the Ombudsman drew up and submitted a special report to the parliament, with recommendations and concrete suggestions for improving the situation, given that these are people who deserve respect and who, because of their age (on average over 87 years of age), can do very little to defend their rights and interests. It is Mr R from Gala \u0163 i who brought the problem relat- ing to the rights of war veterans to our attention. We were able to solve it locally. Mr R sent a petition indi- cating that he was a war veteran and that he owned one hectare of arable land in Bere \u015f ti town, Gala \u0163 i County, for which he had requested tax exemption, and which the local authority had rejected. The author- ity based its refusal on Article 284, paragraph (7) of the Tax Code, according to which tax exemption is only granted for land connected to one's residence. We ana- lysed the petitioner's situation on the basis of existing regulations on war veterans (Article 16, point e). We found that Law No. 303/2007, subsequent to the Tax Code, had modified these regulations and that there - fore war veterans benefit from the additional tax facil - ity of tax exemption for arable land up to 5 hectares. We communicated this finding to the Mayor of Bere \u015f ti town, who granted the petitioner the tax exemption he had requested. This example illustrates the philosophy of action of the Ombudsman, who places the amicable approach at the centre of his activity when settling conflicts between individuals and public authorities. Obviously, this phi- losophy is founded on the good faith of the public administration and on its willingness to correct its own mistakes. Our experience proves that this administra- tive approach prevails at least at local public authority level. On the basis of the results we obtained, we believe that through the development of relationships of mutual trust and respect, we shall succeed as a real guarantor of the rights of natural persons. Contact: Iuliana P \u0103 duraru, Expert, Galati Regional Office of the Ombudsman; curier@avpgalati.ro Restitution of property abusively acquired by the state The restitution of property abusively acquired by the state is based on the protection of the right to private property, a universally valid principle of law. Property ownership is a fundamental human right, enshrined in the Constitution of Romania and in Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which Roma- nia ratified in 1994. In Romania, the restitution of property was and still is a long and difficult process. There are diverse ways ",
        "57 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 through which local authorities seek to resolve this issue. Any breach, delay or neglect in the restitution pro cess can be interpreted as a form of violation of human rights. The restitution of property that the communist regime confiscated is even more important, consider - ing that it constitutes an indictment of communist abuses and also the moral and material reparation of these abuses. Adoption of Law No. 18/1991 on the Land Fund com- pleted incorporation of the property right in the Con- stitution. This regulatory act, which has undergone many changes and additions over the years, specifies the legal situation of agricultural and forest lands. Once in force, the law on land property became a major headache for those charged with applying it. Article 44 of the Constitution guarantees and protects ownership of property. Most cases brought to the attention of the Ombudsman relate to the difficulty of restituting land on old sites. It is often when public authorities refuse or fail to observe Article 44 of the Constitution and the Law on the Land Fund, i.e., to restore the property in question, or to provide reme- dies to the owners or their heirs, that people turn to the Ombudsman. Through mediation, the Ombudsman has helped restore private property and land to their rightful own- ers in the two cases below. Mr C and Mr V requested the competent public authorities to restore their right to private property. Since the authorities were not meeting the requests, Mr C and Mr V approached the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman analysed the complaints in light of the provisions of Article 44 and Article 52 of the Con- stitution on private property and the right of the per- son aggrieved by a public authority. Acting in accordance with Article 59, paragraph (2) of the Constitution and Article 4 and Article 22 of Law No. 35/1997 on the organisation and functioning of the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman contacted the local committees dealing with private land property, and asked them to take legal measures to clarify the reported problems and inform him of the outcome. Moreover, in the case of Mr V, the Ombudsman con- ducted an inquiry at the Local Land Fund Commission of M \u0103 rg \u0103 u, Cluj County. Following discussions with the Chair of the Local Land Fund Commission, it was agreed that the petitioner be invited to the M \u0103 rg \u0103 u Village Hall to identify the land. The complainant was advised to choose a company specialising in topographic measurement to assist him, considering that the public authority concerned did not have such a specialist at its disposal. Following the Ombudsman's involvement in Mr C's case, the Local Land Fund Commission of Valea Vinu- lui, Satu Mare County, invited the complainant to the Valea Vinului Village Hall in order to measure and restore the land, as claimed and validated by the County Land Fund Commission of Satu Mare. These two cases are not the only ones in which the Ombudsman's intervention prompted the competent public authorities to respect and implement legal pro- visions on the restoration of property. There have also been cases where the European Court of Human Rights has condemned Romania for violat- ing property rights (e.g., in the Sabin Popescu v. Roma- nia case of 2004, published in the Romanian Official Gazette No. 770/2005). Restitution of property has been and remains a com- plex process. The constitutional and legal role of the Ombudsman has proved to be efficient in the cases he has resolved through mediation and dialogue. Contact: Cornelia Cor and Luiza Portase, Property Experts, Ombudsman's Office; avp@avp.ro SLOVENIA Ombudsman lays Roma representation before the Constitutional Court In January 2010, the Slovenian Human Rights Ombudsman (Ombudsman) wrote to the Constitu- tional Court of Slovenia, requesting it to assess the compliance of Article 10 of the Roma Community Act with the Constitution and with the commit- ments of the state under international agreements ",
        "58 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies as regards the protection of human rights and freedoms. On the basis of the Constitutional Court Act, the Ombudsman requested a constitutional review of the said provision. He estimates that the contested provision unjustly denies part of the Roma com- munity, local Roma communities and civil law organisations of the Roma community the possi- bility to participate in the Council of the Roma Community in Slovenia. In the opinion of the Ombudsman, the provision does not comply with the constitutional principle of equality before the law, commitments of the state to prevent racial discrimination on the basis of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. The provision considers individual members of the Roma com- munity and individual local Roma communities in the allocation and enjoyment of special rights less favourably. The contested provision also infringes upon the right to freedom of association. By regu- lating the representation of the Roma community in relation to the state, the provision unjustly gives an advantage to one of the unions of the Roma societies. Article 65 of the Constitution stipulates that the position and special rights of the Roma commu- nity living in Slovenia are regulated by the law. The Ombudsman has consistently warned in past annual reports that the purpose of this constitu- tional provision has remained unrealised for a long time. The Local Government Act has at least partially regulated the position of the Roma com- munity at local government level. It stipulates the right to political participation in the local councils of some of the municipalities that members of the Roma community live in. In this way, the regula- tor has at least recognised some of the local Roma communities as special entities with special rights. Nonetheless, the position of the Roma community at state level has not been regulated. In response to the Ombudsman's annual report for 2002, 2003 and 2004, the national assembly adopted recom- mendations calling upon the government to ensure comprehensive legislative regulation of the position and special rights of the Roma commu- nity at state level. In 2007, the Roma Community Act was finally adopted. This act regulates, in detail, the position of the Roma community and defines the areas of special rights, jurisdictions of the state authorities and authorities of self-governing local communi- ties to implement these rights and for representa- tives of the Roma community to participate in the implementation of their rights and obligations. Besides the rights and obligations of all citizens, the Act stipulates special rights, by which mem- bers of the Roma community would more effi- ciently integrate into Slovenian society and assume responsibility for their own development. Special rights are not intended only for individual persons of Roma origin, but are, according to their nature, a collective right that can be implemented only in a collective manner. Their purpose is not only to protect individuals, but also to protect minority communities to which these individuals belong. The Roma Community Act stipulates a special right to organisation of the Roma community at state level and the financing of this organisation. Article 9 of the Act defines the Council of the Roma Community as the body that represents the interests of the Roma community in Slovenia in relation to state authorities. The Council is a legal person under public law. The tasks of the Council primarily include: consideration of issues referring to interests, position and rights of the Roma com- munity, making proposals and presenting initia- tives to competent authorities, promotion of activ- ities to preserve the Roma language and culture, promotion and organisation of cultural, informa- tion, publishing and other activities that are important for the development of the Roma com- munity, and preservation of contacts with Roma organisations in other countries. Furthermore, the Council may make proposals and give initiatives and opinions on matters under its jurisdiction to the national assembly, National Council, government, other state authorities, bear- ers of public authority and authorities of self- governing local communities. In this way, the state has tried to provide a representative body capable of representing various interests of the members of the Roma community in order to avoid an excessive number of negotiating or contractual partners when solving common issues. The first paragraph of Article 10 of the Roma Com - munity Act stipulates that the Council is com- posed of twenty-one members, of which fourteen are representatives of the Roma Union of Slovenia ",
        "59 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 and seven are members of councils of self-governing local communities, in which representatives of the Roma community are voted into the municipal or local council in accordance with the Act regulating Self-Governing Local Communities. The Ombudsman has determined that the Council is not a representative body of all members of the Roma community living in Slovenia. Namely, some Roma societies from the regions of Dolenjska and Bela Krajina (south-eastern part of Slovenia) have moved out of the Roma Union of Slovenia. On the basis of initiatives and discussions with the representatives of the Government Office of the Republic of Slovenia for Nationalities, the Ombudsman has established that the disagree- ments between Roma societies and their repre- sentatives from various areas of Slovenia are increasing, especially between \u2018indigenous\u2019 people (those who have a representative in a local council on the basis of the Act) and others especially from larger urban centres (primarily, Ljubljana and Maribor). Roma societies and unions that are not members of the Roma Union (societies from the regions of Dolenjska and Bela Krajina that moved out of the Roma Union and have formed their own Roma union) do not have a representative in the Roma Union. Already at the time of the adoption of the Roma Community Act, the said Roma societies had warned about inappropriate resolution of the re presentation of members of the Roma community. However, their proposals were not considered. Furthermore, in the Council there are no repre- sentatives (municipal councillors or repre sen- tatives of societies) of Roma communities from some municipalities in which the Roma commu- nity traditionally lives. The Ombudsman does not see any reasons why all Roma communities from individual munici- palities \u2013 where their interest in representation is already provided for and where they are consti- tuted as political subjects \u2013 are not systematically represented in the Council. In addition, the regu- lator did not consider that in Slovenia there are several interest associations of Roma communities, and that the problem of representation of the inter- ests of the Roma community concerns a heteroge- neous group. Furthermore, integration of civil freedom and political interest is a highly dynamic and not static process. The Ombudsman believes that the regulator has unduly privileged one of the unions of the Roma societies; namely, the largest one \u2013 the Roma Union \u2013 and in this way discriminated against the societies and unions operating outside this organi- sation. Representation of the Sinti in the Council of the Roma Community is also a particular problem in that the Sinti are not and do not want to be mem- bers of the Roma Union. On the other hand, the Roma Union does not want to leave one of its fourteen representatives in the Council of the Roma Community as a representative of the Sinti. The Ombudsman thinks that the Act would also have to consider the representation of the Sinti in the Council. Therefore, the Ombudsman proposed that the Constitutional Court assess the first paragraph of Article 10 of the Roma Community Act to deter- mine whether it complies with the Constitution and with the commitments of the state under international agreements. Furthermore, the Ombudsman also proposed that the Constitutional Court request that the national assembly eliminate the determined unconstitutionalities within a rea- sonable period of time.

The conference was attended by representatives of many ombudsman offices, among them the Danish Ombudsman, Mr Hans Gammeltoft-Hansen, who spoke about \u201cThe best practices of international coun- terpart offices\u201d, Parliamentary Swedish Ombudsman, Ms Kerstin Andre, who spoke about the \u201cExperiences of the Swedish Ombudsman with the Prosecutor's Office and the Judiciary\u201d, the Bulgarian Ombudsman, Mr Ginyo Ganev, who spoke about the \u201cSpecific work of the ombudsman in the Balkan countries\u201d, the Ombudsman of Catalonia, Spain, Mr Rafael Rib\u00f3, who spoke about the \u201cAccess of citizens to the offices of public administration and to the Office of Catalonian Ombudsman\u201d, and the Greek Deputy Ombudsman, Mr George Moschos, who spoke about the \u201cExperi- ence of the Greek Ombudsman in relation to the pro- tection of the rights of the child\u201d. The conference was also attended by the Macedonian Ombudsman, Mr Ixhet Memeti, the Kosovo Ombuds- man, Mr Sami Kurteshi, the Deputy Ombudsman of the Netherlands, Ms Adriana Stehouwer, and other representatives of counterpart offices.

It was the 20 th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and was celebrated worldwide. The national and international community highly appreciated the declaration of the year 2009 as the year of the child in Azerbaijan. Upon approval of the plan of action for the year of the child, several relevant state bodies were assigned different func- tions and various events were organised in this regard. By becoming party to this Convention, Azerbaijan undertook various obligations and took significant steps to cater for the rights of the child, such as improving national legislation, setting up new insti- tutions and creating relevant executive bodies for protecting the rights of the child. Establishment of the Ombudsman institution in the country provided an important stimulus in respect of the effective protection of the rights of the child, as this and the restoration of violated rights are among the main areas of activity of the Commis- sioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman). An officer specialising in the rights of the child works at the Office of the Ombudsman. The heads of the regional centres of the Ombudsman are also appointed as advisers on the rights of the child. Following the recommendation of the UN Commit- tee on the Rights of the Child, rights of the child centres were set up in the Office of the Ombudsman in 2006 with the financial support of Unicef. These centres are charged with: \u2022 protecting the rights of the child; \u2022 analysing complaints on the rights of the child addressed to the Ombudsman; \u2022 monitoring the implementation of the pro- visions of the Convention within national legislation; ",
        "61 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 \u2022 preparing the teaching modules and pro - grammes on the rights of the child by taking into account age and sex factors; \u2022 supporting exemplary work on the rights of the child; \u2022 monitoring information on the violation of the rights of the child reflected in mass media; \u2022 investigating allegations of child abuse in state institutions (orphanages, boarding schools, police units and institutions where children in conflict with the law are detained); \u2022 learning from international practice. The Ombudsman pays great attention to the sup- port of and education on the rights of the child in light of the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and national law, and organises many events in this regard. In this con- nection, the Ombudsman has organised training and other events in camps for refugees and inter- nally displaced persons (IDPs), schools and other related institutions for parents and other people responsible for the rights of the child. In order to ensure that the rights of the child are effectively protected, the Ombudsman: \u2022 monitors children's situation; \u2022 makes recommendations to improve national legislation on the rights of the child; \u2022 collaborates with state bodies, NGOs and international organisations; \u2022 organises public awareness campaigns and events. The Ombudsman pays great attention to mobilising children themselves in the campaigns designed to highlight the issues related to the rights of the child. In this regard, on the initiative of the Ombudsman and children themselves, the campaign: \u201cWe are the ambassadors of peace! Join us!\u201d was organised and the signatures of 310 000 children from the different regions of the country were collected and sent to the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms Radhika Coomarswamy. The Ombudsman organised the international con- ference on \u201cChildren in emergencies\u201d that was held in Baku and Guba city. Ombudspersons and experts from different countries participated and discussed the main issues of the protection of the rights of the child in war, natural and man-made disasters, etc. In the framework of the joint project between the Ombudsman and Unicef, the draft law on the \u201cPro- tection of children from corporal punishment\u201d was prepared and sent to parliament for approval. The Ombudsman's Office also printed the two posters: \u201cSave the children from corporal punishment\u201d and \u201cMe and my rights\u201d. The Ombudsman also supported the creation of Child Rights Clinics, which organise free of charge legal assistance for children and their families. The national plan of action for the protection of human rights, in line with the recommendations of the Ombudsman, was approved on 28 December 2006 by the order of the President. The plan covers activities concerning different strata of the popula- tion and strengthens the protection of the rights of the child. The Ombudsman considers that the edu- cation system should be conducted in such a way as to form a democratic vision and independent think- ing system. The adoption of new law on education will greatly contribute to the effective education of children and provide suitable conditions for solving problems. The parliament organised an international confer- ence on the 20 th anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, which it devoted to juvenal justice. The Ombudsman made a presentation on the \u201cDeprivation of liberty as a last resort and for the shortest period of time\u201d. Several children also participated in this conference. The parliament also established a working group to prepare the law on juvenal justice. An officer of the Ombudsman is a member of this group. The Ombudsman participated at the first Forum of the Children of Azerbaijan. Child delegates from all the cities and rural districts in the country took part in the Forum, participated in eight interactive group discussions on the priorities of the rights of the child and drafted statements for parliament, state bodies and civil society with their recommendations.

        "62 April 2010 The work of ombudsmen & similar bodies The Ombudsman asked the Minister of Education to send newly graduated teachers to rural areas and refugee and IDP camps. This request was highly appreciated and taken into consideration by the Ministry. The Ombudsman also agreed with the Minister on the hierarchical implementation of the rights of the child education system in primary and secondary schools. According to this system, pupils in higher classes train those in lower classes on their human rights. The Ombudsman prepared and printed manuals and textbooks for the hierarchical system and arranged for meetings in this regard at three pilot schools. Child trainers were trained in these schools. The Ombudsman also urged the Min- istry of Communication and Information Technolo- gies to assist in the creation of the rights of the child hotline number (916), which now functions regu- larly and effectively. One of the most important activities in the frame- work of the year of the child and 20 th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was the preparation of the special report of the Ombuds- man on the promotion and protection of the rights of the child in the country. This report was sent to the President, parliament and other related bodies, including the main ministries and state committees. It is also planned to translate the report with the support of the Unicef office in Baku and to send it to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as complimentary information to the government's report on the status of children in Azerbaijan. Over the last year, the Ombudsman continued to work with the different categories of children such as refugees, IDPs, disabled children, children deprived of parental care and living in institutions, children deprived of liberty, etc. The Ombudsman periodically visited juvenile correctional centres, orphanages, IDP camps, met with children and learned of their needs and problems. As a result of these visits the Ombudsman urged the relevant state bodies to improve the situation and restore the violated rights of children, including those from high risk groups and with disabilities. In addition, the Ombudsman delivered a speech on the protec- tion of the rights of the child in Azerbaijan and on the role of the Commissioner (Ombudsman) for Human Rights in the special plenary session of the parliament devoted to the 20 th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, organ- ised following her recommendations. So, during the year of the child 2009, the Ombuds- man used all that was in her capacity to ensure that public awareness campaigns were more effective, and that the 20 th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Azerbaijan was widely celebrated. This was conducted in close co- operation with state bodies, civil society, international organi- sations and with the active participation of children themselves. As a result, attention was focused on the current issues related to the rights of the child and on mobilising all the counterparts in the name of better promotion and protection of the rights of the child.

        "63 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 NORTHERN IRELAND Ombudsman celebrates 40 years of achievement The Office of Northern Ireland Ombudsman marked the start of its fortieth year of upholding citizens' rights against bureaucracy with an all-day confer- ence in November 2009. The current Ombudsman, Mr Tom Frawley, CBE, received a number of letters congratulating the Office on its achievements on behalf of citizens. The Ombudsman was particularly pleased to receive a letter from the European Ombudsman, Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros, acknow- ledging the work of the Office. The event was held not only to celebrate the work of the Office since it was established in 1969 but also examined how the role and constitutional position of the office of an ombudsman could be strengthened. Speakers included the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, past and present Northern Ireland Ombuds- men and representatives of Northern Ireland public bodies and advocacy groups, who all came together to acknowledge the work of the Office. Ann Abra - ham, UK Parliamentary and Health Service Ombuds- man, and Emily O'Reilly, Ombudsman for Ireland, also provided insights into the role of an ombuds- man in a changing world. The conference was attended by senior officials from over 170 bodies within the ombudsman's jurisdic- tion. Delegates heard the speakers state that the sys- tems, including the office of ombudsman, currently in place for Northern Ireland, to which citizens turn to get help when things go wrong had developed over time and meet different needs. They also heard that the reasons for setting up the Office in 1969 are still relevant; to have an independent and impartial office-holder to adjudicate on a dispute between a citizen and the state; to get redress for what they per- ceive to be poor treatment, mistakes, faults or injus- tices in their dealings with government agencies. The role of ombudsman as in other parts of the world has evolved effectively over time to meet public sector changes in what is becoming a more complex and difficult environment. The conference acknowledged that the downturn in the economy, retraction in public sector services and growing consumer expectations all presented new challenges for the public sector and the ombudsmen who holds government to account. The Ombudsman is conscious of his role in helping to improve the delivery of public services by shar- ing his insights gained through investigation of complaints. The Ombudsman therefore used the event to launch a new document entitled: Rights, Responsibilities and Redress , which provides useful guidance to public bodies and complainants on handling complaints. A copy can be downloaded from the Ombudsman's website http://www.ni- ombudsman.org.uk The 40 th anniversary of the Northern Ireland Ombudsman has provided an important opportu- nity to acknowledge the contribution of the office over four decades and to encourage debate about how the office of ombudsman can remain effective and relevant to the citizen.

The meeting was a part of the EU's Eastern Partnership (EaP) Countries' Ombudsman Co-operation Programme \u2013 a joint initia- tive of the Polish Ombudsman and the French Ombuds- man.

        "64 April 2010 Seminars & Meetings Partnership, namely: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The primary objective of co-operation, as stated by the originators of the Pro- gramme, is to strengthen the ability of ombudsman offices to participate in building a democratic state of law, where human rights would be observed. The Council meeting focused on defining the principles of co-operation under the Programme in the field of human rights protection and fundamental freedoms, and on adopting the Declaration on Co-operation. The Declaration outlines the main co-operation objectives and it establishes the institutions which would imple- ment the tasks listed therein. The participants in the meeting agreed that the priority issues requiring co- operation and exchange of experience included: coun- teracting discrimination, fighting violence, taking action for the benefit of crime victims (particularly chil - dren), and dealing with poverty. A number of other areas requiring co-operation were also identified, among others: bioethics-related issues, rights of chil- dren and of the elderly, solving religion-based conflicts, drug addiction, AIDS, economically motivated migra- tion of people, corruption, abuse of power by the uni- formed services, and even ecology in the context of human rights. The themes proposed for discussion con- firm the fact that the Partnership countries face similar, if not identical, challenges. A different main subject was suggested for each year. For example, the year 2010 is to be the \u201cYear of Soli- darity\u201d. It was also suggested that exchanging employ- ees \u2013 in the form of training trips and visits \u2013 would be a good way to foster co-operation between the ombudsman institutions. The Programme originators believe that to promote information exchange between the Partners, it would be necessary to establish a net- work of liaison officers responsible for implementing the Programme in individual offices. The originators also proposed common monitoring of the situation of prisoners in countries covered by the Programme. This could be achieved by joint visits to penitentiary institu- tions. The aim of undertaking such activities would be to improve the implementation of national mecha- nisms for preventing torture and inhuman treatment and punishment. The originators of the Programme also see the need to conduct joint research and scien- tific projects, and to undertake joint publishing activi - ties. The research to be undertaken could focus on the main issues dealt with by the ombudsman institutions in Partnership countries, resulting in recommenda- tions on preventive measures. The decisions on the implementation of individual co-operation projects are to be taken by the Human Rights Council, composed of ombudsmen from the EU's Eastern Partnership countries.

At the end of last year, this institu- tion therefore celebrated its 15 th anniversary. To mark this anniversary, an international conference on the theme: \u201cMEDIAtisaTION: communication at the heart of mediation\u201d was held in Namur on 23 and 24 November 2009. Some 140 participants from around the world shared their experiences in five workshops over the two days. \u201cMediation, not sexy enough for the media?\u201d was one of the subjects discussed by around 30 public media- tion and media experts who gave their opinions dur- ing the \u201cMEDIAtisaTION\u201d international conference. Positive discussions were held on the complex issue of what public mediation is: a specialist subject, but also a subject for everyone. How is it viewed and dealt with by the media? What is the best way of communicating with the media? To try and answer these questions, the attending ombudsmen drew on their experiences. The common point made by the various ombudsmen is that they must work in the public interest by dealing with indi- vidual complaints or petitions by individuals about an authority or public body. In addition to finding solutions to the problems faced by citizens in their relations with organisations, ombudsmen act as mirrors of the administration's actions and legislative work, on which they are also ",
        "65 European Ombudsmen Newsletter Issue No. 14 permitted to make recommendations. This advisory role is an essential democratic lever, in both EU coun- tries and also in southern countries: the various Afri- can ombudsmen present in Namur spoke about dif- ficult situations over which mediation has little influence, such as strikes in hospitals without a basic service. What role can mediation play in such cases? Many countries have now established a public media- tion institution. It must absolutely be functionally independent of the political power so that it can act. It must also be perceived as such by the public. Rais- ing awareness of the service that can be provided to citizens and ensuring that this is understood are cru- cial for all ombudsmen. In the Walloon region, over 3 000 complaints find their way to the ombudsman service. Clearly these are individual cases, but they represent the symptoms of a malfunction within the administration, even though only relayed by a few citizens. On 21 January 2010, the Ombudsman officially sub - mitted the 14 th annual report of the institution to the President of the Walloon parliament, in the presence of members of the Walloon parliament, the Walloon government and senior officials from the Walloon administration. This 14 th annual report brings the total number of complaints since the institution's cre- ation to more than 23 000, with over 80 recommenda- tions having been made by the Ombudsman for the Walloon region. For several years, it has been the areas of energy, taxation and social housing that have generated most complaints.

Both events were well attended. I should like to take this oppor- tunity to reiterate my thanks to all the participants. I thank the members of the EOI for their great vote of confidence, which has given me a mandate to lead the EOI for another two years. For my part, I once again made no promises at the general assem- bly, other than a pledge to work with all my energy for the EOI, and I shall honour that pledge. May I offer my warm congratulations to all mem- bers of the EOI who were elected to executive func- tions, and I explicitly include the two auditors. Speaking as President, but most of all on behalf of the Executive Board, I hope for constructive and fruitful co-operation that will enable the EOI to make further progress. Let me remind you that we are the largest ombudsman institution in Europe. Over the past two years, our membership has grown by 22%. Another particularly important development is that the EOI has now completely cleared its debts, thanks to the retiring treasurer, Josef Hauser. The Executive Board and the Board of Directors will hold meetings at the start of 2010 to map out the course for the next two years. If there are any pro- posals you wish to make in this respect, you are cor- dially invited to pass them on to me before the end of 2009. As for me, my main task will be to keep seeking close co-operation with European institu- tions and particularly with the European Ombuds- man. It also remains my objective to find opportuni - ties for constructive co-operation with the International Ombudsman Institute (IOI). The meeting on e-petitions, which followed the gen- eral assembly, was in my opinion, a success. Allow me to use members' information notes to re-emphasise the importance of the role of e-petitions in ombudsman systems. I thank everyone who contributed to the suc- cess of that working meeting. Spread the word on the e-petition idea. I believe it will bear fruit. Members of the EOI Executive Board The members of our Executive Board are: Ullrich Galle, President; Burgi Volgger, Vice-President; Guido Schuermans (Catherine de Bruecker), Vice- President; Dieter von Blarer, Secretary; Gabriele Strele, Treasurer; Vittorio Gasparrini; Nina Karpa- chova and Josef Siegele, Secretary-General.

I am particularly pleased that the general assembly adopted my proposal for the provision in our Stat- ute of the office of a secretary-general and the elec - tion of a member to that office. By electing Mr Josef Siegele to serve in this function, I believe the gen- eral assembly has ensured that the EOI will live up to its responsibilities. Nikolaus Schw\u00e4rzler given a ceremonial send-off Mr Nikolaus Schw\u00e4rzler, the remaining founding member of the Institute, stepped down from the Board of Directors at the general assembly. In 1987, Mr Schw\u00e4rzler, who held the office of Landesvolk- sanwalt (Provincial People's Advocate) in Vorarl- berg, became one of the founders of the EOI and had been on the Board ever since. He served as President of the EOI from 1996 to 2000. Even after stepping down from his post as Provincial People's Advocate and from the presidency of the EOI, he continued to play a major role in shaping the des- tiny of the Institute, for example as Treasurer and as a member of the Executive Board. As re-elected President of the EOI, I emphasised that Nikolaus Schw\u00e4rzler had made great contribu- tions to the establishment of ombudsman institu- tions in the new democracies of eastern and south- eastern Europe and to the unique collection of activity reports and specialised literature at the EOI office in Innsbruck. In seminars at the seat of the EOI and abroad, as a lecturer in ombudsmanship and in numerous publications, he has promoted the spread of ombudsman institutions, which are of such great importance to ordinary people. For this reason, he was awarded honorary life mem- bership of the EOI at the general assembly in Inns- bruck in April 2006. To mark his retirement from the Board, I and Vice-President Burgi Volgger, who was also re-elected, presented Mr Schw\u00e4rzler with a cer- tificate of achievement and the EOI symbol carved in obsidian. Josef Siegele is the new Secretary-General Mr Josef Siegele, who was elected by the Board as the new Secretary-General after the general assem- bly, will take over Mr Schw\u00e4rzler's duties. Mr Siegele is a member of staff in the office of the Provincial People's Advocate of Tyrol and has gath- ered extensive professional experience in various functions at home and abroad. The Institute also said farewell to Vice-President Felix D\u00fcnser, who also stepped down as People's Advo- cate of Vorarlberg province at the end of October. He had served on the Executive Committee in various capacities since 2000. Besides producing publications and delivering lectures on the ombudsman concept at home and abroad, he had also championed the inter- ests of ombudsmen, particularly through the Council of Europe. The new Vice-President is Guido Schuer- mans; he and Catherine de Bruecker are the joint Fed- eral Ombudsmen of Belgium. Another retiring Board member to be honoured was Mr Giorgio Morales, Ombudsman of the region of Tuscany, whose term of office will end in January. It was to his credit, and that of his chief member of staff, Mr Vittorio Gasparrini, that the general assem- bly in Florence was organised in such an exemplary manner. ",
