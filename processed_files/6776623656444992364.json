        "COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 214/2007 of 28 February 2007 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code ( 1 ), and in particular Article 247 thereof, Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 ( 2 ) lays down a management system for tariff quotas. To reduce the administrative burden and costs at importation and to promote uniformity of treatment, provision has been made that certain tariff quotas are to be considered as critical. Experience with the system and improved use of electronic exchange of data between the Member States and the Commission have shown that the criteria used in determining the critical status can be further relaxed without a risk to the Community's own resources. Accordingly a tariff quota should be considered as critical where 90 % of the initial quota volume, instead of 75 % as in the current system, has been used. (2) The need to carry out surveillance of goods in order to obtain data related to imports and exports has increased considerably. As a consequence, in cases of surveillance of goods, Member States should provide to the Commission, more frequently than under the current system, data on customs declarations for release for free circulation or on export declarations. Where such data are not available or are only partially available on the date of the customs declaration under a simplified procedure, they should be provided afterwards. (3) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly. (4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is amended as follows: 1. In Article 308a(10), the term \u2018 ECU 10 \u2019 is replaced by \u2018 10 euro \u2019 . 2. Article 308c is amended as follows: (a) in paragraph 1, the percentage \u2018 75 % \u2019 is replaced by \u2018 90 % \u2019 ; (b) in paragraph 3, the percentage \u2018 75 % \u2019 is replaced by \u2018 90 % \u2019 . 3. Article 308d is replaced by the following: \u2018 Article 308d 1. Where Community surveillance is to be carried out, the Member States shall provide to the Commission at least once every week data on customs declarations for release for free circulation or on export declarations. The Member States shall cooperate with the Commission to determine which data are required from customs declarations for release for free circulation or from export declarations. 2. The data provided under paragraph 1 by individual Member States shall be treated as confidential. However, aggregate data for each Member State shall be available for authorised users in all Member States. The Member States shall cooperate with the Commission to set up the practical rules on authorised access to the aggregate data. 3.

        "ANNEX For the purposes of this Regulation, the following units, modes of data collection, reference periods and definitions shall apply. 1. Units The target variables relate exclusively to the household. Where dealing with financial services, the household should be understood as any member of the household. 2. Modes of data collection For all target variables the mode of data collection is personal interview with the household respondent or extraction from registers. 3. Reference periods The target variables relate to four types of reference periods: \u2014 last 12 months ( Arrears ), \u2014 next 12 months ( Future expectations ), \u2014 last three months ( Uncleared balance credit/store card ), \u2014 current ( All other variables ). 4. Definitions (1) Amounts (a) Variables for collecting amounts: the amount is to be collected according to a harmonised discrete scale to be established by the Working Group on Living Conditions. (2) Bank account (a) Bank current account: deposit account offering day-to-day money management facilities such as various flexible payment methods to allow customers to distribute money directly to others. Standard services offered by current accounts include a cheque book, the facility to arrange standing orders, direct debits and payment via a debit card. A savings account is not a current account where no such facilities are available. (b) Bank account overdraft: the household is currently maintaining a negative balance on one of its bank accounts because of financial difficulties (urgent need of money, output higher than input, etc.). Interest is charged on the amount owed. The bank account does not need to be a current account. (3) Credit/store cards (a) Credit cards (Visa, Amex, MasterCard, Diners, etc.) provide a specific credit facility: money is lent to people between the time they purchase goods and the time of full repayment of the amount; interest is to be paid on any balance that is not cleared at the end of the month. There are monthly statements for the money spent specifying the minimum amount to be paid. Credit cards are not bank debit cards, where the money spent on the card is immediately deducted from a linked bank account. (b) Store cards are credit cards issued by a single company/store and can only be used for payments to that company/store. (c) Uncleared balance: the household has not paid in full at the \u2018 end of the month \u2019 the amount spent or owed with credit/store cards for at least the last three months because of financial difficulties. (4) Source of credit and loans (a) Credit and loans encompasses any commercial credit or loans with planned and scheduled repayments, except mortgage loans for the main dwelling. Overdraft facilities, credit or store cards for which repayments are not planned are not included. Borrowing from friends and relatives (informal credit) is not included either. (5) Arrears (a) Arrears: amount owed (bills, rent, credit/mortgage repayment, etc.) not paid on schedule during the last 12 months for financial reasons; same concept as used for HS010, HS020 and HS030. EN 1.3.2007 Official Journal of the European Union L 62/9 ",
        "(b) Total amount currently in arrears: the sum of the amounts the household currently owes that could not be paid on schedule. (c) Housing-related bills/payments: rent and mortgage repayment for the main dwelling and utility bills (water, electricity, gas, heating, etc.). Should correspond to the coverage of variables HS010 and HS020. (d) Other loans and credit repayment: cash loans (other than mortgage repayment for the main dwelling) or hire purchase instalments and the like (e.g. mail order catalogues, car finance, etc.). Minimum credit/store card repayments are also included. Should correspond to the coverage of variable HS030. (e) Other non-housing household bills: education, health, any other bills not covered by housing-related bills. (6) Drop in income (a) Income: gross total income of the household. (7) Financial exclusion (a) Reasons why the household does not have a current bank account and needs one: several reasons can be mentioned and will be reported though indicators variables MI111-MI114. Questions are filtered: households that do have a bank current account or do not need one should not be asked the questions. (b) Reasons why the household does not have commercial credit and needs it: several reasons can be mentioned and will be reported though indicators variables MI122-MI125. Commercial credit: overdraft facilities, credit or store cards, mortgages and other loans or credit linked to purchases. Borrowing from friends and relatives is not included. Questions are filtered: households that do have commercial credit or do not need it should not be asked the questions. Households having borrowed only from family and friends should be asked the questions. 5. Transmission of data to Eurostat The target secondary variables on \u2018 over-indebtedness and financial exclusion \u2019 will be sent to Eurostat in the household data file (H) after the target primary variables.

REQUEST (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain graphite electrode systems originating in India. (2) The request was lodged on 15 January 2007 by the European Carbon and Graphite Association (ECGA) on behalf of Community producers of certain graphite electrode systems. B. PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is graphite electrodes of a kind used for electric furnaces, with an apparent density of 1,65 g/cm 3 or more and an electrical resistance of 6,0 \u03bc\u03a9 .m or less, falling within CN code ex 8545 11 00 (Taric code 8545 11 00 10) and nipples used for such electrodes, falling within CN code ex 8545 90 90 (Taric code 8545 90 90 10) whether imported together or separately originating in India (the product concerned). These codes are given for infor- mation only. (4) The product under investigation is artificial graphite rods of a diameter of 75 mm or more originating in India (the product under investigation), normally declared under CN code ex 3801 10 00 (TARIC code 3801 10 00 10). This code is given for information only. The product under investigation is an intermediate product in the manufacturing of the product concerned, and it already embodies the basic characteristics of the latter product. C. EXISTING MEASURES (5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1629/2004 ( 2 ). D. GROUNDS (6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned are being circumvented by means of imports of the product under investigation. (7) The evidence submitted is as follows: (i) The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from India to the Community has taken place following the imposition of anti-dumping measures on the product concerned, and that there is insufficient due cause or justifi- cation other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. (ii) This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a simple conversion operation carried out in the Community whereby imports of the product under investigation are converted into the product concerned. (iii) Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined in terms of quantity. Significant volumes of imports of the product under investigation appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. (iv) Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the product under inves- tigation after conversion are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned. (v) Should circumvention practices covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than simple conversion, be identified in the course of the inves- tigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.

( 2 ) OJ L 295, 18.9.2004, p. 10. ",
        "E. PROCEDURE (8) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regu- lation and to make imports of the product under inves- tigation subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. (a) Questionnaires (9) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send question- naires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in India, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures and to the authorities of India. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry. (10) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties. (11) The authorities of India will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request. (b) Collection of information and holding of hearings (12) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. (c) Exemption of imports from registration or measures (13) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if such impor- tation does not constitute circumvention. (14) Since the possible circumvention takes place inside the Community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to importers of the product under investigation that can show that they are not related to producers subject to the measures. Importers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation. F. REGISTRATION (15) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports originating in India. G. TIME LIMITS (16) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which: \u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation, \u2014 importers in the Community may request exemption from registration of imports or measures, \u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. (17) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation. H. NON-COOPERATION (18) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. (19) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regu- lation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated, EN 1.3.2007 Official Journal of the European Union L 62/17 ",

        "II (Acts adopted under the EC Treaty/Euratom Treaty whose publication is not obligatory) DECISIONS COMMISSION COMMISSION DECISION of 26 February 2007 establishing that Article 30(1) of Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors applies to the supply of electricity and gas in England, Scotland and Wales (notified under document number C(2007) 559) (Only the English text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2007/141/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors ( 1 ), and in particular Article 30(4) and (6) thereof, Having regard to the request submitted by the United Kingdom by e-mail of 24 October 2006 and confirmed by a signed fax of the same date, and to the additional information requested by Commission staff by e-mail of 17 November 2006 and submitted by the United Kingdom by e-mail of 27 November 2006, Having regard to the conclusions of the independent national authority, the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), that the conditions for the applicability of Article 30(1) of Directive 2004/17/EC would be met, Whereas: (1) Article 30 of Directive 2004/17/EC provides that contracts intended to enable the performance of one of the activities to which the Directive applies shall not be subject to the Directive if, in the Member State in which it is carried out, the activity is directly exposed to compe- tition on markets to which access is not restricted. Direct exposure to competition is assessed on the basis of objective criteria, taking account of the specific charac- teristics of the sector concerned. Access is deemed to be unrestricted if the Member State has implemented and applied the relevant Community legislation opening a given sector or a part of it. (2) This legislation is listed in Annex XI of Directive 2004/17/EC, which, for the electricity sector, refers to Directive 96/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 2 ). Directive 96/92/EC has been superseded by Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC ( 3 ), which requires an even higher EN 1.3.2007 Official Journal of the European Union L 62/23 ( 1 ) OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 1.

        "degree of market opening. In respect of the gas sector, Annex XI refers to Directive 98/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas ( 4 ). Directive 98/30/EC has been superseded by Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 98/30/EC ( 5 ), which requires an even higher degree of market opening. (3) Under Article 62(2)(2) of Directive 2004/17/EC, Title III of that Directive setting out the rules on service design contests does not apply to contests organised for the pursuit, in the Member State concerned, of an activity to which the applicability of Article 30(1) of the Directive has been established by a Commission decision or has been deemed applicable under the second or third subparagraph of Article 30(4) or the fourth subparagraph of Article 30(5). (4) The request submitted by the United Kingdom concerns the supply, both wholesale and retail, of electricity and gas in England, Scotland and Wales. Although there may be some similarities, the respective characteristics, in particular the very limited degree of substitutability, nevertheless render it appropriate to consider that there are two different product markets, one for gas and one for electricity, rather than one product market for \u2018 energy \u2019 . (5) Given the unified character of the markets for electricity of the three geographical areas concerned by the present request and the limited capacity ( 6 ) of the connections between the United Kingdom networks and those of other areas of the Community, England, Scotland and Wales should be considered to constitute the relevant market for electricity for the purposes of evaluating the conditions laid down in Article 30(1) of Directive 2004/17/EC. In respect of gas, it should also be concluded that the relevant geographic market is Great Britain, since, as noted by the British Office of Fair Trade, \u2018 this is the limit of the gas trading regime: although gas is traded with continental Europe through the Bacton- Zeebrugge interconnector, quantities traded are relatively small. \u2019 The same applies to quantities traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland (not covered by this Decision) and Ireland. These conclusions are consistent with one of the findings of the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Report on progress in creating the internal gas and elec- tricity market ( 7 ), hereinafter referred to as the \u2018 2005 Report \u2019 , that \u2018 in economic terms \u2026 electricity and gas markets in the EU remain national in economic scope \u2019 . (6) This assessment, and any other contained in this Decision, is made solely for the purposes of Directive 2004/17/EC and is without prejudice to the application of the rules on competition. (7) In respect of electricity, the United Kingdom has imple- mented and applied not only Directive 96/92/EC but also Directive 2003/54. Concerning gas, the United Kingdom has also implemented not only Directive 98/30/EC, but also Directive 2003/55/EC. Consequently, and in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 30(3), access to the market should be deemed not to be restricted, both in respect of electricity and gas. (8) Direct exposure to competition should be evaluated on the basis of various indicators, none of which are, per se, decisive. In the 2005 Report, the Commission stated that \u2018 many national markets display a high degree of concen- tration of the industry, impeding the development of effective competition \u2019 ( 8 ). Consequently, it considered that \u2018 one indicator for the degree of competition on national markets is the total market share of the biggest three producers (electricity) and wholesale suppliers (gas) \u2019 ( 9 ). According to the latest available infor- mation, the aggregate market share of the three largest electricity generators of the total production is 39 % ( 10 ), while the aggregate market share of the three largest gas shippers in percentage of the wholesale market is 36 % ( 11 ). Both these levels must be considered to be at a satisfactorily low level and should be taken as an indi- cation of direct exposure to competition. (9) The degree of liquidity is also a good indicator of compe- tition, as the conditions of competition in electricity and gas supply are greatly influenced by liquidity in wholesale markets. The United Kingdom wholesale market for elec- tricity is characterised by being a bilateral trading market, with brokered deals. There is also more than one power exchange, although UKPX has the largest volume. Some of the principal actors on the wholesale market are the owners of generation capacity, with ownership of generation capacity being rather diverse with eight EN L 62/24 Official Journal of the European Union 1.3.2007 ( 4 ) OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 1.

        "companies sharing around 70 % of capacity. For the United Kingdom, liquidity multiple term trading amounts to around three times the amount consumed ( 12 ). This degree of liquidity should be considered as being satisfactory, i.e. it is such as to constitute an indicator of a well-functioning and compe- titive wholesale market. For the gas sector, liquidity multiple term trading should also be considered to be at a satisfactory level, as it also amounts to two to three times total consumption ( 13 ). At the retail levels as well, there are a sufficient number of actors, as there are six main suppliers active in the household market with addi- tional companies active in the large user sector. ( 14 ) The gas markets are also characterised by a sufficient number of active players and can be summarised as follows: \u2018 The (United Kingdom) gas market has a high level of compe- tition with around 10 companies active in the wholesale market. As with electricity, six companies account for the majority of the domestic supply market \u2026 (of which) \u2026 five are new entrants to the gas supply market. Larger users buy direct from the wholesale market, which also includes many major oil companies \u2019 ( 15 ). These factors should therefore be taken as an indication of direct exposure to competition. (10) The workings of the balancing markets should also be considered as indicators, not only in respect of production but also for the wholesale and retail markets. In fact, \u2018 any market participant who cannot easily match its generation portfolio to the characteristics of its customers may find itself exposed to the difference between the price at which the TSO (transmission system operator) will sell imbalance energy, and the price at which it will buy back excess production. These prices may either be directly imposed by the regulator on the TSO; or alternatively a market based mechanism will be used in which the price is determined by bids from other producers to regulate their production upwards or downwards \u2026 a key difficulty for small market parti- cipants arises where there is the risk of a large spread between the buying price from the TSO and the selling price. This occurs in a number of Member States and is likely to be detrimental to the development of compe- tition. A high spread may be indicative of an insufficient level of competition in the balancing market which may be dominated by only one or two main generators. Such difficulties are made worse where network users are unable to adjust their positions close to real time \u2019 ( 16 ). Since the introduction of the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA) there has been a unified balancing market for England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, its main characteristics (market based pricing, half-hourly gate closures and a fairly low spread) are such that it should be taken as an indicator of direct exposure to competition. Similarly for gas, balancing prices are derived on the basis of a market mechanism operated by the TSO. Imbalances are settled on a daily basis and there is not usually a significant spread between the buy and sell price. This non discri- minatory mechanism does not act as a barrier to suppliers. (11) Given the characteristics of the products concerned here (electricity and gas) and the scarcity or unavailability of suitable substitutable products or services, price compe- tition and price formation assume greater importance when assessing the competitive state of the electricity and gas markets. The number of customers switching supplier is an indicator of genuine price competition and, thus, indirectly, \u2018 a natural indicator of the effec- tiveness of competition. If few customers are switching, there is likely to be a problem with the functioning of the market, even if the benefits from the possibility of renegotiating with the historical supplier should not be ignored \u2019 ( 17 ). Furthermore, \u2018 the existence of regulated end- user prices is clearly a key determinant of customer behaviour \u2026 Although the retaining of controls may be justified in a period of transition, these will increasingly cause distortions as the need for investment approaches \u2019 ( 18 ). (12) In the UK, the degree of switching for the three cate- gories of users of electricity \u2014 large and very large industrial users, small and medium-sized industrial and business, and very small business and household users \u2014 is above 70 % for the first two groups and close to 50 % for the last category ( 19 ) and end-user price control was abolished in respect of electricity in 2002 ( 20 ). Concerning gas, the degree of switching for the three categories of users \u2014 large and very large industrial users including power plants, small and medium-sized industrial and business, and very small business and households \u2014 is above 70 % for the first two groups and close to 50 % for the last category ( 21 ). Price controls for all end users have been removed since 2002. The situation in the United Kingdom is therefore satisfactory as far as switching and end-user price control are concerned and should be taken as an indicator of direct exposure to competition.

        "(13) In view of these indicators and given the overall picture of this sector in England, Scotland and Wales \u2014 in particular the extent to which networks have been unbundled from generation/supply and the effective regu- lation of network access \u2014 that emerges from the infor- mation submitted by the United Kingdom, the 2005 Report and the Technical Annex thereto as well as from the Preliminary Report, the condition of direct exposure to competition laid down in Article 30(1) of Directive 2004/17/EC should be considered to be met in respect of electricity and gas supply in England, Scotland and Wales. As noted in recital 7, the further condition of free access to the activity must be deemed to be met. Consequently, Directive 2004/17/EC should not apply when contracting entities award contracts intended to enable the supply of electricity and/or gas generation to be carried out in these geographical areas nor when they organise design contests for the pursuit of such an activity there. It is recalled that contracts awarded for the pursuit of other activities, such as the distribution of electricity and gas, continue to be subject to the provisions of Directive 2004/17/EC. (14) This Decision is based on the legal and factual situation as of November 2006 as it appears from the information submitted by the United Kingdom, the 2005 Report and the Technical Annex thereto. It may be revised, should significant changes in the legal or factual situation mean that the conditions for the applicability of Article 30(1) of Directive 2004/17/EC are no longer met.
