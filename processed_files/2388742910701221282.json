        "COUNTRY REPORT Hj^u\u00a3\" Chad The country \u00a1n Africa that is most distant from the sea, Chad is going through a somewhat rocky d\u00e9mo\u00ad cratisation process. For too many years, it was ravaged by civil war and today, new rebellions threaten. Then there is the North\u00adSouth di\u00ad vide, whether real or imagined, which affects daily life. In this context, it is difficult to envisage a socio\u00adeconomic renaissance, although there are those who are hoping that oil, which is expected to come on stream sooner or later, will be the launchpad for future prosperity. pages 17 to 36 DOSSIER The sustainable development of tourism Sustainable tourism development is about safeguarding and maintaining the resources that tourism is built on \u00ad economic, ecological, cultural and so\u00ad cial. The aim is to ensure that these remain intact so as to benefit not just today's generation but also our chil\u00ad dren and their children, the stake\u00ad holders of tomorrow. In this issue, we examine the sector from a number of different angles, with a particular focus on bringing benefits to the people in the host countries, and on strategies to ensure that tourist infra\u00ad structures reflect modern environ\u00ad mental concerns. pages 41 to 71 \u00bf ^ *> ^ e >- ^:-\u039b\u0393\u00b7\u0393- .^w \u00c4 -I ~> -siti* *a* ETHIOPIA v Hed s ERITREA \\ Sea \\ Y E M EN 1 c^C\u2014 Daddato Djibouti Ma 3ho Obock, Yoboki Lake Abbe Tadjourah Lake Assai \u039b Gulf jourah Djibouti Gulf of Aden Corrigendum On page 26 of the last issue of The Courier, we published a map of Djibouti inadvertently omit\u00ad ting Eritrea as one of the neigh\u00ad bouring countries, having made use of an old map.

        "'The s t a k e h o l d e rs are our c h i l d r e n' Ambassador Michael King of Barbados speaks to The Courier about sustainable tourism development I Michael King, who is Barba\u00ad | dos' Ambassador to the EU, | Belgium, Germany and Italy, I is no newcomer to the con\u00ad | cept of sustainable tourism | development (featured in this issue's Dossier). Coming from a country where tourism is the number one source of foreign ex\u00ad change, this is perhaps no surprise. But Mr King is quite rare for a modern diplomat in that, during his career, he has worked on giving practical meaning to the concept in the context of the Caribbean is\u00ad lands. During the recent ITB Tourism Exchange in Berlin, he found time to share some of his views with The Courier. He began by explaining his background in tourism. \u00ad Throughout my career, I have been involved in issues relat\u00ad ing to tourism, the sustainable development of the environment and the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). From 1986 to 1989, I was seconded to the Caribbean Conservation Association as Executive Director. This organisation is concerned with preserving and managing the natural, coastal and built\u00adup environment, as well as the Car\u00ad ibbean's cultural heritage. At that time, 17 governments were mem\u00ad bers together with more than 70 other organisations \u00ad based both inside and outside the Caribbean \u00ad ranging from national trusts, en\u00ad vironmental bodies and historical societies to certain regional and international partners. There were also a number of individual mem\u00ad bers. From 1990 to 1995, I was Resident Representative at the office of the General Secretariat of the Organisation of American States (OAS). I was appointed Ambassador to the EU for Barba\u00ad dos in July 1995. \u25a0 The buzzwords 'sustainable de\u00ad velopment' are very much linked with 'tourism' this year in the international arena. Key stake\u00ad holders will be discussing the sub\u00ad ject at the forthcoming 7th session of the UN Commission for Sustain\u00ad able Development. Based on your experience, what do you think are the main issues in sustainable tourism development? \u00ad Sound environmental po\u00ad licies and sound planning policies. Whatever you do should be for the long\u00adterm benefit of the peo\u00ad ple rather than the short\u00adterm economic benefit of a few. In the Caribbean, many islands are becoming increasingly dependent on tourism. Their most valuable asset is their environ\u00ad ment: prime beach areas, and beautiful but extremely fragile eco\u00adsystems. The latter, if managed correctly, are a major potential source of economic benefit. But you need to have careful planning, with the right mechanisms and government policies. Otherwise, there is a very real danger that the islands' tourism potential will quickly be destroyed and the as\u00ad sets \u00ad environmental, economic, social and cultural \u00ad will be lost permanently. Site selection is extremely important. A 500\u00adroom hotel right on the shoreline may pose a threat to coastal marine life. If you destroy a mangrove that provides a fertile area for several species of fish, these species will disappear, thus killing off local fishing activ\u00ad ity. Assessment of whether the infrastructure and natural resource base in a particular place can sustain this kind of development also entails other considerations: potential coastal and soil erosion; measures related to water conser\u00ad vation; solid waste disposal; the type of sewage systems to be employed; disposal of chlorinated water and so on. Bleach alone can destroy the coral reefs and thus remove the protection that they provide against the forces of nat\u00ad ure in the coastal zone. The optimum size and type of property to be constructed in a given environment also matters. The creation of an urban sprawl is not ideal in an island environ\u00ad ment. Often, the standard used is 'never construct a building that is taller than the coconut palm trees'. \u25a0 You were involved in develop\u00ad ing policy guidelines for the sus\u00ad tainable development of tourism in the Out Islands of the Bahamas. Can you explain what these in\u00ad volved ? \u00ad The overall objective was to come up with a set of guide\u00ad lines that would lead to the devel\u00ad opment of an eco\u00adsensitive tourism industry in the Bahamas. There are more than 700 islands and keys in the Out Islands. The guidelines were commissioned by the Minis\u00ad try of Tourism with support from the OAS while I was Resident Representative. The first of their kind, they have gained interna\u00ad tional recognition and generated a lot of interest. In 1996, the \u00ce the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "m e e t i ng p o i nt World Tourism Organisation called on its 170 member states to in\u00ad stitute similar policy guidelines for the sustainable development of tourism. Great care was taken to ensure that local people were recognised as a major tourism development stakeholder (as both investor and beneficiary). A wide range of issues was addressed including the environment, cul\u00ad ture, the economy and the social fabric. Measures identified con\u00ad cerned green investment, site se\u00ad lection, optimum site development and planning strategies, and in all these, the needs of local people were a major factor. The guide\u00ad lines were inspired, not just by the consultant, but also by local peo\u00ad ple living on the Out Islands. Their concerns were listened to carefully. On account of their long\u00adterm knowledge of local climatic and environmental conditions, they were often better placed than any expert consultant, relying purely on environmental impact assessments, to identify potential development dangers. \u25a0 Tourism is an economic activity that generates wealth, and a lot of people have an obvious interest in its development. Who, in your opinion, are the stakeholders? \u00ad The resources on which tourism is based are not ours. We are simply the custodians for fu\u00ad ture generations. So the stake\u00ad holders are our children, their children and so forth. We have a responsibility to ensure that what we do is not for short\u00adterm eco\u00ad nomic gain, but rather for the long\u00adterm benefit of future gen\u00ad erations. If you look at the 'built' environment, tourism can do an enormous amount to promote the protection of our cultural heri\u00ad tage. People must be given the right incentives to participate in restoring historic buildings, sites and monuments. Promotion of vernacular architecture, if done properly, can go a long way in encouraging both tourists and the local community to appreciate their environment for its aesthetic and cultural value \u00ad and to main\u00ad tain it. \u25a0 But aren't tourism ventures likely to be undertaken mainly for immediate or short\u00adterm re\u00ad turns. \u00ad There have been classic cases of what I would call the 'one night stand approach' to tourism development (if you will pardon the expression). An investor falls in love with a particular Caribbean island and decides to build a 100\u00ad room hotel. With some very loose planning permission, the building goes up. Little attention is paid to coastal zone management require\u00ad ments. Groynes to prevent erosion are not used in creating the fancy beach. Everything is ready. The property is marketed worldwide. Tempting brochures are prepared and the tour operators and travel agents are invited for a pre\u00adseason viewing. Wowed by what they see, they return home, and start re\u00ad commending that tourists go and enjoy this piece of paradise. How\u00ad ever, during the winter, nature runs its course and changes take place. The following season, tour\u00ad ists arrive in search of paradise and return home complaining because the beach that looked so beautiful in the brochure now looks, like some kind of war zone. All you can see along the shoreline is a collection of boulders and rubble. The hotel's occupancy levels drop (purely as a result of the beach erosion) because travel agents do not want to risk further com\u00ad plaints. So what happens to the investment and the beach? What happens to the jobs that were supposed to be created for the people in the community? The tourism business is about profiting from investments, but if you don't do it properly, you will lose your shirt. Interestingly, more companies and hotels around the world are now clearly appreciating this fact. They are applying sound green manage\u00ad ment principles relating to water conservation and the use of en\u00ad ergy. They are adopting better environmental practices designed to protect inshore marine life and to manage the reefs properly. The challenge is to educate the travel trade, governments and their agencies to understand the long\u00adterm importance of sustain\u00ad able tourism development. These groups need to be sensitised as to what sustainable development re\u00ad quires, and to the dangers of failing to adopt the right policies. There are no 'quick fixes' here. \u25a0 Is it really possible to market sustainable tourism ? Do you think tourists genuinely care about con\u00ad servation issues when they go on holiday? \u00ad Yes, I think the average tourist is much more aware than some people would give him or her credit for. Every decision we make in life is based on what quality of environment we want. Environmental health is very im\u00ad portant to tourism. When people talk about the ambience of a place, what they really mean is the environment. The 'difference between a good\u00ad holiday and a bad one depends to a great extent on the environment \u00ad which in\u00ad cludes the location, the people, the facilities and so on. \u25a0 What do you think of schemes to raise revenue from tourists for use in maintaining the environ\u00ad ment of the holiday locations they visit? \u00ad There are various fees and charges that can be imposed at different levels. It depends very much on the amount proposed as a tax, how it is collected and how it is used. Tourism levies collected by governments generally contribute to the general budget and are not hypothecated for specific expendi\u00ad ture like safeguarding the envir\u00ad onment. Very often, spending on infrastructure has to be recouped. In the Caribbean, cruiseship opera\u00ad tors once threatened to pull out of the region because of higher charges intended to reflect more fully the costs of their presence. In this instance, the Caribbean was in a strong position, because the region represents the main source of revenue for the cruiseship com\u00ad panies. There is no reason why small islands should have to bear the full cost of the required infra\u00ad structure. An island might receive 500 cruise ships in a year. But the passengers, if they come ashore, may not spend the volumes of money you might expect. The island still has to cope with the resulting drain on its often scarce resources. the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 \u0392 ",
        "m e e t i ng p o i nt At the level of the host destination, there is a lot of scope for charging visitors a specific environmental or conservation levy. This does not have to be exorbitant, and could be based on the length of a visitor's stay. The income could then contribute to the environmental conservation work carried out by local bodies, NGOs, the various national trusts, and historical and cultural socie\u00ad ties. Of course, transparency is essential. I strongly believe that if you explain to visitors how the levy will contribute to the man\u00ad agement and maintenance of the natural and built environment, most of them will accept it. \u25a0 What do you think about the role of education in achieving sustainable tourism development? \u00ad This is critical. Environ\u00ad mental education at all levels is crucial. Key decision\u00admakers must be convinced about the impor\u00ad tance of advocating responsible tourism development. People have to understand and feel that they are stakeholders. We are also speaking about the economics of the envir\u00ad onment; putting a value on your resources. This can only be achieved through education. At the community level, people have to understand the economic im\u00ad You can break off pieces of coral to sell to tourists in just a few seconds. It takes a great deal longer to replace them portance of protecting the envir\u00ad onment. For example, you can break off pieces of coral to sell to tourists in just a few seconds. It takes a great deal longer to re\u00ad place them. You have to educate the average citizen about the flora and fauna, the importance of waste disposal measures and the negative impacts of misusing local resources. We should be teaching resource management economics at all levels \u00ad from the policy advisors who inform decision\u00adma\u00ad kers about the value of their natural resources to the stake\u00ad holders living in the local commu\u00ad nity. And it needs to be done in a way that is easily understandable. \u25a0 For politicians, with limited terms of office, sustainable tour\u00ad ism development policies may seem too long\u00adterm to produce the concrete results they are look\u00ad ing for? \u00ad Yes, it is always tempting to go for short\u00adterm economic gains but the social costs can end up being greater, even if they are not immediately visible. As I said, there are no quick fixes. If you are in politics, decisions should be taken to benefit the voters in the long\u00adterm, not merely to further one's career. But I think we should give the electorate some credit. Voters have the common sense to appreciate good decision\u00admaking. They are the ones who suffer most the adverse consequences of short\u00ad termism. In Barbados, we have had to spend a lot of money to devel\u00ad op our coastal conservation pro\u00ad grammes. Some of the damage has been due to natural events but a lot can also be attributed to poor planning practices. The checks and balances must put be in place as soon as possible if such mistakes are not to be repeated. \u25a0 What does the future hold for Small Island Developing States? \u00ad Clearly defined policy guidelines for sustainable tourism development are the sine qua non for the future development of tourism in island communities. It is just as important as having sound financial planning in the sector. I know that the Caribbean Tourism Organisation has already recognised this 1 . In the context of the post\u00ad Lom\u00e9 negotiations, the private\u00ad sector development negotiating group is looking at tourism. The existing convention on SIDS and the environment could also be drawn on to specify sustainable development measures within the post\u00adLom\u00e9 agreement. Given the vulnerability of small island states, and their small economies, ultimately, I would like to see an ACP/SIDS taskforce to look at some of the issues we have c o v e r e d. ^B Interview by CO. 1 The CTO held its third annual sustainable tourism development conference in Suri\u00ad name in April. The main theme was 'Work\u00ad ing together \u00ad Keeping the right balance'. I the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "Joint Assembly in Strasbourg 'Towards a s t r e n g t h e n ed p a r t n e r s h i p' I The 28th session of the ACP\u00ad I EU Joint Assembly was held I at the end of March in I Strasbourg, in a relaxed, I convivial atmosphere. This I penultimate meeting before I the expiry of Lom\u00e9 IV was, I once again, an opportunity I for representatives of the I Convention's 86 member I countries to reaffirm the I principles and objectives B Bi they would like to see in\u00ad cluded in a future partnership. The ongoing talks were, therefore, the backdrop for the many proposals put forward at this forum. Themes such as poverty alleviation, conflict prevention and management, and human rights were debated in depth and will doubtless be corner\u00ad stones of the next ACP\u00adEU accord. At the start of the proceed\u00ad ings, David Mogami (Botswana), Co\u00ad President of the Assembly, sought to put the issues in context, noting that the aim of ACP\u00adEU relations is to achieve a strong partnership sup\u00ad ported by profound political dialo\u00ad gue, effective development coopera\u00ad tion and beneficial economic and trade relations. Although, in his opinion, the overall achievements of the Lom\u00e9 Convention did not deserve to be called into question, some of its provisions had never\u00ad theless not been implemented en\u00ad tirely successfully. Cooperation in the next millennium should thus focus on eradicating poverty and integrat\u00ad ing ACP economies progressively into the global economy \u00ad through a better understanding on both sides of the criteria for applying the cooperation agreement and through more involvement on the part of civil society. Lord Plumb (EPP\u00ad UK) subsequently offered his diag\u00ad nosis of the social situation. He pointed out that millions of people lived in poverty, and this alone demonstrated the scale of the task still to be carried out. Lord Plumb also expressed satisfaction, however, at the progress that had been achieved since he took up his man\u00ad date as co\u00adPresident (this was his last session in this capacity). In conclud\u00ad ing five years of effective and loyal service to the Assembly, the British MEP's speech was broadly upbeat. He expressed the hope that he might be able to return in five years' time to assess how far ACP\u00adEU cooperation had progressed. He added that he would be extremely pleased to find the Assembly full of life and freely debating mutual problems, with less emphasis on poverty and conflict, the shadows of such problems having by then retreated. Speaking on behalf of the President of the European Parlia\u00ad ment, its Vice\u00adPresident, Antoni Gu\u00ad tierrez Diaz (EUL\u00adE), stressed the Parliament's unfailing support for ACP\u00adEU cooperation. In his opinion, the relationship contributed not just to European integration but also to better management of the globali\u00ad sation process by reducing disparities and helping create a fairer and more equitable world order. Although most speeches delivered at the opening ceremony emphasised the challenges facing those responsible for negotiating the next Convention, there was less agreement on the main issues to be tackled. In Dakar, Joint Assembly members gave their support to certain themes that fea\u00ad ture in the negotiations but Com\u00ad missioner Pinheiro recognised that there were still differences of opi\u00ad nion on a number of points. These included the incorporation of good governance (the proper manage\u00ad ment of public affairs) as an essen\u00ad tial element in the next Convention, selectivity when allocating funding, and trade questions. 'Outlawing' poverty Of all the topics tackled by the Assembly, poverty was undoubt\u00ad edly the one that most united those present \u00ad at least in their desire to eradicate that scourge. Members listened attentively to the report delivered by the general rapporteur, Carlos Robles Piquer (PES\u00ad\u0395). Having identified the parts of the world that are prey to this misfortune, including some in the West, the speaker considered the problems involved in drafting a precise defini\u00ad tion of poverty. He noted that its causes differed a lot from one region to another and that a specia\u00ad lised analytical approach was needed. The UNDP Human Develop\u00ad ment Report, he explained, dealt with more than simply 'monetary' poverty (lack of funds). It also cov\u00ad ered 'human poverty', which Mr Robles Piquer defined as a lack of choice and opportunity, depriving the individual of the right to live with dignity. He added that very different results could be obtained depending on the angle from which poverty was studied. A comparison of the indicators demonstrated that economic progress, and social pro\u00ad gress did not always go hand in hand. This apparent paradox was confirmed by Ghana's representa\u00ad tive, who commented that, despite his country's economic revival, pov\u00ad erty was still a very serious problem, particularly in rural areas. The rapporteur appreciated the 'consensus' that exists on the donor side in dealing with the problem overall. He went on to emphasise that strategies to eradi\u00ad cate poverty should concentrate on encouraging economic growth, aid to social sectors and the creation of 'safety nets'. Other speakers com\u00ad mended the quality of the report, while offering a variety of sugges\u00ad tions. Michael McGowan (PES\u00adUK) called for strengthened links and partnerships with civil society and for more emphasis on micro\u00adcredits and financing structures or loans for the poorest sections of the popula\u00ad tion. Mrs Dalami, Swaziland's Health and Social Affairs Minister, said it was important to ensure better use of the funds allocated to poverty alleviation, reminding those present that good governance was a pre\u00ad condition for this. Philip Lowe, representing the European Commission, stressed that the EU's policies under any new Convention would have to be geared towards eradicating poverty in ACP countries \u00ad but also in other regions of the world \u00ad if the in\u00ad cidence of poverty was to be halved by 2015. In his opinion, it was essential that there should be better coordination of the Union's aid with that of the Member States and other donors. The negative influence of the debt burden on growth targets the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 1 ",
        "a cp and on efforts to curb poverty was also cited by the Kenyan Minister, George Saitoti, who is President\u00adin\u00ad Office of the Council. The conversion of debt into land, according to Mr Koulibaly, Director of an ACP re\u00ad search centre, would enable peasant farmers to gain access to property without enriching the state. Such farmers, he observed, were the ma\u00ad jor contributors to GNP. Magda Aelvoet (Green\u00adB) expressed the view that the report should examine the impact of war on poverty. Development and conflict: an impossible combination The conflicts raging in a number of ACP regions and their terrible consequences were con\u00ad demned by MEPs during various debates. All agreed that it was impossible to achieve development in areas where warfare is rife, be\u00ad cause nothing is possible without peace. A number of speakers de\u00ad plored the fact that funds invested, and efforts made to develop infra\u00ad structures, had come to naught on account of conflict. Others empha\u00ad sised the role of arms sales during crises and called for stricter regula\u00ad tion of this trade. In this context, the negotiating mandate for the forth\u00ad coming accord with the ACP coun\u00ad tries should, as Wilfried Telk\u00e4mper (Green\u00adD) reminded members, con\u00ad tain references to disarmament and to spending on and trade in arms. Any provisions agreed would have to be complied with, he said. The meeting was attended by the UN Secretary\u00adGeneral's special represen\u00ad tative, Mr Otunu. His role is to defend children involved either di\u00ad rectly or indirectly in conflict, and he proposed a series of initiatives aimed at preventing the 'suffering and abominations' of which they are innocent victims. After his speech, the Assembly adopted a resolution on the situation of children in the ACP countries and called for clearly defined provisions aimed at guaran\u00ad teeing their rights to be included in the text of the next Convention. Although the topic of con\u00ad flict spurred Joint Assembly mem\u00ad bers to call for action, the nature of the action needed was more difficult to determine. This was illustrated in the speech by Aldo Ajello, the EU's special representative in the Great Lakes region. He noted resignation on the part of the international community and the United Nations, who were seeking to transfer crisis management to regional organisa\u00ad tions that were ill\u00adequipped to do the job. The latter, in turn, tried to offload the task to sub\u00adregional bodies that were even less well\u00ad equipped. Mr Ajello proposed an international conference on security and cooperation in the Great Lakes region, where all parties would be called upon to assume a degree of responsibility. He also suggested a summit of the countries in that area. In a similar vein, the Assembly adopted a resolution calling for talks among all those involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Denouncing the slowness of intervention procedures imple\u00ad mented by the international com\u00ad munity and the EU, Michel Rocard (PES\u00adF) expressed concern at the emergence of predatory economic and financial bodies interested mainly in natural resources and whose actions disrupt and impede progress towards peace. There was considerable consensus at the As\u00ad sembly over the need to devise a genuine crisis\u00adprevention policy, with regional monitors to enable future crises to be anticipated earlier and managed better. Nigeria and South Africa \u00ad grounds for satisfaction Since free and democratic elections had brought General Oba\u00ad sanjo to power, there has been a visible calming of attitudes within the European Parliament towards Nigeria. A number of Joint Assembly representatives praised the advent of a new era for that country. After explaining the new government's ambitions, Nigeria's representative sought EU support in consolidating current progress. He added that, although Nigeria would certainly make mistakes in the future, it nevertheless needed encouragement and EU support. The Commission representative confirmed that coop\u00ad eration was progressively being re\u00ad sumed, although conditions deter\u00ad mining the release of the blocked funds still had to be defined. After four years of difficult negotiations, South Africa has now fully joined the Lom\u00e9 family follow\u00ad ing the signature of a trade agree\u00ad ment with the EU. The accord, signed in Berlin on 24 March, was dubbed by some speakers as a land\u00ad mark. According to Lord Plumb, the agreement would have significant repercussions on future ACP\u00adEU rela\u00ad tions, enhancing Southern Africa's development potential. In the opi\u00ad nion of Mrs Wieczoreck\u00adZeul (Ger\u00ad many), President of the Council, this was the first accord to be negotiated under WTO rules and it would also allow the signing of complementary agreements in the fields of fishing, wine and spirits. 90% of South Africa\u00adEU trade would henceforth be covered by the agreement and this would lead to greater stability for investment and to job creation. South Africa's ambassador stressed that other SADC and SACU countries had nothing to fear from the agree\u00ad ment, because steps had been taken to help them adapt and to protect the fragile industries of certain members. The accord is due to enter into force in January 2000. Ongoing support for regional cooperation Assembly members accepted the report compiled by John Corrie (EPP\u00adUK) on regional cooperation, confirming their desire to see this subject fully reflected in the next Convention. Regional cooperation is seen as a way to face up to globa\u00ad lisation, provided a flexible ap\u00ad proach is adopted and consideration is given to the specific nature of each region. The view was ex\u00ad pressed, however, that any such approach should not affect the over\u00ad all partnership with the ACP coun\u00ad tries. Although regional cooperation might be easy to achieve, regional integration was much more difficult according to the rapporteur. Accord\u00ad ing to Philip Lowe, the aim of this kind of cooperation is to enable countries to put their comparative advantages to best use in promoting development in the ACP countries. For this reason, the EU's approach needed to be pragmatic. The Assembly also discussed other important subjects, including climate change, fisheries, the future of ACP\u00adEU relations, the thorny problem of trade agreements (parti\u00ad cularly regarding bananas) vis\u00ad\u00e0\u00advis the WTO, and the situation in certain countries. In total, 21 resolu\u00ad tions on diverse subjects were adopted. Notably, Sudan escaped further condemnation. The next Joint Assembly will be held in Octo\u00ad ber, in the Bahamas. \u039c \u03ba.\u03ba. I the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "A n g o l a 's t r o u b l es a nd Europe's r e s p o n s i b i l i t i es by Bram Posthumus* Midway through 1998, the United Nations observer mission ordered aeroplanes once again to corkscrew-nosedive into the cities and towns in the interior of Angola. It was an ominous reminder of times past, when UNITA rebels could take out any plane with their anti\u00ad aircraft equipment and rain fire on any town, virtually at will. They can indeed do so again. We are back in the situation of about five years ago, during the 'cities war' of 1992-94. An inhabi tant of Kuito, the capital of the central province of Bie, was there throughout the shelling, when UNITA laid siege to the town for nine months. 'They bombed this town like mad,' he says. 'There were times that you could not see the other side of the street for the smoke from the explosions.' A woman who still lives in her bul let-riddled flat in nearby Huambo, capital of Huambo province, found herself in the frontline, during the 58-day war in the town. 'There were bullets flying everywhere. The only place that was safe for us was the corridor. So we slept there.' She points at a tiny space in the centre of the flat, not larger than a small conference table. Everyone remembers the hunger, which forced people out of the relative safety of their homes and onto the streets where there were snipers and landmines and where shells could fall. 30,000 people died in Kuito alone during the siege. 'This town was like one big cemetery,' recalls the same Kuito resident who lives close to a shelled-out flat. 'Where can you go?,' he asks rhetorically. Five years on, Kuito still looked like a ghost town, albeit with people in it. Many are refugees, who were in need of food aid. Renewed fight ing in December cut Kuito off; UNITA shells have rained down one again, causing yet more da mage to the already battered city. * Freelance journalist based in the Nether lands specialising in West and Southern Africa. The 1992-94 war broke out seven months after The Courier had left Luanda on an optimistic note. This magazine was not the only one to think that things would finally start looking up for Angola. 'We really believed in peace at the time,' remembered a radio journalist in Luanda. 'We were very, very optimistic.' And so was everyone: local people, most observers and all those who came to watch the Angolan miracle of 1992, ignoring the more ominous parts of the speeches by UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, and the fact that demobilisation and disarma ment were far from complete. Journalists and diplomats alike now look back in amazement, asking themselves how they could have been so wrong. The blame has, of course, to be laid at the door of the same people who have finally managed to derail the second Angolan peace process after four years and a fortnight. In November 1994, the Secretary-General of UNITA, Eugenio Manuvakola, and the Angolan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ven\u00e2ncio de Moura, signed the Lusaka Protocol, mark ing the beginning of that peace process. It was concluded after protracted negotiations while 1000 people were dying every day as a result of the intense fighting. Under its terms, the two armies would be demobilised and encamped, confidence-building measures would be carried out, people would again be free to move wherever they wanted and the UN would oversee the transi tion until a democratically elected government was put in place. That was the theory. In practice, both sides have stalled the process time and again, Girl in the Mbanza Congo Hospital The tragic cycle of war has returned to Angola blaming one another for the end less delays in carrying out the terms of the Protocol. UNITA never demobilised, the government never recalled its notorious armed police - both stocked up on arms and prepared for war. The UN in Angola, under the spirited leader ship of the indefatigable Malian diplomat. Ma\u00eetre Alioune Blondin Beye, tried to keep the two sides on board, but full compliance with the Lusaka Protocol was simply never achieved. The UN has been criticised for being far too lenient with both sides - but since Angola is not Iraq or Kosovo, no war- planes have been on standby to try and bomb the two rivals into compliance. When Beye died in an aircrash in June 1998, the hawks felt free to pursue their belligerent objectives. That was the beginning of the end of the second Angolan peace process. It must be said, in all fair ness, that inside UNITA and the MPLA-dominated government, there have been people who gen uinely wanted an end to the fight ing. One big mistake made in Europe, according to Fernando Pacheco, director of a major An- the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "a c \u03c1 golan development NGO is to see both sides as monoliths. 'When you talk with Europeans, you fre\u00ad quently hear 'The MPLA is left\u00ad wing and UNITA is right\u00adwing'. It's not true. In the MPLA, there are people who are much more right\u00ad wing than UNITA... and even when the MPLA presented itself as a Marxist party, you had people in UNITA who were much more Marxist...' The same goes for the hawks and the doves. There were people on both sides who believed dialogue was the only way for\u00ad ward. The small UNITA\u00adheld town of Cazombo, near the Zambian border, was declared a peace zone in mid\u00ad1998, with the active con\u00ad sent of the local UNITA official. Among the small group of people who run government\u00adheld Angola, President Dos Santos long held on to the idea of keeping the lines of communication w i th Savimbi open. But in the end, the inevita\u00ad ble conclusion was that the peace process was going nowhere. On December 4, 1998, on the eve of a major MPLA Congress in Luanda, the government began its ill\u00adcon\u00ad ceived offensive. Now, in January 1999, we are back to where we were in 1992. UNITA has laid siege to at least four towns (Huambo, Kuito, Luena and Malanje), the government army is looking for ways to reinforce itself and beat back the rebels \u00ad and the people are once again trapped in the middle, trying to get by. The National Bank of An\u00ad gola is still the pink coloured centrepiece of the elegant boule\u00ad vard of Luanda, that runs from the port to the old slave castle. The boulevard, named Avenida 4 Fe\u00ad vereiro (the date of the beginning of the uprising that brought the country independence) has re\u00ad cently been given a much\u00adneeded facelift: a new pavement, lights, a bit of decoration and new benches. But that is exactly what it is: a face\u00adlift. One street away from the waterfront, the despe\u00ad rate state of the city and its people are all too obvious. The smell of rotting waste is everywhere. Chil\u00ad dren walk in rags and sell cigar\u00ad ettes, newspapers, sweets and the like. People amble alongside the incessant noisy traffic jams, beg\u00ad ging for money or food. Many have one or more limbs missing, blasted off by a landmine some\u00ad where in Angola's vast interior. These people used to sleep on the sand next to the boulevard, until the refurbishment started. Now they are scattered across Luanda's unfinished high\u00adrise buildings. And just behind the Bank of Angola and the adjacent Bank of Savings and Credit is the Rua Sequiera Lukoki, where the women who control the money\u00ad changing business in central Luan\u00ad da literally fight over the 100 dollar bills that visitors bring. 'You see me here next time,' is the friendly advice you get after one transaction; you ignore it at your peril. In Angola, two\u00adthirds of the population get by on less than one US dollar a day. It gives them hardly any spending power: on the vast and busy city markets people buy their food supplies by the day \u00ad there is no money to buy more. One observer said: 'The edge of survival that people are sitting next to is coming closer.' When the war broke out again, food prices in Huambo, for exam\u00ad ple, went up by 100%. For ordin\u00ad ary townsfolk that means only one thing: no food. One aid worker commented after spending many years in the country: 'You know something... I still don't under\u00ad stand how Angolans survive, I simply don't understand...'. The answer is quite plainly that they don't. Life expectancy at birth is now 47.4 years, that is on average 30 years less than in the European Union. The story of the big econ\u00ad omy, meanwhile, is well\u00adknown. Angola produces some of the world's best oil and finest dia\u00ad monds, sells them onto the world market \u00ad legally in the case of oil, largely illegally in the case of diamonds \u00ad and buys arms from the proceeds in order to wage war. Hardly anything goes towards improving the country's crumbling infrastructure, education and Preparations for Independence Day celebrations in Huambo. There isn't much for ordinary people to celebrate, as the economy crumbles health care systems. There is no investment in genuine indigenous production. What is still function\u00ad ing is kept alive by local and foreign NGOs and the churches. The first major city development in Luanda since independence is the massive 12\u00adstorey diamond sorting centre commissioned by De Beers, in anticipation of the govern\u00ad ment's renewed control of UNITA\u00ad held diamond areas in the east of the country. Oil investment is booming off\u00adshore, quite unper\u00ad turbed by developments inland. Industries on\u00adshore have all but collapsed. The big economy has no connection with the people's econ\u00ad omy other than what is being sold by the few food and beverages industries that are still running and what is stolen from the ports for re\u00adsale on the informal mar\u00ad kets. Angola mattered in 1992, as The Courier rightly asserted, and it matters still. It is Africa's second largest oil producer and there are several major European companies involved in the exploi\u00ad tation of the ever\u00adexpanding reco\u00ad verable reserves. Diamonds still find their way, legally and illegally, into the world's largest diamond cutting centre, Antwerp. The country is still paying back its huge $7bn foreign debt. And it con\u00ad tinues to produce large numbers of refugees who knock on foreign doors for assistance. Angola also has a young, emerging civil society \u00ad trade unions, human rights or\u00ad ganisations and some independent media \u00ad who are attempting to find new ways out of the agony that has been a regular visitor to these shores for almost 40 years.

        "Island uses insects to d e f e at i n v a d i ng pest by Darryl Dean* Gardeners in Trinidad began noticing the danger signs about three years ago: deformed fruits and flowers on trees and insects overrunning plants, their leaves curled and bunched together in rosette-like fashion. The invading bugs, wrapped in their white cotton-like shrouds, spread at an alarming rate through various parts of the country. The pest - identified as the hibiscus 1 mealybug or maconellicoccus hirsutus (green) I - posed a growing threat to food crops, jj ornamental plants and forests. It also dis rupted inter-island trade in the region. If the bug had managed to spread and get out of control in the Caribbean, officials say it would have had a tremendous impact on the price of fruit and vege tables. But today, it is reported to be under control in Trinidad & Tobago, and the government's handling of the problem is widely regarded as a success story. 'So successful has it been that the scientific community in the region has taken an interest in our management strategy,' said Cynthra Persad, coordi nator of the pest control programme run by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture Minister, Reeza Mohammed cites studies showing that the agricultur al sector would have suffered losses amounting to TT$700 million (\u20ac102m) over a period of about three years had the government not taken the necessary action to deal with the pest. 'We have brought the pest to the level where it is causing no negative economic impact on the agricultural community,' Mr Mohammed said. Sugar, cocoa, coffee, fruits and vegetables are among the country's main exports. Mr Mohammed also noted that his ministry had been providing technical assistance to several countries in the Caribbean affected by the pest and that officials from Latin America had visited Trinidad & Tobago for first-hand information about the systems which the country developed to deal with the problem. Countries all around the world threa tened by the bug could benefit from Trinidad's experience. Veterinarian Vincent Moe, an adviser to the Agriculture Ministry, noted that the hibiscus mealy bug entered Trinidad at the wharves, with produce from neighbouring Grenada where the pest has caused widespread damage. In 1995, several Carib bean countries suspended the import of farm pro ducts from Grenada, and Trinidad & Tobago. Mean while, local plant protection regulations were * Trinidad-born journalist and broadcaster based in Canada. Text supplied by Gemini News Agency, 9 White Lion Street, London, N1 9PD. amended to require import permits for all fruits, vegetables and planting materials. In September 1995, agriculture ministers of the Caribbean and the Americas declared the hibiscus mealybug a new pest in the western hemisphere and a regional action plan was set up with the long-term goal of achieving sustainable control of the pest. 'As long as the insect is present in one country in the region, every other country is at risk', said an Agriculture ministry official in Port of Spain. Among the projects included in the action plan were developing a regional capability for identifying the pest and its natural enemies, the upgrading of plant quarantine facilities and the mounting of information and public awareness programmes. Trinidad began its action plan with a campaign to inform citizens about the newly-discov ered bugs. It also intensified plant quarantine measures and introduced a pest-control programme. At first, it tried the more traditional method of pest control: slashing and burning the infested plants and spraying the infested areas with chemicals. But this proved ineffective. No chemical pesticide could penetrate the waxy covering with which the insects protect themselves. 'We realised that we had to introduce mea sures which would destroy the bugs but not harm the environment', said Cynthra Persad. 'So an integrated pest management control programme was launched.' The major focus was the use of biological control agents, this being considered 'the best long-term option'. Ms Persad explained that the type of mealy bug discovered in Trinidad & Tobago and other Caribbean countries is commonly found in tropical Africa, South-East Asia and Northern Australia. Re searchers went looking for the pest's natural enemies - other insects which would destroy the hibiscus mealybug. They found three: the Indian and Austra lian beetles and Asian wasps. The predatory beetles feed on the bugs at all stages of their development, while the parasitic wasps puncture the adult bugs and feed on the oozing body fluids. The female wasps also lay their eggs inside the bugs, preventing them from developing further. Researchers studied, reared and multiplied the beetles and wasps before releasing them at several sites with heavy mealybug infestations. 'The releases were highly successful. The beetles and wasps immediately went on the rampage, attacking the bugs,' Ms Persad said. As part of the Agriculture Ministry's plan to make the bio-pesticides more accessible to farmers, several centres to produce the beetles and wasps were set up in different parts of the country. Huge samaan trees became ideal locations for the multi plication of the beetles. 'These magnificent trees, 40 or 50 years old, with broad canopies, were susceptible to the hibiscus mealybug,' Ms Persad said. 'We did lose some samaan trees during the early stages of the mealybug attack but what was remarkable about the predator beetles was that they found these trees to be excellent places' for producing more beetles. 'We were able to collect the larvae at those locations and move them to other sites where they were needed.' M D.D. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "Kl The Euro a nd its significance f or t he ACP c o u n t r i es By Dr Francisco Granell* I On the first working day I after the 'conversion week- I end' of 31 December 1998 to I 4 January 1999, Europe's fi- I nancial markets opened to a I new era: the era of the Euro | as a new single European I currency. The new currency I has very important implica- I tions for the ACP countries I given that the European I Union is their most impor- I tant export market for ^ ^^ goods and tourism, as well as being the single largest source of grant aid. Against this back ground, the advent of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) not only changes the world's financial landscape, it also has an effect on the monetary competitiveness of nations and firms trading in the global markets in Euros, US dollars, Japanese yen or other currencies. While the 15 EU Member States have some 375 million in habitants, the 11 countries of the Eurozone have a total population of 292 million, outnumbering the 268 million Americans. At $8.1 trillion in 1997, the USA's GDP is bigger than Euroland's $6.2 tril lion, but the latter accounts for 18.8% of world exports compared with 14.0% for the US. In this context I think it is useful to explain how the Euro came into being, its present reality and its implications. The steps towards the Euro The introduction of the single currency came after years of European monetary coopera tion. Looking back at the integra tion process, it is possible to identify three stages, which partly overlap, and which have led to the emergence of the EU as a highly integrated economy. * Chief Adviser, European Commission. The first phase (1958-93) led the EU from the completion of the Customs Union (1958-69) to the effective dismantling of all obstacles to the free movement of goods, labour and capital. Inter nal border controls were sup pressed on 1 January 1993. In the process, the EU has emerged as the largest global trading power in the world. The second phase (1989-99) was the passage to EMU. It began with the Madrid European Council of June 1989, which adopted the principle of creating a monetary union with a common currency. In fact, this objective had already been set out in the Werner Plan of the early 1970s, whose major step was the establishment (in 1979) of the European Monetary System (EMS). Pivotal to this sec ond phase was the creation of the ECU from a basket of European currencies. The process of achieving monetary union formally began with the full removal of exchange controls in July 1990. The culmina tion, following an arduous process of cuts in public deficits and the lowering of inflation (in accor dance with strict convergence cri teria fixed by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty on European Union) was the replacement of the currencies of 11 EU Member States by a single currency at the beginning of 1999. The third phase began on January 1 this year with the im plementation of a common mone tary policy aimed at ensuring stable prices, and conducted by an independent European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB, in fact, began operating in July 1998, taking over from the European Monetary Institute. It is responsi ble for issuing the Euro. National fiscal policies will be strictly coordinated by the EU Council on the basis of the Growth and Stability Pact. This was agreed, in principle, in Dublin in December 1996, to ensure the coordination required by Article 103 of the Maastricht Treaty. The treaty arti cle obliges EMU countries to main tain prudent fiscal policies aimed at balancing the budget over the long term and strictly limiting their public deficits in future. The UK, Denmark, Sweden and Greece have not joined the Eurozone at this stage. They may do so later, provided they satisfy the convergence criteria. In this case, a decision on admission will formally be taken by the European Council, based on a proposal by the Commission. This is the same procedure that was used in May 1998 when the 11 EU countries presently in the Euro were authorised to participate in the launch of the single currency. As Commission President, Jacques Santer, said at the time of the launch, 'the Euro is more than just an economic instrument. It heralds a new departure for Europe.' It is clear that the Euro takes the EU on to a new plane, both within its own territory and in its dealings with the rest of the world. The 11 founder members have taken the first steps towards coordinating economic policies, creating an 'emerging system of economic policy coordination' working through the Euro-Council (finance ministers) and the Eco nomic and Financial Committee (senior officials from finance min istries, national central banks, the Commission and the ECB). The introduction of the Euro The name of the single currency was decided at the Eur opean Council in Madrid in De cember 1995. Political and techni cal discussions about the Euro have dominated the economic de bate in Europe in recent years. Meanwhile, strong economic activ ity in 1998 helped to reduce infla tion and budget deficits, and de liver a welcome reduction in un employment, which fell below 10% for the first time since 1992. 1 the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "e u r o pe These positive results owed much to the sound economic prepara tions for EMU and provided the backdrop for the successful launch of the new currency at the begin ning of this year, despite a difficult external environment (the eco nomic crisis in Asia and Latin America). The national currencies of the 11 participating countries are now irrevocably locked into the Euro. In effect, these currencies - which will continue circulating until the introduction of Euro notes and coins during the first six months of 2002 - have become subsidiaries or fractions of the single currency. In accordance with the rules set out in the Maastricht Treaty, the irrevocable rates for converting the national currencies into Euros (and vice versa) were fixed by the Council of Ministers on 31 December 1998, based on a proposal by the Commission, after consultation with the European Central Bank. The method used in setting the rates was designed to ensure that the Euro had the same value as the now abolished ECU (see page 93 of Courier n\u00b0 174 for details of the irrevocable exchange rates). The currencies of Denmark, Greece, Sweden and the UK are not included in EMU initially, partly because of domestic con cerns about ceding certain key attributes of sovereignty such as the issuing of currency and the setting of monetary policy. January 1 also saw the introduction of a new Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM 2). This links the Danish krone and the Greek drachma to the Euro. Following agreement between the ECB and the two National Central Banks, the drach ma was given the standard \u00b1 15% fluctuation band, while a nar rower \u00b1 2.25% band was estab lished for the Danish currency. During the long weekend straddling the New Year, financial professionals and institutions worked to adapt their systems to the new currency. When trading began again, a large mass of monetary and financial market operations began taking place in Euros. Despite some fears of mar ket instability in advance of the day, the fixing of the conversion rates on 31 December turned out to be almost a non-event. The markets were quiet because, given the uncertainty about how the payments system would work, few traders were keen to engage in large transactions whose settle ment would have taken place during the first business days of 1999. The conversion weekend went smoothly as did the subse quent opening of Europe's finan cial markets. No significant chan geover problems were reported by the commercial financial sector, and the new cross-border settle ment system, TARGET, began oper ating with only minor initial glitches. The ECB conducted its first main refinancing operation on 5 January. \u20ac75 billion was allotted to 944 banks which had submitted bids to the ECB's marginal lending facility for a total of \u20ac482 billion in order to combat a tight liquidity situation. Private operators are not obliged to switch over to the Euro until 2002 but many of them decided to do at the outset. All the stock exchanges of the Eurozone decided to list, trade and process stocks and securities in the single currency from 4 January. The London and Stockholm stock exchanges are also offering the possibility of quoting certain secu rities in Euros. The impact of the Euro Macroeconomic level Until the end of the transi tion period on December 31, 2001, when the Euro becomes manda tory, the principle of 'no compul sion/no prohibition' will apply, meaning that transactions in Euros will coexist with transactions in national currencies linked by the irrevocable rates fixed on 31 De cember. The Euro is being used by central banks as the official reserve currency in much the same way as the dollar. In the context of EMU, it has been confirmed that the Eur opean Central Bank has the role of stabilising interest rates on the money markets, making the sys tem more able to absorb liquidity shocks and increasing the level of liquidity in the banking system. The ECB can now launch short- term refinancing operations to enable commercial banks to ob tain funds from the ECB in ex change for depositing appropriate securities as collateral. As of 1 January, the ECB has the power to sanction finan cial operators who do not respect their obligations. The Bank has also adopted a system for gather ing the statistics needed for im plementing its monetary policy. Now that the right eco nomic fundamentals, including low inflation rates, are ensured, it is up to the market to determine the equilibrium rate of the Euro against the dollar and the yen. But while future prospects for the Euro look very positive, one should not overlook the considerable challenges that will confront the new monetary union. The first challenge is the fact that, in the EMU policy mix, fiscal matters will largely remain in the hands of the individual EU member states. Second, while the EU budget (1.27% of the Union's total GNP) is an important tool for addressing structural imbalances between member countries, it is not sufficiently large to be used as a cyclical safety net for the effects of possible asymmetric shocks to national economies. Third, cross- border labour mobility and the flexibility of national real wages are not yet hallmarks of EU eco nomics. In optimal currency areas, these make it possible to abandon nominal exchange rates as a de vice for absorbing asymmetric shocks and easing real adjust ments. In this context, European institutions have a heavy agenda ahead of them. They must ensure close cooperation and a smooth transfer of competences, policies and policy instruments from the Member States and national cen- the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "e u r o pe tral banks to the EU and ECB - in line with the idea of revitalising the European integration model. Microeconomic level The Euro will play a role commensurate to that of the dol lar in world trade and financial markets, and will gradually be adopted by economic operators as a currency through which trade may be conducted, and in which financial assets may be denomi nated. European consumers will need to learn how to calculate and shop in a new currency. For companies and business, EMU also entails big changes. By eliminating distortions and differences that used to be hidden by currency fluctuations, it creates a level playing field in which everything - prices, costs, taxes and social security payments - becomes in stantly comparable from one country to another. The Euro opens up a much wider market with stronger competition. Some European multina tional firms have indicated that they want suppliers to invoice them in Euros and a handful of companies have already begun to integrate the new currency into their operations. Most business sectors, however, will only make the transition once some of the major players have decided to shift, taking their customers and suppliers with them. It is all a question of critical mass. The Euro deprives govern ments of the possibility of devalu ing their currency to 'jumpstart' the economy. It increases pressure for tough structural reforms - which may change the existing framework for firms. In certain commodity mar kets currently priced in dollars, the impact of the Euro is likely to be limited. Oil and other commodity producers could decide to denomi nate their goods in Euros, but studies on the international use of currencies suggest that inertia and/or tradition play an important role in sustaining the status quo. Taking all these elements into account, it is clear, however, that the Euro is not just another foreign currency. It represents a real change in the business envir onment. The Euro as an international currency One key q u e s t i on is whether the Euro will eventually develop into an important inter national currency - and whether this is desirable for Europe and the rest of the world. In the past, the 'internationalisation' of a currency has generally begun with the 'private means of payment' func tion. It was the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates against the dollar, coupled with the Marshall Plan, which boosted the USA's role as the major suppli er of goods to Europe, and turned the dollar into the 'universal' cur rency. Today, capital flows are 40 times larger than trade flows. Thus, the most important 'means of payment' function is the use of the international currency in trans actions between third currencies. The key determinants are the size of the market and the aforemen tioned inertia/tradition. An estab lished international currency ben efits from positive externalities stemming from lower transaction costs, lower information costs and network effects. Conversely, an emerging currency with interna tional ambitions, like the Euro, is faced with indirect effects in its internationalisation process. This applies particularly to the poten tial use of the Euro as a reference currency for the quotation of raw material prices. The second determining element is the use of the interna tional currency as a 'store of value' (composition of official reserves, composition of the debt of LDCs and of Central and Eastern Eur opean countries, etc). In this sense the diversification of foreign-ex change reserves in favour of the Euro will depend on: - whether it is increasingly used by foreign-exchange markets as an intervention instrument, and as an invoicing currency in world trade; - the 'Euro-intrinsic' qualities de monstrated to the markets by the ECB's commitment to stable prices; - the use of the Euro in the denomination of international fi nancial transactions; - the political will of authorities to diversify to the Euro to avoid over- dependence on the US dollar. The third element is the use of the international currency as a unit of account in the post- Bretton Woods system in which crawling-pegs, managed floats and floating regimes have ex panded in absolute terms, obliging economic actors to try to reduce exchange rate risk and volatility. It is difficult to assess the hierarchy in the functions of the international currency because of the inertia (the larger the market today, the larger the market to morrow), the exchange risks and the network effects. The dollar is still the most important international currency. Currency diversification has taken place since 1973, but at a slow pace. Such diversification is more dynamic for the 'store of value' function than for the others (such as the invoicing practices of multi nationals). The Euro's future will also be influenced by the pegging strategy of third countries. Most Asian and Latin American curren cies are pegged, in nominal or real terms, to the dollar. This is despite the fact that since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods regime, the dollar has ceased to be the institu tional key currency of the interna tional currency system. European integration and the emergence of Japan as a major economic and financial power have not led to a significant decline in the international use of the US currency. The Deutsche mark and the yen play a modest international role, especially as means of payment and as units of account. Up to 1999, the mark was the de facto anchor currency for western Europe. Some observers have suggested that, by replacing the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS with full economic and monetary union, the EU is effec tively substituting the Euro for the DM and the European Central Bank for the Bundesbank. In doing so, they say, it is 'buying' the Bundesbank's credibility on low inflation, fiscal stability and wage growth in line with productivity. In this context, the grow ing unification of Europe's capital markets and the future enlarge ment of the Eurozone (and the EU itself) should boost the role of the Euro as a currency of denomina tion for foreign financing - even if t the Courier n\" 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "e u r o pe the dollar retains some advantage in terms of transaction costs \u00ad provided that the currency is a solid nominal anchor. But the extent to which the Euro emerges as an international currency will depend very much on the position taken by the ECB as regards its own targets and on the loss of control of the money supply. About 60% of the US dol\u00ad lars in circulation are held by foreigners. General de Gaulle re\u00ad ferred to this as a 'huge privilege allowing the US to run\u00adup external deficits and buy European indus\u00ad try'. But the US encountered a problem in controlling the money supply with the development of the 'Euromarkets'. The implications of an in\u00ad ternational Euro for Europe's cur\u00ad rent account and for the Euro: dollar exchange rate still have to be analysed in depth. Assuming the 1960s dollar model is followed, to allow the use of the European currency in international transac\u00ad tions and provide enough liquidity for the international monetary system, the EU's balance of pay\u00ad ments basic account would have to move from surplus to deficit. A conflict may emerge here between the ECB objectives of maintaining low inflation and making the Euro a strong and stable currency on the one hand, and the possibility of a large EU external deficit to provide liquidity to third parties on the other. In this context, the Euro will also have implications for the EU's relationship with interna\u00ad tional institutions responsible for improving the stability of the international monetary system (mainly G7, G10, the Bank for International Settlements and the IMF). Although the most likely scenario is that the current ar\u00ad rangement of floating but mana\u00ad ged exchange rates will be main\u00ad tained, EMU should encourage symmetry in the international monetary system. This should en\u00ad hance the benefits, allow for a more efficient distribution of ben\u00ad efits derived from international economic coordination and contri\u00ad bute to greater exchange rate stability. In this sense, the German government has launched the idea of a new international financial 'architecture' with a common strategy on exchange rates cover\u00ad ing the USA, Japan and Europe. But global efforts to reform the structure of the international fi\u00ad nancial system are hampered by substantial differences of opinion among senior world policy\u00admakers about how to restore confidence after the Asian, Russian and Brazi\u00ad lian financial crises. In any case, the develop\u00ad ment of the Euro into a major international currency will be gra\u00ad dual, but relatively more impor\u00ad tant in those countries that have close links with the EMU partici\u00ad pating countries. The Euro and the ACP Group In terms of relations with the EU and the Eurozone, the ACP Group is not homogeneous. The USA is the most important eco\u00ad nomic and financial partner of most Caribbean countries while Japan and Australia are major partners for much of the South Pacific. The EU, through the Lom\u00e9 Convention, is the main grant\u00adaid donor for most ACPs. The development of the Euro's international role should first show itself in those countries that have close economic, trade and financial links with the EU, such as the states of Central and Eastern Europe (negotiating future membership of the EU) and certain Mediterranean and African coun\u00ad tries (the Euro is already the reference currency for the CFA franc zone). At the global level \u00ad including the ACP countries \u00ad the development will be more gra\u00ad dual, reflecting the inertia effects that have prolonged the interna\u00ad tional role of the dollar since the end of the Bretton Woods system. Logically, the effects should differ according to the share of economic and financial transactions that each ACP country has respectively with the USA, Japan, Australia, Canada and the Eurozone. Another factor will be the extent to which ACP central banks adopt the Euro as a reserve currency. The consequences of intro\u00ad ducing the Euro for countries that have trade, tourism and financial links with Europe are both direct and indirect. The direct effects relate to trade creation, trade diversion, and the impact of estab\u00ad lishing a single financial market in Euros for the foreign debt of non\u00ad EU countries. The indirect effects relate to the global or 'systemic' effects of the Euro as a new international currency. It is worth pointing out here that ACP states receive significant amounts of aid from the EU, and the denomina\u00ad tion of this aid has been switched from ECUs to Euros. ACP countries, especially those maintaining a close US dol\u00ad lar link, will be affected to the extent that the Euro would be more or less volatile against the other G3 currencies. The main question is whether the introduc\u00ad tion of the new currency will increase or reduce exchange rate volatility between the main inter\u00ad national currencies. Beyond volati\u00ad lity itself, ACP countries actively trading with the Eurozone have an interest in the movement of the Eurodollar and Euro:yen ex\u00ad change rates. There is no reason to expect that the Euro will be either too strong or too weak against any other currency. If the major partners also pursue sound policies, the result should be a stable Euro. Changes will happen gra\u00ad dually and in an orderly manner but, in any event, there will be a case for monitoring them to en\u00ad sure that any unwarranted impact of transitional effects is minimised. \u25a0 F.G the Courier n D 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 I ",

Although the scheme covers only 180 ha, it is already helping to revitalise the industry and has paved the way for irrigation development on other Windward Islands.

Keith Henderson, technologist on the EU-funded Deloitte Touche TA team supported him and a few weeks later, was heard to declare, 'above all else, I want this project to work!' Keith's firm commitment was later to play a major role in getting the project operational on time. Role of the EDF Unit The EDF/PMCU was estab lished to speed the development and implementation of projects from the 1994 Stabex allocation. By allowing technical assistance with experience of EC procedures to in terface closely with Government, it was hoped that commitment and disbursement could be accelerated.

It was four times the size of the National In dicative Programme and priority had to be given to helping the estimated 4000 banana farmers, who had suf fered the loss and would soon face open competition from larger scale, more efficient Latin American pro ducers.

We tried to keep the num\u00ad ber of initiatives small, so that the administrative burden would remain manageable. Therefore, we went for the maximum possible irrigated area of 1600 ha (4000 acres). The Stabex Committee approved our project idea the next day, but understand\u00ad ably wanted to see the results of a feasibility study first, before approv\u00ad ing an investment of \u20ac12m in irriga\u00ad tion. No time to lose However, waiting for a fea\u00ad sibility study would mean losing the next dry season (December 1997\u00ad April 1998) and probably a year. Having seen practical evidence that significant yield increases were pos\u00ad sible, we felt a 'faster track' ap\u00ad proach warranted investigation. On May 7, 1997, myself, Keith Hender\u00ad son, Ashley Caine of the SVBGA and Mr. Thoon from the Central Water and Sewerage Authority (CWSA) made a field trip to examine the potential of all the banana growing areas. On the way home, we all agreed that Rabacca Farms and Langley Park had the most potential, and we had enough historical infor\u00ad mation on dry season river flows to justify going ahead. We quickly wrote the pro\u00ad ject idea up as an emergency pro\u00ad ject, using the same summarised Project Cycle Management Format we had used to present the first project idea. We also stressed that this scheme was developed under leadership from the EDF/PMCU. Diplomacy This helped move 'owner\u00ad ship' quickly over to the Vincentian side. Karl John and Randolph Cato (the outgoing NAO), speedily brought their diplomatic skills to bear to convince the EC Delegation (situated in Barbados) that we had enough information to go forward. Being a shrewd administrator, Ran\u00ad dolph Cato also knew how to use 'pressure points' to get a decision. In his letter of June 6, he therefore asked for an answer by June 13, in view of his 'imminent departure' from post. Mr. Cato had already built up an excellent working relationship with George Gwyer, the Head of the EU Delegation in Bridgetown and with his predecessor Phillippe Dar\u00ad muzey. Fortunately, the latter was now back in Commission headquar\u00ad ters and in charge of the main division responsible for the Eastern Caribbean. A flurry of activity fol\u00ad lowed and, on June 12, 1997 we received a fax from the Delegation, which in diplomatic language said, 'go ahead, we will support you all the way.' Thereafter, Laura Anthony Browne took over the reigns as National Authorising Officer and proved within a very short space of time that she had all the diplomatic the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",

Using simple Gantt charts, we then drew up a schedule (see chart) which remained valid until the scheme was finally commis\u00ad sioned in April 1998. Commission support Procurement of irri\u00ad gation equipment was speeded up through an in\u00ad ternational pre-qualification exercise, launched with a pre-emptive clause (the Fi\u00ad nancing Agreement had yet to be signed) and with a 45- day bid period, approved by the Commission. By using e- mail, (copies to the Delega\u00ad tion), we were also able to get early approval of the supply tender dossier by the Commission's services. Thereafter approvals were always given quickly and promptly. We could not have achieved what we did without the support of both the Delegation and the Commission's services. The supply tender f or t he scheme was awarded on the day after the Financing Agreement was signed (1 November 1997). Containers with irri\u00ad gation equipment left Europe in early December and started to arrive (by banana boat), early in the New Year. While the equipment was being procured, the CWSA quietly went ahead with the construction of a diversion weir on the Langley Park river, together with a pipeline down to the irrigation scheme. The right TA Luckily, we knew a man who could design and supervise imple\u00ad mentation of the irrigation scheme. Phil Cooper had already demon\u00ad strated his skills on an EC project in China and had prior experience of tendering irrigation supplies under EC regulations. Ian Anderson, a civil engineer with experience in the organisational aspects of irrigation schemes was also selected to help. Both were recruited using direct agreement procedures and they ar\u00ad rived in July and August 1997. They worked well together and covered all the elements we needed to get a Financing Agreement signed at the second Stabex meeting on 31 Octo\u00ad ber 1997. Phil Cooper returned in Jan\u00ad uary 1998 to supervise installation and testing of the equipment, work- Edwin Vos, Rural Development Counselor at the EC Delegation in Barbados, examines high quality irrigated bananas on STEBIP at Langley Park, December 1998 ing alongside the newly recruited Vincentian project manager, Conrad Simon and two senior technicians. The scheme was finally commis\u00ad sioned in April 1998, less than a year from when the idea was first pro\u00ad posed. The situation today By December 1998, the ben\u00ad efits of irrigation were there for all to see. First crops of 32 tonnes per hectare (13 t/acre) are now being harvested and the quality of fruit, grown free of drought stress, is excellent. It is no surprise that participating farmers are quite will\u00ad ing to contribute to the costs of operations and maintenance (O&M). The biggest problem we now face is moving the increased volume of fruit from field to port, for the scheme is located some 30 km away from Kingstown (St Vin\u00ad cent's capital). So now we are busy improving local infrastructure - im\u00ad proving the roads on the scheme and pushing ahead with the design and construction of a 'reception and palletisation centre', so that fruit can be moved safely and economically along the winding and bumpy roads. The first phase of a new and larger project called the Stabex Fast Track Irrigation Project (STAFTIP) is also being implemented. This will extend irrigation to a further 530 hectares and will cost approximately \u20ac6.7m. The importance of ownership Many factors have contributed to our success, but most of all, we believe that Vincentian involvement from the start was the key, helped along by the EDF Unit. Everyone here is proud of the initiative. It shows through in the en\u00ad thusiasm of farmers for irri\u00ad gation, and particularly in the commitment of the SVBGA. They have ap\u00ad pointed one of their best extension officers, Leroy Jackson, to concentrate on the scheme and allowed a top extension agent, Cal- drick Browne, to become a senior irrigation technician. The Ministry of Agriculture and Labour has provided their only irrigation engineer, Conrad Simon. He now manages the scheme and is helping the CWSA develop an Irriga\u00ad tion and Management Unit (IMU). The General Manager of the SVBGA is always willing to show dignitaries around the scheme. And last, but not least, both the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister now rarely miss a chance to mention STEBIP and the contribution of Stabex funds from the EU to the upturn in their banana industry. \u039c J.T.

        "Country report Chad There are those countries where history seems to keep repeating itself. In many respects, Chad is one such country. The violent climate of its first 30 years as an independent nation could have been buried, once and for all, a thousand leagues under the desert sands; instead, rebel\u00ad lion rears its ugly head here and there, with inevitable consequences. Yesterday in the south, today in the extreme north: this persis\u00ad tent lack of security is just another hiccup in a hesitant democratic process. Violence reigns The former French colony of Chad gained independence on 11 August 1960. Its first Head of State was Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye, a member of parliament from the south of the country. When the colonists departed, they left the country with well\u00addefined borders, despite the fact that 'Chad' represents an assortment: a multitude of languages, ethnic groups, cultures and clans foreshadowed what was later to be called the 'north\u00adsouth divide'. At the time of indepen\u00ad dence, however, its peoples had to rally to\u00ad gether, to see beyond vested interests and dissimilarities. The PPT (Chad Progress Party) \u00ad the single party \u00ad in which people found a common cause, proved to be a major unifying influence. Yet a system of joint administration cannot just be conjured out of nothing, and it was not long before the divergence between north and south made an unwelcome reappearance. The regime soon came to be called a 'southern' dictatorship, infamous for its internal purges and brutal violations of rights. The political class in the north at once opted for dissidence, rebellion affecting the whole of the BET (Borkou\u00adEnnedi\u00ad Tibesti), an immense desert region on the border with Libya. The Frolinat (Chad National Libera\u00ad tion Front) was set up. The policy of national reconciliation implemen\u00ad ted in the early 1970s by Tombalbaye was unable to turn the tide of history. His influence was waning \u00ad he had already been ostracised by his supporters \u00ad and he was ousted from the presidency in April 1975 in a military coup d'etat. General F\u00e9lix Malloum took over power and set up the Higher Military Council, over which he presided and which was composed mostly of soldiers from the south. The clouds of war did not, however, disperse. Try as he might to attempt to bury the hatchet with the Frolinat, the new leader was doomed to fail. The situation grew worse from 1977, when a new player entered the scene: Libya. President Kadhafi offered the northern rebels military training and weapons, which led to another bloodbath. Although the Higher Mili\u00ad tary Council was rapidly losing ground, General Malloum nevertheless found an unexpected ally in the form of Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 \u00ad not a total unknown, since he had crashed onto the inter\u00ad national scene a few years earlier when, to\u00ad gether with his FAN (Northern Armed Forces), a dissident branch of the Frolinat, he took the French archaeologist, Fran\u00e7oise Claustre, hos\u00ad tage. Resolutely anti\u00adLibyan, Habr\u00e9 signed an agreement with the Higher Military Council, the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 \u0392 ",
        "which granted him de facto the status of 'friend in need', the only one capable of reconciling the country's numerous factions. A Basic Charter was formulated in August 1978, with Malloum stay ing on as President, but henceforth aided by Habr\u00e9 as Prime Minister. Malloum and Habr\u00e9, south and north called upon to rule together - yet another illusion. The relationship between the two men, both intoxi cated with power, was a stormy one. There were sporadic uprisings throughout the country and in February 1979, Chad's army and the FAN were back to back. The spiral of violence started up even worse than ever, each day's events more terrible and more cruel than the last. 'Black September' saw southerners hunted in the north, Muslims run to earth in the south. Inexorably, N'Djamena was divided up, as was the whole of Chad, between war leaders and brothers now enemies: Malloum, Habr\u00e9 and, now Goukouni Ouedde'i, leader of the Libyan- backed wing of the Froli nat. Thousands of deaths later, Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 and his FAN finally took over power in June 1982. A new, unifying party was born - t he UNIR (National Union for Independence and Revolution). Heads or tails? A promising ser ies of actions and na tional reconciliation pro jects? Or ferocious parti sanship? Par for the course, Pavlov could have come from Chad, as a new rebellion, this time fermented in the south by the famous codos (commandos), broke out. Even more Pavlovian merciless repression was just around the corner. And so the cycle continued: summary execu tions, entire villages burnt to the ground, torture. Massacres of the local population also continued, until those in the Moyen-Chari, in the two Logones, N'Djamena and Gu\u00e9ra merged into one. Habr\u00e9 had an exclusive hold on power, and his regime was to claim 40,000 victims. Disturbances flared up again and again. In 1987, he was almost beaten by Goukouni, who was still receiving a great deal of assistance from Libya. He survived only through the mass intervention of French troops and was thereby able to consolidate his power over practically all of Chad's territory. Nevertheless, in Chad, history does have an infuriating tendency to repeat itself. In 1989, one of his faithful lieutenants deserted him and took refuge in Sudan. Sup ported by the former codos, Idriss D\u00e9by took N'Djamena without resistance on 1 December 1990. His programme was clear and concise: 'I am not bringing Chad's people either water or money, only freedom'. Freedom... 'When we heard this speech, we leapt at it. D\u00e9by was promising us freedom and we took him at his word', Oulatar Begoto, editor of N'Djamena Hebdo told us. Was the gentle breeze of democracy finally going to sweep away all trace of violence? Perhaps. Souvenir de Habr\u00e9.. A shaky democracy With Habr\u00e9 gone, the 1990s were to dawn amid a climate of enthusiasm. Human rights organisa tions and trades unions were set up, the advent of press freedom encouraged the publication of weekly journals, and even the public media adopted an unfamiliar libertarian tone. In parallel, the granting of genuine status to parties gave rise, via multiple political forma tions, to official recognition of a multi-party system in 1992. Democracy, therefore, was on the move, even if it was struggling along, its hand somewhat forced by international opinion. Spurred on by the press, demonstrations, poli tical meetings and even strikes (notably by teachers) were to prod the new regime forward. Although initially reluctant, D\u00e9by agreed to hold a Supreme National Conference. This was promised for 1991, but was not held until Janu ary 1993. Broadly speak ing, it failed, undoubt edly from having eyes bigger than its stomach. Too many, often fanciful, subjects were submitted for discussion. Aspirations were too great... and great was the disappoint ment. Add to that a not altogether fair represen tation and grudging pre sidential concessions to a disunited opposition. In brief. President D\u00e9by and his MPS (Movement for Salvation) were confirmed in their posts with increased power, the new democratic institu tions claimed being conspicuous by their ab sence. As for public opinion, initial enthusiasm gave way to disillusionment. Admittedly, a CST (Higher Transitional Council) was set up, to manage the year-long transition period needed to draft a new constitution and to hold presidential and multi-party legislative elections. This year was in fact to last three, as the polls did not take place until June-July 1996 and January-February 1997, respectively. For its part, the constitution was approved by 63% of voters in the March 1996 referendum, marking, more than anything else, rejection of the federalism advocated by those in the south and support for a strong executive. Idriss D\u00e9by won the elections with almost 70% of votes in the second round. Despite opposition accusa tions of misappropriation of funds, his party was subsequently to obtain a majority in the Na tional Assembly, with 63 out of the 125 seats. In all, 70 political formations stood at the poll and 11 were henceforth to share the political scene. Two years later the MPS still leads the govern ment; indeed, its control of legislative matters has increased. By playing the alliances the MPS itself initiated off against one another, the presidential party holds practically all seats in the National Assembly. The voice of dissent, just like the opposition, has simply shrunk away, and there are many who would point to a return to the single-party system. | the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "Fear of the single party As already mentioned, Idriss D\u00e9by found himself in a position of strength after the National Conference, and his hold on power was then legitimated twice at the polls. However, although he could then govern the country alone, the President nevertheless continued to make covert advances to other political forma\u00ad tions, a number of which were acquiescent. One of the first to respond favourably was, curiously enough, the UNDR (National Union for Devel\u00ad opment and Renewal), a 'southern party', led by Saleh Kebzabo, always one of D\u00e9by's most vociferous opponents. He recently explained his position in an interview granted to the weekly publication L'autre Afrique: 'In the second round of the presidential elections, we no longer had any candidates. Being neither first nor second, I had to direct my supporters to vote for someone, and my party decided to vote for D\u00e9by. This is how we came to ally ourselves with D\u00e9by, but not to rally to his cause.' This landmark event took place in June 1996, and Kebzabo was appointed Minister of State in the new government (only to be dismissed a few months later). The URD (Union for Renewal and Democracy), the country's second party after the MPS in terms of votes, did the same. Its leader, Wadel Abder Kamougu\u00e9, the principal loser in the race for the presidency, but since promoted to the post of President of the National Assembly, confided to us: 'We signed an agreement with the MPS with a view to achieving democratic progress and to guaranteeing a state of calm in the country. It is in such a context that the MPS votes helped me take over the presidency of the Assembly, whereas hitherto I had never even been a member of parliament. However, the party continues to work independently and, I must point out, will never agree to a revival of the single\u00adparty system.' Other, smaller parties have also rallied to the presidential party since then. Some have even completely merged with it, as is the case of the \u00cd T H S ^\u00cd \u03b9.\" M fe \u03c6 \u00a1\u03af,\u03b9^\u0386.. Bf \u00abe \u03b9, Bib , t'Ir i? H CSNPD (National Progress Committee for Peace and Democracy), led by Mo\u00efse Kett\u00e9, a former MPS supporter who, dissatisfied with his place in the system, went underground some time ago, after a failed coup d'etat. Sometimes, it is not a party, but a party leader who swaps his opposi tion mantle for the Movement's uniform. This was the case last January of the former pre sident of the RPT (Chad People's Assembly), Dangd\u00e9 Laob\u00e9l\u00e9. His party did not follow his lead, and he has been forced to take 'voluntary leave'. In brief, the government platform is nowadays an impressive one and simply responds to President D\u00e9by's policy wishes, namely of 'con sensual and participatory democracy', in an attempt to take account of Chad's socio-political landscape and to guarantee peace. Ministerial appointments and replacements continue - in his eight years in power, Idriss D\u00e9by has had 166 ministers (and five prime ministers), i.e. 24 different governments with an average of three reshuffles per year! His critics see this as no more than a tactic whereby he can assume total power. They are also concerned at what they consider the dangerous game played by parties who accept his invitation to join his movement. 'On certain issues of national interest, the participating opposition ought to demonstrate its difference of opinion by taking up certain positions. Paradoxically, what we are witnessing is excess involvement', laments Gilbert Maoun- donodji, editor-in-chief of Tchad et Culture, a monthly analytical and general news review. A mere alliance for the good of the country or undeclared submission, safeguarded political commitment or an empty shell? In any case, the opposition's voice is clearly becoming more difficult to hear, a fact which does not facilitate the democratic process. Others would claim that the 'MPS-dominated' Assembly is no more than the government's resonance chamber. The fol lowing aphorism is often put forward as an explanation: A mouth filled with food cannot talk. 'Most of the parties allow themselves to be seduced by money', explains Mrs Koumbo Singa Gali, director of L'Observateur, an independent weekly, 'because Chad is a poor country and the parties are obliged to obtain money where it exists, that is to say at the very centre of power. So they team up with D\u00e9by in order to become district chief, councillor, general or whatever.' Shared guilt? Although this view is shared by a number of commentators, the sharp tone undoubtedly needs to be softened. The opposition's alleged predilection for material comfort and power is encouraged by a regime which is willing to promote its involvement. The case of Ngarlejy Yorongar is a good illustration: a member of parliament from Logone Oriental (south), a committed federalist. President of the FAR (Action for the Republic Federation), and a major figure, his parliamentary immunity was withdrawn in May 1998 and he was put on trial for having made defamatory remarks against the Head of State and the president of the Assembly.

Events took a dramatic turn last February, when Yorongar was freed, par\u00ad doned by President D\u00e9by. When we met him two days after his release from prison, he told us that he was 'on probation', adding: Officially, I've been released on humanitarian grounds, which means absolutely nothing! Nevertheless, prison is the best place from which to observe the genuine nature of a regime. After my stay, I feel I am in a position to confirm that the concept of the rule of law is totally alien to our government! That prison is an old people's home and justice is only an illusion.' Significantly, also, the opposition has increas\u00ad ingly less scope to make itself heard. Its access to the public media is derisory, automatic (self\u00ad) censorship being blithely put into operation. The organisation of a meeting or of a demon\u00ad stration has also become extremely difficult, as confirmed by Gilbert Maoundonodji: 'The oppo\u00ad sition has never had genuine status, with means of action, freedom to move and intimidation\u00ad free access to the public media. The current system in this country involves, first and fore\u00ad most, a power struggle where one either sides with the strongest, disappears or takes up arms.' Some have preferred to opt for the latter solution. The south and, in particular, the Moundou region has always been a hotbed of dissent and only last year, rebellion flared up yet again when Laokein Barde and his FARF\u00adVA (Front of Alliances for a Federal Republic\u00adVictims of Aggression) went underground. Once more, the rebellion ended in bloody repression. Nowadays, it is the Tibesti region which is overheating, since a former D\u00e9by minister, Youssef Togo'imi, | decided to take up arms. Although | the raison d'\u00eatre for the Barde \u00ad rebellion was in the north/south conflict, Togoi'mi's 'outburst' is thought to be no more than a matter of honour held up to ridicule. Whatever it is, rumour has it that there have been dozens of deaths, whole villages razed to the ground, and a national army in difficulty in the face of the rebels' advance. The government, meanwhile, has long hidden be\u00ad hind an anxious silence, official communiqu\u00e9s finally confirming the facts, but minimising them to excess: only 20 retired soldiers are said to have supported the rebellion and the situa\u00ad tion was rapidly brought under control. Soldiers of the Chad army present in the area are said to be there only to check the borders. Those who came back with injuries are said to have been the victims of a landmine explosion which blew up a truck. So, who is to be believed? 'These are indeed only rumours', a diplomat in N'Djamena told us. 'But, here, rumours are rarely incorrect and as soon as a rebellion begins in Chad, it rapidly snowballs.' A similar cause for concern is the situation of civil society which, it should be remembered, the Courier n e 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 demonstrated genuine dynamism when the democratic process first took off. Still in its infancy, it is feeling its way, but it is heavy going. It would appear that it shares the same problems as the opposition. Some of its leaders have also opted to join up with the powers that be, at the same time discrediting civil society as a whole in the eyes of public opinion (the former president of the Human Rights League, for example, became a minister, whereas the assistant general secretary of the Chad Trades\u00ad Union Association is now director of commu\u00ad nication). The regime is also attempting to regain its hold over civil society and, if appro\u00ad priate, to muzzle it. Public demonstrations are problematical these days, human rights associa\u00ad tions, suspended even temporarily, often have to take risks, and political discussion takes place behind closed doors. Given the context, is the press the last bastion of free speech in the country, as it would like to have us believe? The press \u00ad the last bastion of free speech? An independent press, naturally. Largely in the pay of the regime, national television is highly controlled and censored. The same applies to radio broadcasting, which has the added problem of outmoded equip\u00ad ment. Since the beginning of the 1990s, when the outlook was fairly favourable, journalists overall have had their freedom eroded on a daily basis, particularly in the wake of the elections. As for Progr\u00e8s, a former weekly publication which is now a daily, it often limits itself to publishing government communi\u00ad qu\u00e9s. The 'independent' press, however, has never agreed to lay down its pen, anxious to keep its hands free. What it writes only rarely has government approval; it is no more than a euphemism, sometimes inordinately so. If a journal such as Tchad et Culture relies on presenting shades of meaning, others, on the contrary, are not afraid to adopt a vociferous stance. Acerbic, irreverent, more often than not merely pamphlets, N'Djamena Hebdo, Le Temps and L'Observateur are genuine cancers eating away at the regime \u00ad or, at least, they should be. And there lies the paradox: despite laying into the regime tooth and nail, this section of the press enjoys a freedom of expression which is hard to countenance in Chad's context. N\u00e9h\u00e9mie B\u00e9noudjita, director of Le Temps, nevertheless plays down such enthusiasm: 'press freedom, which is relative, makes things difficult for us. We're caught in a trap because we've become the democratic guarantors of a regime which is still autocratic and under which other forms of expression are extremely limited. We are no more than a foil for sponsors.' Maybe. The wind has changed direction, and various types of 'pressure' are applied from time to time \u00ad equipment destroyed here, strong\u00adarm ",
        "tactics against journalists there (some have been killed). The powers\u00adthat\u00adbe in fact appear to have decided on a change of plan: since 1998, the three weeklies have been living under a suspended sentence. Some for defamation, others for having wanted to destabilise the country (for having set a cat amongst the pigeons by raising the issue of Chad's troops being sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo). Nor does their future look particularly bright, since the Communication Minister re\u00ad cently announced that he would have no hesitation in bringing in harsher measures. 'The threat is indeed a serious one', the director of N'Djamena Hebdo told us. 'We are aware that, next time, it will be prison with no possibility of remission. But we remain deter\u00ad mined \u00ad if there are things worth saying, we will say them.' An inescapable wrestling match? Probably. 'We're obliged to respond head\u00adon. Chad's press has its back against the wall and has no other choice', the director of Le Temps lamented, adding that 'the regime accuses us of wanting to destabilise Chad in the eyes of its partners whereas we are merely fulfilling our duty as purveyors of information.' Ongoing insecurity Could this harsher approach to the press be symptomatic of a parallel hardening of the regime's approach overall? Certainly, some would agree with this view, and it would be a pity. Certain major issues underlying the coun\u00ad try's instability remain unresolved, for example the ongoing climate of insecurity \u00ad not only socio\u00adeconomic insecurity (Chad is still one of the world's poorest countries and poverty is a daily reality for a considerable percentage of the population), but also insecurity full stop. Human rights violations have never been com\u00ad pletely eradicated from Chad. The formula is a familiar one: 30 years of civil war cannot merely be swept aside. This is all the more true when someone whom the people refer to as a 'politico\u00admilitary man' is replaced by another of the same ilk. In 1990, the reign of terror initiated by Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 admittedly came to an end, but this did not mean that Chad had seen its last bloodbath. As a native of Ouedda'i (he is a zaghaoua from Biltine), geographically in the east of the country, Idriss D\u00e9by is primarily, for many p e o p le ( n a m e ly southerners) some\u00ad one from the north. In other words, de\u00ad spite the immediate appointment of a southerner as prime minister, to maintain the geopolitical bal\u00ad ance, his coming to power was not a source of joy for everyone in Chad. So the eternal fratricidal conflict goes on. Dissidence, then rebellion, then repression \u00ad particularly in the two Logones in 1982 and 1983. The scene is further sullied by murders such as that of Joseph B\u00e9hidi, a member of Chad's Human Rights League. According to Nadji Laouhingane, president of the Moundou league, large\u00adscale violations of human rights are still perpetrated in Chad. 'There are still many instances of extrajudicial executions, of people being tortured or held in police custody, summary violations of rights, humiliations and even instances of the rape of women and also young girls. The government, and therefore its executive arm, namely the army, the police and the gendarmerie, exerts arbitrary force over populations with no invol\u00ad vement in politics. Usually, these are merely acts of vengeance against age\u00adold dissent.' Ob\u00ad viously, the bloody events in the south in 1997 merit a mention. 'There has been something of a lull over the past few months. Violations are now perpetrated principally at detention centres and police stations. However, the destruction of roads, racketeering and the fleecing of peasant farmers and stock breeders are widespread. So is the impunity which appears to be enjoyed by those who perpetrate such acts.' Admittedly, the size of its military forces is a thorn in Chad's side. The army is made up of two principal units: the nomadic National Guard, of which Idriss D\u00e9by's uncle is the director, and the Rapid Intervention Forces, a type of army within the army consisting of members of his clan. The caste system is respected and feared, but this does not guaran\u00ad tee any greater discipline than in other corps \u00ad countless soldiers are often at a loose end, and the reintegration programme takes too long to find them new jobs. All these factors taken together mean that 'Chad may explode at any time'. Violence is indeed latent, and it may weaken a democratic process which, in spite of everything, is making progress, even if this is sometimes in the wrong direction. Municipal elections are on the cards \u00ad perhaps the results will put an end to what not only Chad's citizens but also for\u00ad eigners view as the prevailing climate: resignation.

        "A glowing future for the economy? The acrid smell of petroleum is becoming activity. Stockbreeding and cotton are the The acrid smell of petroleum is becoming increasingly noticeable in Chad in the final days of the twentieth century. Although the first well is still no more than a sketch on a drawing board, black gold is already being heralded as the philosophers' stone. It is futile to point out that years of war have left marks to please even the most gloomy statisticians, but although most of these figures still apply, Chad's econo\u00ad my is definitely, from certain aspects, on the up. As Africa's most land-locked country, Chad is undoubtedly a Sahelian nation - although with a degree of variation. Despite having a good half of its territory buried under desert sand and pebbles, fields of sorghum alongside thorn-bush scrub and date palms, with nomads and trans humants watering their livestock, are a daily sight. As these stockmen make their way down to less hostile lands in the south, they inevitably encounter cotton growers and rest in the shade of mango and other trees. National produce also includes gum arabic, a few vegetables (toma toes, spinach, etc.), tubers, the odd fruit, and groundnuts, but all in small quantities. Goats and sheep gambol about everywhere all the time. Manufacturing is underdeveloped, is con centrated exclusively in the towns and serves principally the domestic market. Similarly, the private sector is extremely restricted, the coun try's principal employer still being the state. Naturally, a considerable proportion of the population, particularly women, make a living from the unofficial economy. Agriculture is still overwhelmingly dominant, accounting for 80% of the country's economic activity. Stockbreeding and cotton are the mother's milk of the state. Close on three million of Chad's citizens, i.e. half the total population, make a living out of cotton, for example. All cotton growers sell their produce to the same purchaser, the state-owned Co- tontchad, which also provides them with their inputs. Everything has a price fixed by presiden tial decree and announced on the radio. After ginning, produce is subdivided into fibre cotton (90%), which is exported to textile mills, and seed cotton (10%), which is used for local production of soap and oil. Cotontchad's mono poly on this sector is nevertheless at risk of being broken up at any time: private operators are looking in its direction, very much against the wishes of the company's director, Ibrahim Malloum: 'I'm completely against privatisation of such a strategic sector as cotton, which is functioning perfectly well. Furthermore, we have a moral obligation to our peasant farmers, given that we buy all that they produce. What will become of them if the sector is divided up?' Neither one thing nor the other Privatisation is the fruit of the three-year Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) imple mented in 1995 together with the Bretton Woods institutions and with a budget of CFAF 33 billion, this entire sum having been hit by the devaluation of the CFA franc. The programme, which is supposed to promote the emergence of a private sector, has the following macro- economic objectives: a real growth rate in excess of 5% for the period from 1996 to 1999, average inflation brought down to 3.5% by 1999, and a budget deficit which may not exceed 12% of the GDP. A number of reforms are also on the agenda, such as the liberalisation of the econ omy, control of the wage bill and expansion of the tax base. Although the implementation of the SAP has led to further payments from other donors, the principal advantage it has brought with it is undoubtedly a trend towards ortho doxy in terms of economic policy which hitherto was often haphazard. The end of the three years of structural adjust ment is now drawing nigh (the programme was delayed slightly), and the initial results could be summed up by 'control and stability'. Certain figures are indeed promising, although they ought to be viewed with caution. Growth, which at the end of 1997 was close on 7%, is, for example, due essentially to an unprece dented cotton harvest: the 103,000 tonnes broke all previous records. The current cotton season, however, which ends in May, looks less profitable (undoubtedly 20% down on the previous year). These figures can be put down to scarce rainfall. Furthermore, the fall in fibre- cotton prices is generating a degree of anxiety. Another example is public finances: although they are demonstrating a certain level of recovery, a study carried out by the BEAC (Bank of Central African States) nevertheless mentions, in late 1998, a shortfall in income. There is no room for complacency, however. Inflation has the Courier n\u00b0 - may-june 1999 ",
        "been brought back down to around 3% but the general consumer prices index has recorded a considerable rise during the past year, particu\u00ad larly as regards food products. The scaling\u00addown of state involvement in in\u00ad dustry, although it is continuing and has already marked up a number of successes, remains a sensitive issue. This is particularly noticeable in the more strategic enterprises such as Sonasut (Chad's national sugar company) and the STEE (Chad Water and Electricity Company). With their situation still shaky, early 1999 does not currently appear to be a good time to find a private investor. It is the STEE that is principally in the private sector's sights. Chad's electricity is currently reputed to be the most expensive in the world, perhaps also the rarest! Apart from serious financial problems and restricted produc\u00ad tion capacity, its fuel supply has been in deficit for almost one year. Power cuts can occur at any time, with the result that many SMEs and non\u00ad industrial workers are forced to shut up shop. Certain larger enterprises have also had to do the same. The current economic situation therefore re\u00ad mains fragile and consolidation is the order of the day. This was to have been promoted by the almost $1 billion in funds released in the wake of the fourth round table meeting of Chad's partners held in Geneva last October. According to Ali Hassan, Minister for the Plan and national authorising officer under the Lom\u00e9 Convention, the areas of rural development, health, educa\u00ad tion and infrastructures were also given priority status, in agreement with the government. Infrastructures: without a doubt, their glaring absence is a veritable millstone around the neck of development. The case of transport is parti\u00ad cularly pertinent in this respect \u00ad in a territory three times the size of France, there are only 300 kilometres of asphalted roads. Apart from this, there is sand and, for the more fortunate, laterite. A very limited number of tracks are suitable for motor vehicles throughout the year, others being out of commission during the winter months. Rural development, health, education: is it worth mentioning figures? The human develop\u00ad ment index (which takes into account various factors, such as life expectancy, percentage of children attending school, etc.) should suffice: 0.313, which puts Chad in 163rd place out of 175 countries. Growth rates are of little concern to people whose more immediate aspirations go no further than gaining access to drinking water, alleviating famine and learning how to read and write. As an economist we met in N'Djamena was at pains to inform us: 'There are two sides to the situation in Chad \u00ad firstly, the Bretton Woods institutions, with their structural results and their quantity, and then that of everyone else, those who prefer to speak of quality. Both are equally valid, it just depends on your point of view'. Whatever the case may be, in the current social and economic context, it is easy to see how oil is being welcomed as the solution to Chad's endemic underdevelopment. Petroleum exploi\u00ad tation ought to mean the end of the country's paralysing energy crisis, a portion of its revenue would be reinvested in priority social sectors, employment would be created, roads and bridges would be built \u00ad what more besides? But hold on! The first barrelful is not even out of the ground. There is black gold, make no mistake, but as yet there is no green light from the World Bank for work to start. Black is beautiful? When viewed in any terms other than those of its potential, Chad is a poor country \u00ad the words of Abdelwahab Ch\u00e9rif, joint national authoris\u00ad ing officer for the EDF. Petroleum is therefore significant. Discovered in 1974, its commercial viability was established only in 1996, the year when a first accord was signed between the governments of Chad and Cameroon. This accord, which was subsequently ratified, pro\u00ad vides for the construction and maintenance of a pipeline which will enable the produce from future deposits in the Doba basin, in Southern Chad, to be discharged at Kribi, on the Camer\u00ad oonian coast. The works will be financed and undertaken almost entirely by a consortium made up of Esso (40% and project operator). Shell (40%) and Elf (20%). The remainder will be undertaken by the two governments, which will receive financial support from the World Bank. It was the consortium itself which wanted to involve that financial institution. Jean\u00adPierre Petit, director\u00adgeneral of Esso for Chad, explains why: 'We wanted such a partnership so that the Bank could say that the best possible conditions had been set up, either in terms of the installation plan, taking all the necessary pre\u00ad cautions to avoid an ecological disaster, or so that we could not be criticised for having thrown away an unexpected gift from which not all the country benefited'. Guarantees and moral caution \u00ad clearly exploita\u00ad tion of the Doba petroleum will have conse\u00ad the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 \u0392 ",
        "quences for the people, their environment and their living conditions. A study has been carried out by the consortium and the government of Chad to ascertain the impact of the works on the environment, how the latter may be mana ged, the compensation payments and the relo cations of populations that will be necessary. Although, at the time of going to press, the World Bank had not yet approved this study in its entirety (certain details proved problematic), we can confirm that Mr Petit described himself as confident when we met him, particularly regarding the socio-economic consequences for the population: 'We have canvassed all the interested parties and have come to an agree ment as to rates of compensation. Payment in cash has already been made and we are now commencing payment in kind, as some families preferred to receive their compensation in the form of a plough, livestock, etc. Collective compensation remains to be paid. We therefore have no problem with the local population; in fact, quite the contrary'. Regarding population relocation, Esso's director states that even the most pessimistic of estimates involve fewer than 60 families. As might have been expected, the tone of the many development NGOs and human rights defence associations, both national and interna tional, is quite different. In the last few months, they have been mobilising their resources. In their opinion, the negative impact on fauna, flora, water courses and crops must be seriously considered, as must the risks of air and soil pollution. Furthermore, many of them make repeated reference to violations of human rights vis-\u00e0-vis the populations concerned. It is inter esting to note that local organisations are often slightly more qualified in their reaction than their colleagues in the northern hemisphere. In many cases, they point principally to a marked lack of information and awareness promotion. The same applies within many traditional chief taincies, who are demanding that, come what may, ways and customs must be respected. To say that the proposed exploitation of petro leum is giving rise to debate is an understate ment. Discussion is not limited to environmental issues - without a doubt, petroleum is also a political hot potato. Critics of Chad's govern ment are taking aim, with oil-revenue manage ment in the line of fire. Will everything take place completely transparently? Will the popu lation receive a fair return? Will revenue genuinely be ploughed back into health and education? All such questions generate suspi cion, even denials, not only in opposition mouths and in the independent press, but also on the part of a number of observers outside Chad's political scene. It must be agreed that current management of national resources is not entirely above reproach, with nepotism, patron age and doubtful payments all being part of daily life. It is to counter such practices that MPs voted in favour of a law on equitable manage ment of petroleum revenue. According to the consortium's current estimates, the 300 wells to be drilled in the Doba basin will make it possible to extract over 200,000 barrels of high-grade petroleum per day. Apart from the vast majority of profits which will, in any case, go to the three oil companies, these same estimates indicate a total direct benefit of the order of $5 billion for Chad, plus indirect income of approximately $3.5 billion. A portion of these funds will be managed by the BEAC. '55% of revenue will be held on account for 20 or 30 years, to benefit the region. A further 10% will also be set aside for future generations. The remainder is intended for development and for poverty alleviation', the Bank's director, Maha- mad Ben Barka, confirmed to us. How much is the crossing? Bear in mind that all this is currently only on paper, since N'Djamena is awaiting the green light from Washington. Moreover, it will take a good three years to build the oil pipeline and to sink the wells. Meanwhile, the price for crossing the Chari, the river on which the capital stands, remains unchanged. This trip by dugout canoe costs CFAF 25. M T.G. B the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "'There is no North\u00adSouth problem in Chad!' An interview with Prime Minister Nassour Oua\u00efdo Originally from the Mayo\u00adK\u00e9bbi area in southern Chad and a member of the governing party (MPS), Mr Nassour Oua\u00efdou has held this post since 16 May 1997. Before that he was general secretary of the Office of the President. First of all, we asked him to give us his assessment of the work accomplished by the government he has led for two years. I usually maintain that it's a difficult thing to talk about oneself \u00ad it's up to others to analyse my g o v e r n m e n t 's ' achievements in the context of the provisions contained in our constitution. On 4 June 1997, the National Assembly adopted our policy programme by a very large majority. This programme is based principally on the policies of consolidating the democratic process, setting up the institutions outlined in our constitution, decentralising power, reinforcing the multi\u00ad party system, etc. So, how do you view democratic progress? I believe it's a unique opportunity, not only for the political class but also for all my compatriots to make a break, once and for all, with all the violence Chad has experienced, and to turn resolutely towards peace. Yet exercising democ\u00ad racy is no easy task. Although a number of political parties existed in Chad prior to inde\u00ad pendence, 1962 saw the rise of the single\u00adparty system which lasted until the 1975 coup d'\u00e9tat and the military regime which ensued. Funda\u00ad mental freedoms were suspended. Then, in 1979, there was civil war and a series of political/military regimes. The single party re\u00ad gained power in 1982 and it was not until 1990 that a democratic process was set up. There are currently over 60 recognised political parties, each responsible for its own organisation and for generating political debate. Nowadays, Chad is on the right road, although this democracy needs to be bolstered around the principal theme of consolidation of national unity and a shared desire to move the country up the development ladder. This is not what you would call a union, in the true sense of the word, but the setting\u00adup of a more widely based executive committee, so that ideas and the like are better expressed. As you know, there was a refer\u00ad endum and the opposition par\u00ad ties fought against it (the con\u00ad stitution was adopted by 69% of the vote). Then we held the presidential elections, where there were 15 candidates, two of whom dropped out in the second round. Then there were the legislative elections, where more than 3000 candidates stood for 125 seats. Next there will be municipal elections \u00ad then you will see just how active our political system is! One of the principal opposition figures, Yorongar Ngarlejy M.P., was last June sentenced to three years' imprisonment, yet a few days ago he was released at President D\u00e9by's insistence. Is this a way of demonstrating that the President has power of life and death over him? The Yorongar problem has been the subject of interminable discussion. His arrest was described as a political act. Let's look at the facts: Mr Yorongar is a citizen and every citizen has both rights and duties. During a press conference, he accused the President of the National Assembly of having received backhanders from a company which belonged to an oil consortium \u00ad sums of CFAF 1.5 billion were mentioned. The President of the Assembly, himself a citizen, launched a complaint. As regards his release, the President has the right to grant a pardon under the terms of the constitution. Mr Yorongar was therefore par\u00ad doned, making this no more than a correct sequence of events. If people wish to interpret it another way, then they, too, have the right to do so. One interpretation might be that it was only on account of pressure from donors that Mr Yorongar was released, amid protests about basic respect for human rights. Some would say that Chad looks set to return to the single\u00adparty system, given that there are fewer and fewer members of the opposition. In fact, a number of so\u00adcalled parties and leading figures have recently joined the ranks of the President's supporters. My reply is quite simple: everyone is free to set up a political party, but a party is like a business. You have to be able to manage its internal dynamics. This does not explain the existence of alliances, but as soon as you realise that you are all pursuing the same goal, you form an alliance. have no comment on that. Let's move on to another topic which is currently in the headlines: what exactly is going on in the Tibesti region ? Rumour has it that there has been a well\u00adsupported rebellion and dozens of deaths. The government, however, is being particularly reticent and suggesting that a vehicle was blown up by a There is indeed a rebellion, led by a former minister. On this subject, perhaps you would like the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 \u0392 ",
        "to refer to the communiqu\u00e9 issued by the Defence Minister. The situation is now stable again \u00ad there is no 'battle' going on in the Tibesti area. We are committed to our policy of national reconciliation, but sometimes that means we find ourselves on the very margins of peace. surplus to export. Oil will therefore be only a supplementary resource enabling us to consoli\u00ad date our development. As far as the use of oil revenue is concerned, we have chosen four key sectors, as I have already mentioned: education, health, infrastructures and rural development. Let's turn now to the economy. At last October's round table conference in Geneva, what were the principal conclusions ? Chad has been subject to a structural adjustment programme for the last three years, since 1 July 1995. In September 1997, the programme was suspended for a period of four months, then re\u00ad started and we are now coming to the end of our third year. The round table conference paved the way for an interim programme, also covering three years, to prepare a long\u00adterm development programme. This is why the round table conference called together all our bilateral and multilateral partners. The sectors to which we are giving priority attention are those of education, health, rural development and infra\u00ad structure. After the round table conference, we set up a high\u00adranking monitoring committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, and also a technical committee and subcommittees. One of the reforms concerns the privatisation of State enterprises, including the STEE (State Water and Electricity Authority) and the SONASUT (Chad National Sugar Board). Could you tell us something about this? We have already privatised a number of public enterprises, and now large companies, such as the SONASUT, remain to be converted. In the case of the STEE, the invitation to tender will be published in the next few days. Our programme of scaling down State involvement is therefore going ahead as planned, despite the fact that there were a number of problems and misun\u00ad derstandings in certain sectors. Nevertheless, we are determined to pursue this policy to enable the private sector to take over. Is this the situation of CotonTchad? Needless to say, privatisation of that company will have certain repercussions \u00ad be they good or bad \u00ad on a very large section of the population which depends on cotton for a living. Is a dismantling of the sector on the cards? You are right in thinking that the government's prime concern is that Chad's interests should be safeguarded. We don't privatise State enter\u00ad prises just for the sheer pleasure of it! We do whatever is in Chad's interests. Chad's economic future seems increasingly to depend on oil. Of course, any revenue from this will have to be distributed equitably and wisely. Oil is only one source of wealth among many. Chad is primarily an agricultural and pastoral country \u00ad we have approximately 39 million hectares of land that can be cultivated. Also, we have resources of water and one of Africa's largest national livestock herds. Everything we do is to enable us to survive. Even if we could cultivate only 30% of our land, we would still enjoy food security and would even have a At the moment, however, the petroleum issue is still awaiting the go\u00adahead from the World Bank, principally because of a study into the environmental and socio\u00adeconomic consequences of developing this resource. The World Bank is a partner; one talks to one's partners. Frequently, it is possible to arrive at solutions. Naturally, we are concerned about our own environment, particularly since the major part of our territory consists of desert. As you can imagine, we don't wish to create further environmental problems. Quite the opposite. In order to preserve nature, we have discussed the risks, conducted an environmental impact study and implemented an environment\u00admanagement plan. All these ideas need to be refined in order to allow petroleum exploitation. At any rate, everything appears to be going well. Another major reform currently on the agenda is the reduction in and reintegration of the nation's surplus military personnel. In 1993 and 1994, our army was indeed over\u00ad staffed, and we received help in demobilising a great many soldiers under our cooperation arrangement with France. Our aim is to bring troop numbers down to 25,000. A structure has been set up for this purpose and is doing its job. We believe that this reform is on the right lines. The reintegration programme has now started, with World Bank financing, although, at the moment, it's a pilot programme which may be expanded at a later date. Finally, Prime Minister, in your view, is the North\u00ad South conflict myth or reality? It is no more than a stereotype. People have always made us into opponents \u00ad yet there is north, south, east and west in any country. When you talk to the people in these regions, such differences are not remotely apparent. On the contrary, there are many mixed marriages. Chad is a multi\u00adethnic country, something we regard as an asset. In terms of religious denomi\u00ad nation, there are the two major revealed religions, whose members live together very harmoniously. You will find people from the north living in the south, just as you will find people from the south living in the north, even if they are on State duty. The main obstacle to this type of mixing is purely and simply that the country's road system is not up to the task. If we were able to travel all over Chad, this intermix\u00ad ing would be even more marked. When we are able to build roads all over the country, you will be able to see that this North\u00adSouth problem no longer exists. In any case, Chad has no North\u00ad South problem: it exists only in the subconscious of those who would like there to be one.

        "Interview w i th Opposition member Mr Jean\u00adBawoyeu Alingu\u00e9, 'The r e g i me does n ot have a d e m o c r a t ic c u l t u r e' A former Prime Minister and also President of the National Assembly before the arrival of the MPS (Movement for Salvation) in 1990, Jean\u00ad Bawoyeu Alingu\u00e9 is President of the UDR (Union for Democracy and the Republic), one of the few genuine opposition parties in Chad. These days, he is an M.P. in the National Assembly. To begin with, we asked him for his assessment of the democratic process. First and foremost, it is im\u00ad portant to point out that democracy arrived amid a great fanfare and was received with great jubilation on all sides. Also, the process of setting up democratic institutions has begun. There was a referendum, a presidential election and then legislative elections, all of which enabled the democratic process to get under way. The current issue is knowing how to sustain this process in a country like ours, by which I mean a state which has been through thirty years of civil war and where free speech has always been a rare luxury. Unfortunately, it has come to our notice that the government has recently made a number of departures from its blueprint for democracy in Chad. It has brought in several regulations which are completely in conflict with respect for human rights... instances of injustice, intimi\u00ad dation of the private press, etc. Moreover, parliament appears to be unable genuinely to perform its institutional role regarding matters of public interest. I am referring here to the oral or written questions addressed to the govern\u00ad ment but which are not answered. Also, the public media have obstacles put in their way, which prevents free expression of opinion. All these instances hold back the democratic process we should be consolidating. So, as a member of the Opposition, you are increasingly isolated? Admittedly, we are going through a difficult period. If an opposition is unable to establish itself in a country, there can be no democracy. Moreover, the fact that the elections took place in such disgraceful circumstances \u00ad there was a great deal of vote\u00adrigging \u00ad has caused a number of activists and certain parties to lose faith. They believed that events would move forward under their own momentum. I, myself, have always said that democracy needs time, and that political activists cannot afford to rest. Another problem stems from the fact that the government is attempting to force the opposi\u00ad tion parties to throw their lot in with the MPS. Given the country's economic and social situa\u00ad tion, and taking into account the opposition parties' difficult financial circumstances, it's extremely easy to make an Opposition leader the offer of a post as a director or adviser etc. More serious, on the other hand, is the fact that the President of the Republic did nothing to promote the cause of democracy in a state\u00ad ment he issued slightly less than a year ago. Within the context of Colonel Gaddafi's visit to Chad, President D\u00e9by clearly stated that off\u00ad the\u00adpeg democracy, by which he meant democ\u00ad racy imported from the West, was not right for this country. In a country such as Chad, where the socio\u00ad economic situation is so fragile, where democ\u00ad racy is in its infancy and where political activists still have a low profile, such things combine to hold back the democratic process. As for the Opposition, we see our role as maintaining a presence in the Assembly and doing our work as members of that Opposition. If that were not our working principle, Chad's political system would immediately revert to that of the single party. Do you therefore share the opinion of the private press which maintains that there is a real danger of the single party re\u00ademerging? Absolutely! But we will be carrying on our activities as an opposition party. Mr Yorongar, another spearhead of the Opposition, was released from prison the day before yesterday, despite having been sentenced to a full three\u00adyear term. How do you explain his release? The fact that his release was sudden amply supports the view I have held since the time he was arrested, that Mr Yorongar's imprisonment was purely political. Of course, a great deal of pressure was brought to bear for his release, both internationally and nationally, but by pardoning Yorongar, the Head of State is above all demonstrating the fact that he considers himself to be above the general fray, in other words that he has the power of life or death over all Chad's citizens. What else are we supposed to think if a president prosecutes an M.P. and then pardons him later on? As part and parcel of the pardon, Mr Yorongar has lost his seat, which raises many other issues. How do you read the government's silence regarding the Tibesti situation or the despatch of troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo? \u0392 the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "It merely illustrates the administration's lack of a democratic philosophy, as it obviously feels it has no need to inform the public. I, myself, raised the issue of Chad's troops being sent to the DRC at the most recent session of the National Assembly: our soldiers have been mobilised without backing from the Assembly, and I wanted the government to offer an explanation to its people. An order was imme diately issued for the session to be held in camera, which was unconstitutional in this specific case! What it amounts to is a total refusal to inform public opinion. Furthermore, journalists from L'Observateur who also raised the issue were condemned! Yes, you have mentioned several times that the freedom granted the private press was nothing but a foil for international public opinion. And so it is. The government uses the private press as an alibi for democracy. However, N'Djamena Hebdo is living under a suspended sentence. So is L'Observateur. Le Temps, also, is always being prosecuted. The regime allows journalists to have their say to make donors believe that there is real press freedom in Chad, whereas that is not the case. How can one speak of press freedom when editors are constantly being threatened? In your opinion, what should Chad's priorities be? As always, genuine consolidation of the demo cratic process. It's like a new-born child: you have to teach him about life gradually, and watch him as he grows day by day. A second priority would be a consistent ap proach to economic and social development to allow fair distribution amongst the people of The democratic process is like a child...' the resources we receive from the international community and the resources we generate ourselves. This would help Chad's citizens come to the gradual realisation that their experience of the last thirty years - the single party, violence, misery, etc. - is well and truly a thing of the past. Do you believe in development based on petroleum ? I believe in petroleum, because it is a fact, and therefore a plus, but it is certainly not a panacea. Nevertheless, income from petroleum must be distributed equitably to all Chad's communities and peoples. I have my doubts, however, that the current government is capable of managing petroleum revenue fairly. The eight years during which the MPS regime has been in power have taught us to believe the opposite, not only regarding flows of funds from donors but also income from the cotton sector or stock-rearing. The resources of CotonTchad and Sonasut have been completely squandered! The funds taken from their coffers did not end up in the economic or social sphere, I might add, and the same thing will happen again when we start to generate petroleum revenue. Do you believe in a united Chad? I do, indeed, because Chad's citizens have a tradition of communal living. What divides communities, however, is government policy, which thwarts attempts at establishing mutual understanding. State structures need to be adapted to suit Chad's multi-ethnic reality, and the sooner this problem can be solved the better. The so-called North-South conflict is exacerbated and accentuated by all the injustices the country has known for more years than I care to remember. The MPS's policy further aggravates this conflict. Let me give you an example: of all the prefects, sub-prefects and directors-general who have been appointed, how many are competent managers? Far too many were given their job simply because they belong to one clan or another. The government is a past master at such abuse of the system. Nevertheless, this conflict should not be brought back to two well-defined entities: there are indeed communities in the North which also feel they have been done down. Do you support the setting-up of a federal state ? My party voted for decentralisation. Does this mean that the final structure will be a federa tion? I've actually no idea, but for the time being I would not advocate it and I support power being granted to the regions. That would suffice for a Chad made up of different com munities and different ethnic groups. Each of these would be able to manage its own affairs as it saw fit. Chad's citizens favour such a solution and we will be campaigning for this at future sessions of the National Assembly. MM Interview by T.G. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 fl ",
        "A glance at t he North-South conflict The North-South conflict - myth or reality? This was the title of a collection produced by the Al Mouna Centre in 1996. In the introduction, it is stated that for some, there is no North-South conflict in Chad - the situation is simply the fruit of the imagination of certain discomfited politicians and intellectuals. It goes on to say that, for others, the North-South issue has played a major part in Chad's political evolu\u00ad tion. So, who is right? The book's ten or so chapters do not really answer the question. What they offer is, rather, guidance for reflec\u00ad tion, clarification of the various aspects of the country's history, and brief analyses of the origin and evolution of human, political and economic relationships. The impression is that the various Chadian intellectuals - inevitably from either the North or the South, perhaps despite themselves - who have taken up their pen must have had some personal involvement, sometimes objectively, sometimes less so. The reader is left to judge for himself. The fact remains, however, that this issue is a highly sensitive one in Chad, imbued with taboos which have proved difficult to shake off. So many things appear to be linked to it: from the nature of the state to the causes of the civil war; from disputes between farmers and stock\u00ad breeders to the geographical division of the towns and cities; from the way in which administrative appointments are made to the way in which history is interpreted. The situa\u00ad tion is further exacerbated by the fact that two essential elements overlay this 'North-South dialectic', namely language and religion. This, then, is the current state of affairs. Let us begin at the beginning. Are the North and the South fundamentally different? It should be stated, first of all, that this North- South distinction does not correspond to a geographical division of the territory into two equal parts. It is the Shari, a river rising in the Central African Republic, and flowing into Lake Chad, which separates the two 'halves', obli quely along the Sarh-N'Djamena line. Thus, at first sight, the South, known as the 'Sudanese' region, represents barely one-tenth of Chad's total area. However, South and North have substantially the same number of inhabitants. Another fact: are the North and the South composed of two clearly distinct blocs, namely an Arabic-speaking, Islamic North composed essentially of stockbreeders and a South where farmers, either Christian or animist, have French as their common language? One is tempted to reply both 'yes' and 'no', too complete a dichotomy obviously being erroneous. Admit tedly, for the vast majority of the population in the North, the predominant economic activity is stockbreeding and, in the case of the South, agriculture. It is also a fact that the religious distinction is generally true and that different languages are in use. However, this does not rule out the existence of oases in the extreme North whose occupants are not nomadic and cultivate the land (gardening, date palms), or the fact that certain animist rites survive in some Islamic communities and that the North does indeed have a Christian minority. On the other hand, it would be totally false to claim that North and South constitute two blocs living in harmony, quite simply because the country contains some 100 ethnic groups with different vernacular languages and different social and cultural structures. Similarly, in a country where it is the extended family and, in a wider sense, the tribe and the clan which constitutes society's central element, do people really feel a deep- rooted attachment to a 'North' or to a 'South'? Finally, any impression of harmony is illusory because North and South are aware of their own internal divisions. Moreover, it suffices to review current events, if in need of further persuasion: the rebellion in the Tibesti region is led by Youssef Togo\u00efmi, who is from the North, as is D\u00e9by. This is not an isolated example. What are the roots of the conflict? Here, we come to a second question which, in itself, generates considerable discussion: if con flict exists, whence does it arise? Some hold the colonisers primarily responsible, while others maintain that the roots of any conflict are much more ancient. According to the historians Kodi Mahamat and Mahamat Saleh Yacoub (North- South Conflict, Myth or Reality?), despite a series of violent acts perpetrated by Muslim sovereigns against peoples in the South, the collective memory has not retained an unaton able rancour vis-\u00e0-vis Muslims and the repercus sions of this on current dissent should therefore not be exaggerated. Furthermore, North-South Cotton was introduced into the South by colonisers | the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "antagonism, if any, should be sought in the differing evolution of these two areas during the colonial period. There are many who share this point of view. French colonisers undoubtedly had a major influence on North/South relations; firstly be\u00ad cause, unlike the North, which was hostile, the South was much more receptive to colonial rule. This is why it was easy to introduce the teaching of French and therefore of French culture into the South, whereas the North rejected an education which did not include the teaching of Arabic or the Koran. Similarly, Christianity made numerous converts in the South, with its missions and the latter's influence on healthcare and education. Subsequently, the colonial authorities imposed the growing of cotton in the South, and this rapidly led to the South being called 'useful' and the North 'useless'. In brief, as Bernard Lanne explains so succinctly in his work Conflits et violences au Tchad, from 1920 to 1960, society in the North was content to remain faithful to the past and it experienced stagnation, its economy evolving very little. The South, on the other hand, attracted by the vices and pleasures of the modern world, overthrew its existing structures and propelled its youth towards a new era. As a result, when Chad obtained independence in 1960, North and South were not side\u00adby\u00adside, but face\u00adto\u00adface. Since independence, another factor has come into play. North\u00adSouth differences have been taken over, exacerbated and embittered by Chad's politics. According to Gilbert Maoundo\u00ad nodji, the North\u00adSouth conflict exists insofar as politicians have used a number of sociological faults to cultivate differences which, elsewhere, are riches. Chad has been an independent nation for close on 40 years: 20 years of 'Southern government', 20 years of 'Northern government' \u00ad and 30 years of civil war! From Stockbreeders are also found in the South Tombalbaye to D\u00e9by, through Malloum and Habr\u00e9, all politicians have made use of North/ South sentiment \u00ad admittedly to varying degrees and with more or less serious consequences \u00ad with instances of social injustice establishing the gulf between the communities once and for all. Abuses have been such that it now appears impossible not to interpret one or another method of government as a practice intended to promote one community at the expense of another. This is true at all levels of power. Today, the nomination of a town's mayor, yesterday the conferral of diplomas, tomorrow the awarding of study grants. There is an ongoing feeling of frustration on both sides, in one place in terms of education (the South has much higher rates of literacy, as it was the only one to accept 'the white man's school'), in another the division of power and national wealth (now possessed by the North alone?). Falling back on identities More than any others, two factors in particular form the core of the obstacle which prevents North and South living peacefully together: language and religion. As proof of this, the (bilingual) Al Mouna Centre organised its sec\u00ad ond colloquium, in 1998, to refine the work of the first, which took place in 1996. As before, the proceedings were published, this time entitled Le contentieux linguistique arabe\u00adfran\u00ad \u00e7ais (The Arabic/French language dispute). 1998 was also the year for conferences dealing with religion and the issue of secularity. Some hold that the language issue is even more sensitive than that of religion, although, as is to be expected, others think the opposite. Language the Courier n c 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 \u0392 ",
        "and religion are in any case very closely linked, Arabic being easily understood as meaning Islamic. The South's supporters, for example, fear the imposition of Arabic and thus of Islam, and the consequent loss of their own identity. As far as language is concerned, a basic charter, published in 1982, announced that Arabic was to become the nation's official language. This decision was disputed by a sizeable, non\u00adIslamic portion of the population, but the referendum on adoption of the 1996 constitution granted Arabic joint official status with French. Since independence, the respective position of one language or the other has often been a source of tension. According to Henri Coudray, when the North rebelled against the South's hold on power, the 'Arabic question' very quickly gained symbolic status and became central to the rebels' demands. Much later, during the 1993 national conference, the issue of the translation of the discussions arose \u00ad into Arabic, naturally, but which Arabic? Written Arabic or Chad's local version? Discussion quickly turned into violent confrontation, with the South, but also a major part of the North, opting for the second. This was the final choice, much to the chagrin of Arabists. However, debate on the respective status of French and Arabic in Chad shapes society's choices, obedience to government and the struggle for power, a struggle in which denominational references are invoked, for better or for worse. Arabists, for example, require Arabic to be given equal status with French in political, administrative and educa\u00ad tional life. The issues of language and religion are inex\u00ad tricably linked. Language is interpreted as the vector for a religion and a civilisation which the others are not ready to accept. Although evidence shows that Christianity followed on from colonisation (from 1920 onwards), the date The marabout holds the keys to understanding the Koran Many people attended the consecration of the new church in Fl\u00e4nga, close to the border with Cameroon on which Islam arrived in Chad depends on the source consulted. According to a study carried out by the Panos Institute (Between sand dunes and savannah... Chad and its environment), the conversion to Islam of certain populations, notably those in the Sahelian region, signifi\u00ad cantly predates the arrival of the nomadic Arab tribes and can be placed in about the 9th century. Originating from the Middle East and from the Maghreb, Islam firstly, quite naturally, conquered the principal ethnic groups living in the Sahara and Sahel. Current estimates are that approximately 55% of the total population is Muslim. Some intellectuals maintain that Chad is the victim of 'creeping' conversion to Islam, a point of view which is far from being shared by all but which is nevertheless not without significance. According to Nadia Karaki, Director of the Al Mouna Centre, Islam, by its very nature, is not secular, and state and religion go hand in hand. Everyone therefore believes that if the Islamic faith advances, the state will lose its secular character whereas, for Christians, secularity is a safeguard against the North's power. Language and religion, and the North\u00ad South conflict, therefore, have as a backdrop a deeper concern for Chad's very system of government. What does the future hold for Chad's government? While certain Arabists would willingly call the constitutional secularity of Chad into question, others, this time in the South, would opt, almost with their eyes closed, for a federation. Un\u00ad thinkable, perhaps, but the issue is already under discussion. Could this be a temporary solution, eventually enabling a reunified state to come into being? Or, now that mutual antagonism is so deeply rooted, could this be a more likely final solution? Everyone's answer is different. Chad is a patchwork of languages, peoples and also of division. Certainly, the political conditions allowing understanding to develop between the different communities do not yet exist. Whether myth or reality, the North\u00adSouth conflict is unavoidably always part of everyday life: history, religion, regionalism, politics, identity, language \u00ad everything is inter\u00ad linked, according to Nadia Karaki, and everyone is involved by virtue of a deeply\u00adfelt attachment to his or her own, personal national identity. \u25a01 T.G. the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "N'Djamena - w ho exactly are y o u? N'Djamena the Amazon. A Sahelian city cloaked in a sandy mantle; an intriguing city where, rumour has it, every man has a weapon concealed about him. Although not permanent, the feeling of insecurity never really leaves one. Latent violence fills the overdry atmosphere, hanging heavy. From Diguel to Farcha, from Am-Rigu\u00e9b\u00e9 to Mour- sal, at the markets or behind the facades of the buildings, the gaze of the men is harsh, a testament to long years of fratricidal conflict. Even the silence bears witness to an under current of feuding, particularly when the unlit streets seem just that little bit too dark. Gunshots sometimes ring out in the night, as they did yesterday when two customs officers were gunned down by smugglers on the banks of the River Shari. Many of the houses on the river bank bear the scars of past skirmishes - despite the mud bricks having been rendered with clay, not all of them are able to hide the bullet marks. N'Djamena, has its masculine side. As a minibus makes a sudden appearance; a street urchin without his papers is challenged. The male smell of these 'red carpets', when police officers clad in blue and nomad guards in fatigues block off the city's main routes. They will have no hesitation in levelling their Kalachnikov at you, should they detect the least resistance. All this is usually over quite quickly, as the presidential cavalcade speeds past the city's landmarks. Nevertheless, even when one is used to this, a Kalachnikov still sends a shiver down one's spine. N'Djamena, the 'dustbin city' to those who would describe your urban environment, particularly during the rainy season. You are the victim of your location, susceptible to flooding, of your lack of character, perhaps, and of the haphazard way in which your inhabitants have settled here. Yet there is a gentle side to you, N'Djamena. The gently flowing water which carries dug out canoes and provides fishermen with a catch, at the confluence of the Shari and Logone rivers. Many birds have taken up residence here, sometimes even hippopota muses. A gentle way of life flows beneath the feet of the people crossing the Chagoua Bridge. Even the darkness is gentle, when children's faces glow in the light of oil lamps, when music can be heard as, sudden voices ring out from your Christian districts and the muezzin's call to prayer is carried by the hot Harmattan winds. By day, your avenues provide a welcome shade. What of your feminine side, when a thousand different colours fill the markets or are glimpsed in a gated courtyard. In your hustle and bustle of fabrics and spices, you are female; female in the work carried out and the distance covered, female even in the names of the districts on the banks of your curving river - Sabangali, Farcha, Chagoua, Milezi. Finally, N'Djamena, you are a paragon, be yond compare - Chad's melting pot of ingredients, a mixture of languages and customs overlooked by a majestic cathedral and the minarets of the Faisal Mosque. In 1965, Pierre Hugot described you as 'a city born of the human substance of the Sahel and of the cotton-growing area, but much more than the sum of the country's two major regions - N'Djamena has long been a sepa rate, individual phenomenon'.

        "Field doctors Mongo Hospital, 10 a.m. About a dozen women are already waiting, sitting on the stone bench, each with a child on her hip. It is a colourful scene: the green doors, the brick- red walls and, most obviously, a veritable rainbow of fabrics. Veils, turbans, yellow boubous splashed with midnight blue, orange streaked with violet, and turquoise dotted with pink. There is also white, on the ceilings and as part of the posters on the right-hand wall. These present hygiene rules and advice, as well as the steps to be taken to ensure good nutrition. Child health is still a major concern here, just as it is throughout Chad. Finally, the door opens. 'Next!'...and a wo men leaves the room, holding her infant in her arms. A large, straggling village in the north of the Le G\u00fcera region, practically bordering Le Batha, Mongo is some 500 kilometres east of N'Djamena - just under 10 hours by road in the dry season (the issue of travel does not even arise during the winter season). Just like the health infrastructures in the seven other administrative districts in 'the North' (Batha, BET, Biltine, Kanem, Lac, Ouadda'i and Sala mat), its hospital was recently overhauled and refitted. Proof of this is the freshness of the various cubicles and the pharmacy, as well as the medical and technical equipment it now has. The hospital's senior doctor told us: 'We have a 120-bed capacity. Patients are pro cessed initially through the health centre, where they have their consultation. It's only if they require more in-depth treatment that they are sent here'. And what of the cost? For an adult, CFAF 400, for a child, CFAF 200, payable at the health centre. In the event of hospitalisation, CFAF 1000 is the cost per week. The hospital has eight members of staff, including midwives. Refitting and reconstruction, organisation and management, coverage of costs and medical cover, training... these are all differ ent facets of a single large project initiated in July 1992 and allocated a total of \u20ac19.7m under the 7th EDF. Like the previous fund, its general aim is to 'develop health services at district health-authority level', in both quan titative and qualitative terms. To this end, work is structured so as to cater for four specific objectives: - at central level, a contribution to the definition of the national health policy and to the process of decentralisation; - at intermediate level, support for the development of a district health administra tion; - at regional-hospital and health-district level, development of health services and improve ment of the quality of care; - at the level of all public health structures, a regular supply of essential medicines. Qualified research personnel These objectives also include the training of doctors and of paramedics, an essential task, according to Mahamat Louani Goadi, Director General of Health, because Chad suffers from an enormous shortfall in terms of human resources, both in the numbers and the quality of the personnel. Very often, health centres have only nurses without any medical training. Trained solely on the job - 'man oeuvres' is the term used here - they some times even have to make a highly specific diagnosis and carry out prenatal examina tions! Within the context of training doctors, public- health grants have been awarded to seven doctors, enabling them to complete courses in public health and to commence (and, for some, even to finish) their research work. Other, younger doctors have benefited the Courier n c 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "through the training and assessment system. This is the case, for example, of Abdoulaye Hassane, whom we met in Ati, a village on the edge of the Sahel, on the borders of the Sahara. Qualified as a doctor of medicine in the former USSR, he took part in a number of training courses there and, after a positive assessment, has since been appointed senior doctor - and thus overall manager - at the hospital. The project also includes training for nurses and health technicians, with ongoing training organised in the form of workshops. The responsibility for all this falls to the district administrative representative in consultation with the senior doctor. A number of nurses and technicians also receive specialised train ing - one nurse at the hospital in Ati has been trained as an anaesthetist. Supervisory visits by whomever is generally responsible for training are made as often as possible, and provide an opportunity to give judicious advice, both to doctors and to nurses, and also to listen to what they have to say about any problems they may have. Dr Charles Sani has had this role since 1994: 'Doctors enter into a kind of contract with the Ministry, under which they make them selves available to EDF zone representatives for four years. In exchange, the EDF awards them a technical qualification. The fact that the doctors are responsible for the hospitals enables the representatives, freed from this burden, to concentrate on health coverage in a specific district'. He also emphasised the important snowballing effect of such train ing: 'We have been urging the Ministry to operate the scheme at national level and training courses are now obligatory for all Chad's doctors'. Medicine goes generic Another major component of the project is the supply of medicines. A central purchasing pharmacy was set up in November 1996 to supply essential generic medicines to health infrastructures. Its role is 'to purchase and to sell medicines at a price the people can afford and in amounts that avoid items being out of Water management... stock'. The Project helped to set up this central purchasing agency and uses it to supply the health structures in the EDF zone's eight districts. As part of the scheme to decentralise the distribution of medicines, district pharmacies have been built in the zone's eight adminis trative areas. The Project has also provided management training to promote the smooth running of these pharmacies, and training of laboratory assistants. One pharmacist told us that the average cost of an item of medicine varies between CFAF 1000 and 1400 at the hospital. In private pharmacies, the cost may be as much as CFAF 8000 to 10,000. Furthermore, this system makes it possible to avoid the use of medi cines bought at market (there is still a high degree of self-prescription of medicines). In the vast majority of cases, such medicines are often out-of-date and have been 'baked' in the sun, and are sold by traders who are totally incompetent to advise on their use. A great many medicines, therefore, are used for the wrong purpose. Admittedly, it is not always an easy task to guarantee the stock of medicines, particularly in the more remote regions and during the winter season. Trucks transport goods from the capital, and district pharmacies purchase their generic medicines from the purchasing centre, particularly under the cost-coverage Less than 10% of deliveries in Mongo are assisted the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",

Still in its infancy in most hospitals, dispensaries and other health centres, 'cover age' was born of the concept of community involvement (the Bamako initiative). Although, in former times, health services in Chad were free (they still are in certain regions which have not yet got used to the new system), payment for care and medicines does help local health structures remain independent. In Mongo, for example, where the coverage system is well established, the community has appointed a management committee responsible for managing funds via a post office account, with the money received being paid to the district pharmacy for the purchase of medicines. Despite its advantages, this cost-coverage system is, nevertheless, limited, quite simply because the purchasing power of the local population is restricted. CFAF 1000 would normally feed a family of five or six people for a week. Many regret the passing of free healthcare, as a portion of the population no longer has access to medical services. 'Although, officially, the cost of medicine is fixed by decree, unofficially it is sometimes much greater...', Charles Sani acknowledges unhappily. Vaccination and awareness programmes are top priority Other improvements are also being made at several levels. Dr Sani told us: 'Although the war destroyed the existing health infrastruc ture, the projects I've been telling you about have enabled us quite quickly to re-establish some kind of healthcare. Also, national policy is fairly well defined; for instance, there is clear geographical division and definition of the activities to be carried out. The problem arises, however, in the implementation of that policy. We lack staff, political abuse is widespread, structural adjustment has had a disastrous effect on recruitment, and there are problems of salary arrears and thus of motivation. The EDF health project is ob viously making an enormous contribution to the eight districts in the North where, with the exception of Le G\u00fcera, only the EU is doing anything about health. Nevertheless, if we're to reach the point where hospitals are genuinely operational, we must have more qualified staff. The same goes for equipment and hygiene at welfare centres. We also desperately need mobile personnel'. All of this is quite logical. So is the rate of death in childbirth - fewer than 10% of deliveries in Mongo are assisted, and two out of three pregnancies in N'Djamena are not monitored - and the infant mortality rate in Chad remains very high. According to the most recent statistics, 92 children in every 1000 die each year. In the opinion of a number of doctors we met, this trend looks set to continue, although with its ups and downs. More and more of the patients in the various hospitals and clinics in Chad are children suffering from malnutrition, respira tory disorders, epidemics (measles, cholera, tuberculosis, etc.) and, of course, malaria (particularly during the rainy season). Unfortunately, such children receive too little - or no - benefit from mass vaccination campaigns. Awareness-promotion campaigns are also needed. A doctor in the capital told us that since 1991, cholera epidemics have been on the increase because 'no one ex plains to the people how to manage water, how to improve daily hygiene, etc.' Radio awareness-promotion campaigns have been implemented in the past... but there is also a shortage of radio sets. 'Child vaccination and the suppression of epidemics can only be achieved with the help of \"mobile medicine\".' At Mongo Hospital, it is already midday. The stone benches in the waiting room alongside the paediatric department are still as full as ever. IH T.G. G the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "Culture and society \u00ed s *K Stolen heritage Researchers from both northern and southern hemispheres have spent many years collaborat ing in the fields of archaeology, exhibitions and museums. The result: over two decades of excavation and discovery throughout the Niger basin, leading to the 'Vall\u00e9es du Niger' exhibi tion, a runaway success which has taken the heritage of African societies, in the form of 200 objects found in the soil, to Europe and Africa. Yet the price of success is looting. Works of art stolen from Africa turn up in the private collections of unscrupulous individuals. In Nia mey, archaeologists working on the Bura site are calling for a halt to this slow drain on Niger's historical legacy so future generations may continue to enjoy their artistic and histor ical heritage. The Vall\u00e9es du Niger exhibition, opened in Paris in 1994, took its treasures to Leyden, Bamako, Ouagadougou, Lagos, Nouakchott, Conakry and, finally, the National Museum in Niamey, the last stage of its journey, in 1998. The fruit of close collaboration between six museums and re search institutions in Africa, France and the Netherlands, this collection helped heighten public awareness of the fundamental impor tance of archaeology in gaining knowledge about the past. Excavations have helped recon struct the history of the African continent, about which, in truth, little is yet known. However, in order to reconstruct the past, the heritage which lies underground has to be protected and studied in minute detail. The necropolis at Bura Burial of the dead has always been a human preoccupation. At Bura, in Niger, intact and dated tombs have enabled researchers to carry out important scientific work which is now in its final phase. These days. Bura is a quiet little village, some 145 kilometres from Niamey. As we passed through, women momentarily stopped working in order to cast an indifferent glance in our direction, whilst laughing children chased after us for a short distance. There was no way they could keep up with the four-wheel drive of Professor Boub\u00e9 Gado, from Niamey's Human Science Research Institute (IRSH), who is leading the dig. We turned down a track and very quickly left all civilisation behind. It is not difficult to imagine what this area must have been like in the past; the landscape must have been very similar centuries ago. About ten kilometres further on, the driver commented that the archaeologists were going to be taken by surprise by our arrival, as they were not expecting us. Indeed, a number of heads popped up out of the ground, as it were, to watch our approach. About ten men, their faces protected by masks, were moving carefully about a large open trench. After a moment's hesitation on our part, we responded to their enthusiastic welcome. Armed with brushes and buckets, they were engaged in a peculiar task - dusting off skeletons. The image was a striking one; the scene resembled for all the world a charnel-house, except for the fact that the dead were laid out with care, confirming that this had been a cemetery. The researchers were attempt ing to penetrate the mystery contained in the tombs. The Bura site is a superb example of the possibilities offered by stylistic and laboratory analyses, demonstrating that previously formed ideas about the ancient history of the Niger Valley should be reexamined. As a whole, the necropolis occupied several hundred square metres, and the land has been excavated to a depth of two metres. All information relating to burials between the second and eleventh cen turies has thus been uncovered and coordinated. Work on the site is divided into roped-off squares of land which makes it possible to establish the precise geographical and height coordinates of any items found. This site is one of a number in the middle valley (between Gao and the border with Benin), with a highly characteristic funerary statuary, and this is the first time, in this portion of the river, that such important information has come to light. Reconstruction of the archaeological sites In the trench, students and volunteers are learning the procedures involved in scientific the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 B ",
        "excavations from their more experienced collea gues. One of them, Doula Sancii, does not have a European university education: he is from Bura itself, which he left at the age of 20 in order to go to the capital. He began work at the IRSCH as a driver, when research was still being super vised by the CNRS. It was there that he met Boub\u00e9 Gado, in 1969. He continued to work with him, not only as a driver but also as an archaeological assistant, learning the trade 'on the job'. He proved to be a talented worker, since it was thanks to his assistance that every thing got off the ground. In 1976, his brother confided to him that he had found some statuettes. He showed him one of them; the other having been lost by his children who had been playing with it. He told us, 'Boub\u00e9 immediately realised the importance of the find and we came back. We dug in this very spot, where Abdou collected the statuettes, and we sent two of them back to Niamey'. Boub\u00e9 Gado did all he could to obtain meagre funding from the University of Niamey and from the France/Niger cooperation arrangement. The in itial excavations were made in 1983, and archaeologists explored the site for five months. It quickly became obvious that a survey was needed. They dug further, consolidating the trench. What they discovered was beyond their wildest dreams - statuettes, pottery, jewellery, etc. Funeral urns originally supported the deco rated figures, and these were placed on top of the deceased whom they represented. Between 1983 and 1985, excavation work was intensified, although interrupted by the rains. Stratigraphy revealed the objects which were to be included in the Valleys of the Niger exhibition. The jewellery, bracelets and necklaces are irreplace able points of reference in studying the social, artistic and chronological aspects of the produc tion of ancient terracotta. A magnificient piece was chosen to appear on the cover of the exhibition catalogue: the great Bura horseman, recreated from broken fragments and restored by the laboratory at the Museum of Arts from Africa and Oceania, in Paris. In the second stage, \"=\u00a3-. . v -\"^|: the tombs were uncovered, obviously the first generation of burials. At the moment, the archaeologists are very busy, work having been restarted two months ago. They are still concentrating on the ochre earth, in which they have uncovered three sectors - C2, C3 and D3, at a depth of 180 cm. Nevertheless, it is a hard job and progress is slow, because the skeletons are scattered about haphazardly. One of the specialists told us, 'Our aim is to dig down to unproductive earth, virgin soil, if you like, where there are no further levels of burials. The layer we're clearing at the moment has to be the first of four or five generations of burials, dating from about the 11th century. We're therefore hoping to find tombs dating from the 3rd century, which corresponds to the actual age of the site'. This means nine centuries of continuous use of the necropolis, enabling a range of conclusions to be drawn. Researchers are trained on the site itself: they are taught how to use their brush, how to move around inside the trench, and how not to damage the skeletons, whose bones have be come very fragile in the acid soil. 'Another thing we have to contend with is the reality of life in an underdeveloped country. We do not have suitable products, no hardening agent for example. We looked for Rodopast M everywhere in Niamey so that we could consolidate, but there wasn't any. So we're unable to consolidate and to uncover different areas progressively. If we had Rodopast, we would be able to move the skeletons. Without it, we will have to leave them where they are, study them as much as we can and then replace the earth on top'. Another solution would be to create a museum, which is the dream of Boub\u00e9 Gado's team - they would like to continue work, to study living conditions and personal effects. The professor makes a sweeping gesture - one could dig practically anywhere at random and be sure of uncovering new sites. Respect for objects in their context The principal problem the archaeologists are attempting to address is widespread looting, which is a major threat to the continuation of archaeological work in Africa. Every object taken from its context results in a total loss of the information it can offer. After removal, it no longer constitutes a historical, stratigraphie, chronological or cultural sign. Initially, the discovery of artefacts was of no interest to anyone in the nearby village. The items predated Islam, and the local people felt the site did not concern them. Then the exhibi tion opened. Practically the day after the artefacts went on show in Paris, in 1993, revealing the existence of the necropolis to the world at large, the 'vultures' arrived. Most of the cemeteries were ransacked by locals, who quickly understood that such artefacts had a commercial value. The Bura site, guarded from the outset, is still protected - the tombs are of no interest to anyone at the moment, apart from the curious few who watch progress from a distance. In any case, Professor Gado's team has taken great pains to explain to local villagers that no one should come near. 'We're not quite so happy about the situation now', explained Doula Sandi. 'One day, a European arrived in Tera, a village not far from here. One of the villagers went out to fetch the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "three stone statuettes and asked CFAF 5000 for them, which is the cost of the journey to Niamey. They go round the villages every year, asking for statuettes, but these traffickers have not yet reached us here, because the villagers are aware of the situation. And, anyway, when we leave for anything like a longish period, we cover up the site. Not far from here, there's a site which has been completely looted, and we ended up having to post two guards there in order to stop the theft'. Topo, another victim of looting Professor Boub\u00e9 Gado led us to this infamous, looted site, which has been christened Topo, after its principal raider. The latter, after selling the statuettes he had uncovered on his land, realised he had a regular goldmine, which enabled him to open up a small shop. He became a man of substance. Topo laughs at the archaeologists, pitying them 'with their little brushes and their pans', which they use to dig out the earth. He has gone to town on 'his' site \u00ad holes are dug anywhere, and pottery and statuettes are broken. For every item in good condition, how many are destroyed? The most recent purchaser arrived just the day before our visit in a bush taxi, to buy a statuette from a child. He paid CFAF 10,000, a veritable fortune as far as the child was concerned. It could bring him up to CFAF 50 million. Making life difficult for the middlemen So, what can be done to stem the tide? Boub\u00e9 Gado has set about this task. 'In the beginning, we were completely on our own, but we have gradually tried to make the press more aware of the situation. We've had meetings with UNESCO, to decide on an approach. At the time, there was no legislation to protect us, and the authorities were not very interested. We had to persuade the government to pass a law and an implementing decree to protect the country's Fragments of statuettes ready to leave for the laboratory heritage. Some authorities don't see the point of making the effort and it's still extremely easy to take such pieces out of the country. At the airport, Customs just doesn't have the equip\u00ad ment to control trafficking'. Poverty is such that people will continue to sell for as long as they are able. A single sale may earn them the equivalent of a year's wages. One can' under\u00ad stand why they do it, but one does not have to accept it. Furthermore, the international trade in stolen artefacts uses highly organised net\u00ad works. Professor Gado is hoping to set up a system involving the villagers themselves. 'To an extent, the archaeologists are responsible. They have to learn how to behave \u00ad how to integrate with the local population, without trampling on moral values and local concerns. Local people have to develop an interest and become in\u00ad volved in the research, they should profit from any economic benefit'. First and foremost, the work has to continue and to grow. 'To take care of Topo, we're having to level everything to a depth of at least 50cm, clear the waste material and divide the area into squares, but we've still no idea when we'll be able to begin excava\u00ad tions. Our problem is lack of funding. The site ought to be excavated urgently and we have already located another site which is still preserved and looks very promising. We have to work fast because there's a risk of our continent's history just disappearing', \u03b2 A.K. Illegal traffic in cultural artefacts Everyone has a part to play: an appeal has been sent out to museums, sales rooms, dealers and collectors by the International Museums Council (ICOM), asking them no longer to purchase objects of doubtful provenance. The ICOM, based in Paris and financed, in particular, by UNESCO, has set up AFRICOM, a programme covering museums in Africa. In this way, a set of projects is being implemented by the continent's museums. AFRICOM offers training and education modules, stages exhibitions and is setting up an African network. Regional workshops have been organised with a view to setting up cooperation between museums, the police and the customs service. In 1997, it reprinted Cent objets disparus. Pillage en Afrique [One hundred lost artefacts: looting from Africa], a reference work presenting a wide range of thefts of all types perpetrated on that continent. By virtue of the wide circulation of this publication, articles stolen from museums or looted from archaeological sites have been found on the art market, particularly in Europe. The ICOM is also working to mobilise those responsible for African collections, in Europe and North America, who, together with museums, share responsibility for worldwide promotion of Africa's cultural heritage. Aided by a network of professionals, the ICOM is receiving more and more reports of the existence of questionable artefacts on the art market. In this way, it has been possible to return certain items to the countries from where they were originally stolen. Finally, another weapon in the war, the ICOM Red List lists categories of archaeological objects which are particularly likely to be stolen. The list was drawn up during a workshop which, for the first time, brought together Africans, Europeans and Americans in Amsterdam in 1997.

At 64 years of age, the Senegalese sculptor has become, perhaps somewhat against his will, the spokes person for the continent's artists. They have grown tired of the critics' tendency to stereotype them as 'man ufacturers of tradition'. Here on the bridge, you won't find any masks or 'typical' examples of naive art. The 68 works on display are the successful outcome of a head-to-head struggle with the raw materials, the artist having chosen themes from a much broader historical can vas. This was confirmed by Ibrahim Loutou, President of Afrique en Cr\u00e9ations who explained; 'Ousmane Sow wanted this time to engage in a dialogue with America and its native peoples. This fact illustrates something that Africa has always in sisted upon, namely to achieve an opening to the world based on the universal values that bring humanity together and, at the same time, contribute to its replen ishment. The genius of Ous mane Sow gives us the plea sure of emotions shared in timately with the world as a whole. And it enables Africa to project its own excellence, nobility and courage...

        "Sustainable tourism development is about safeguarding and maintaining the resources that tourism is built on - economic, ecological, cultural and social. The aim is to ensure that these remain intact so as to benefit not just today's generation but also our children and their children, the stakeholders of tomorrow. Over the last 50 years, tourism has gained increasing re\u00ad cognition as an important sector with enormous potential for gen\u00ad erating economic growth and em\u00ad ployment. Industry experts and visionaries already proclaim that tourism is the world's largest in\u00ad dustry. In the 21st century, we are told, it will be the largest industry the world has ever seen. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, in 1999, the sector will generate, directly and indirectly, 11.7% of world GDP and provide nearly 200 million jobs. The latter figure is forecast to rise by more than five million jobs a year over the next decade. In its favour, tourism has numerous advantages over other industries. Being heterogeneous, it is seen to have many direct and indirect benefits for the wider economy. Employment is gener\u00ad ated not only in the wide range of service sectors directly linked to tourism but also in retail, construc\u00ad tion, manufacturing, and telecom\u00ad munications - all sectors with a future. High proportions of wo\u00ad men and young people are em\u00ad ployed by the small and medium sized enterprises that comprise much of the industry. It can even regenerate regions (rural or indus\u00ad trial) previously in decline. Com\u00ad pared to manufacturing, tourism has relatively less impact on nat\u00ad ural resources and the environ\u00ad ment. Being based on enjoyment and appreciation of the locations in which it takes place, there are strong incentives to protect and maintain those elements which attract tourists - such as the built and natural environment and the local cultural heritage and tradi\u00ad tions. Technological advances are making travel easier than ever before and increasing numbers of people are travelling annually to consume ever more varied tourism 'products' in ever more far-flung destinations. It is easy to see why many consider tourism an engine for future development offering nu\u00ad merous opportunities. Many ACP countries rich in tourism resources are increasingly recognising their wealth. For entrepreneurs large and small, those looking for em\u00ad ployment, and communities want\u00ad ing to promote their culture and traditions, tourism is a relatively easy industry to enter. More and more people in Europe and North America, the major source mar\u00ad kets, are seeking novel opportu\u00ad nities for rest and relaxation, or adventure. Tourism seemingly has something for everyone. At the same time there are challenges which have to be re\u00ad solved if the potential benefits are to be equitably shared out among all those who have a stake in the industry. There is an ever-present risk that the very development of the industry will lead to destruc\u00ad tion and degradation. Unplanned and poorly managed tourism schemes are capable of defiling much in their wake: from fragile ecological habitats and their bio\u00ad diversity to the livelihoods of the local host populations and their environmental and cultural heri\u00ad tage. 'Paradise' destinations can be laid bare for visitors and hosts alike. Thus, the challenge is to manage the growth of tourism, its consumption and the waste that it generates. This is vital to ensure that in the long-term, it remains a sector that is sustainable economically, environmentally and socially for all those involved. \u039c\u0388 co. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "The World Tourism Organisa\u00ad tion predicts 21st century tourism will be the antidote to high\u00adtech living. Here, the WTO Secretary General dis\u00ad cusses their new report Tourism: 2020 Vision. The year 2020 will see the penetration of technology into all aspects of life. It will become possi\u00ad ble to live one's days without ex\u00ad posure to other people, according to WTO's latest look into the future. But this bleak prognosis has a silver lining for the tourism sector. People in the high\u00adtech future will crave the human touch and tourism will be the principal means to achieve this. Tourism companies that manage to provide 'high\u00adtouch' pro\u00ad ducts will prosper. Upscale, luxury services that pamper and spoil their customers have a bright future in the upcoming century. But WTO's report also predicts good prospects for low\u00adbudget destinations and packages.

Oppor\u00ad tunities abound at both ends of the spectrum and there will be plenty of them. $5 billion a day industry WTO's study. Tourism: 2020 Vision, predicts 1.5 billion tourists will be visiting foreign countries annually by the year 2020, spending more than $2 trillion \u00ad or $5 billion every day! These forecasts represent nearly three times more interna\u00ad tional tourists than the 625 million recorded in 1998 and nearly five times more tourism spending, which last year topped $444 billion. Tourist arrivals are predicted to grow by an average 4.3% a year over the next two decades, while receipts from international tourism will climb by 6.7% a year. To factor in domestic tourism, WTO multiplies arrivals by 10 and quadruples re\u00ad ceipts, which brings us to the grand totals of 16 billion tourists spending $8 trillion in 2020. Tourism in the 21st century will not only be the world's biggest industry, it will be the largest by far that the world has ever seen. Along with its phenomenal growth and size, the tourism industry will also have to take on more responsibility for its extensive impacts. Not only its economic effects but also the impact on the environment, on societies and on cultural sites, all of which will be increasingly scrutinised by governments, consumer groups and the travelling public. We hope that Tourism: 2020 Vision will be more than a useful marketing tool; that it will act as a warning signal for destinations \u00ad helping them recognise the need to prepare for the pressures of growth. WTO is advising destinations to im\u00ad plement long\u00adterm, strategic plan\u00ad ning and to strengthen the partner\u00ad ships, both strategically and at the operational level, between the pub\u00ad lic and private sectors. Tourism: 2020 Vision indi\u00ad cates that tourists of the 21st cen\u00ad tury will be travelling further afield on their holidays, often to China, and even to outer space! The per\u00ad centage of long\u00adhaul travel is pre\u00ad dicted to increase from 18% in 1995 to 24% by 2020. Tourism companies looking to cash in on this booming sector are advised to look towards Asia.

Short pleasure voyages to outer space will become a reality by 2004 or 2005, according to a study carried out by WTO Statistics Chief, Enzo Paci, in consultation with 85 governments and 50 tourism 'visionaries'. It is expected that space trips will last up to four days and cost, on average, $100,000. NASA, the US space agency, has recently recently surveyed the travel industry for interest in space tourism and some US companies are already taking reservations and deposits from private citizens hoping to be come the first tourists in outer space. But while some travellers may be suiting up for extra-terres trial voyages, the vast majority of the world's population will never leave their own countries, not even by the year 2020. The study con cludes that only 7% of the global population will be travelling inter nationally by the year 2020, up from 3.5% in 1996 - but still just the tip of the iceberg. European trends Tourism: 2020 Vision, which will be published next year in a series of detailed regional volumes, predicts that Europe will remain by far the leading inbound tourism region as well as the main generator of international tourists. Interna tional arrivals in Europe will reach 717 million by 2020 - more than twice as many as last year. Overall tourism to Europe is predicted to grow more slowly than the world average; at a rate of 3.1% annually, though some countries will fare better than others. Central and Eastern European countries will be come the new motor for Europe, feeding and being fed by other European and long-haul generating markets. Tourism to Central and Eastern Europe will grow by 4.8% a year and the former Soviet bloc countries will surpass 200 million arrivals by 2016 - a doubling in just 15 years. The Eastern Mediterranean countries of Cyprus, Turkey and Israel are also expected to show good growth of 4.6% a year. Tour ism to the United Kingdom is fore cast to grow by 4% annually, just under the world average. Reflecting world patterns and increasing air travel, Europeans will be taking trips more frequently and further from home.

Long-haul travel to countries outside Europe will grow by 6.1% a year in the coming decades to reach 15% of all trips taken by Europeans (or more than 115 million depar tures). Long-haul currently accounts for 12% of European outbound travel or about 42 million trips a year. Since the typical European tourist who spends his holiday at the beach will more frequently be choosing Asian or Caribbean resorts, European beach destinations are advised to orient their product de velopment and marketing increas ingly to new tourist sources, espe cially Japan, the newly industrialised countries of Asia or the Americas. Mature European destinations will continually have to strive to seek product and market differentiation to avoid a tired or stale image in major generating markets. While growth of the tourism industry will be unstoppable in the 21st century, increased benefits can not be taken for granted. Competi tion among destinations will also become increasingly fierce. The study Tourism: 2020 Vi sion, outlines a series of 12 'mega trends' that will shape the sector, and offers advice on how better to compete. No destination or tourism operator can afford to sit back and wait for more tourists to arrive. They have to be won - and there will be winners and losers. To be a winner, there are a number of imperatives: - Development focused on quality and sustainability; - Value for money; ' - Full utilisation of information technology to identify and commu nicate effectively with market seg ments and niches. Product development and marketing will need to match each other more closely, based on the main travel motivators of the 21st century. Tourism: 2020 Vision calls these motivating factors the three 'E's - entertainment, excitement and education. The study also highlights the importance of image in a tourist's selection of a holiday destination in the future. While an image of safety and security is already an important deciding factor for tourists, holiday- makers of the 21st century will be looking for places with a trendy \u00a1mage. As 2020 Vision points out, the next century will mark the emergence of tourism destinations as a 'fashion accessory'. The choice of location for a holiday will help define the identity of the traveller and, in an increasingly homogenous world, set him apart from the hordes of other tourists.

        "Leisure t i me squeeze w i ll h it t o u r i sm For many people, working hours are increasing by Colin Clarke* The Business Council of the World Tourism Organisation recently commissioned tour\u00ad ism, hotel and leisure indus\u00ad tries consultancy, Horwath UK, to see whether, in an increasingly competitive world, leisure time is endan\u00ad gered and if so, how the tourism industry should re\u00ad spond. The startling conclu\u00ad sion of the study is that, far from leisure time continuing to increase throughout the world, the amount of leisure time available to many is likely to decline. The effect of this squeeze will be to accelerate the trend towards shorter, more frequent holidays. It will also favour the expansion of quickly accessible holiday destinations in the same region or time zone. The research finds that reductions in the work\u00ad ing week have slowed consider\u00ad ably in the last decade as the world economy has become more competitive. As a result, working time has become more flexible, and employment and pension ar\u00ad rangements less secure. Traditionally it had been expected that economic advances would improve the quality of life and lead to a new golden age of leisure, but the study indicates that where work pressures are increasing and leisure time con\u00ad stantly being squeezed, the quality of life may be falling. For many employees, particularly managers and professionals, working hours have actually increased because companies are facing ever more intense global competition. Competitive markets are forcing companies to downsize and to minimise employee costs. *A director of the tourism, hotel and leisure industries consultancy, Horwath UK, Chairman of the British Standards Institute Committee on Tourism Standards and a former director of the British Tourist Authority and English Tourist Board. of which holidays and pensions are among the most expensive. At the same time, technology is making employers less dependent on man\u00ad power and this cycle encourages workers to safeguard their jobs by working longer hours. In addition the more senior staff, who are most affected by this trend, do not usually fall within maximum working hours legislation and are not paid overtime. The study, which surveyed leisure trends in 18 countries re\u00ad presenting 73% of the world's tourism spending, found very few governments were considering re\u00ad ductions in the length of the working week, increasing paid holiday entitlements or additional public holidays. France, which is introducing the 35 hour working week, is an exception to this. Instead, the countries sur\u00ad veyed are raising the age of retirement and considering in\u00ad creases in contributions to pension funds to contain rising social se\u00ad curity and pension costs. Never\u00ad theless, all the countries in the study, have an ageing population, with an increasing proportion of people over 60 years old. So, for the time being, the boom in the 'grey' travel market is set to con\u00ad tinue. In these circumstances, the trade unions are more concerned about stabilising employment and maintaining income than pressing for more leisure time. The study warns that the impact of these trends on the tourism industry worldwide could be significant. Although demand for holidays is unlikely to weaken, the current trend towards shorter holidays could continue at an even faster rate. Longer holidays, which of\u00ad ten need to be planned well in advance, may become more diffi\u00ad cult to arrange, holidays will be\u00ad come shorter and, for many, more frequent as people find that more intensive breaks, often extended weekends, fit their schedules bet\u00ad ter. This is particularly the case in America and Japan where employ\u00ad ees typically take just ten days leave each year. Citizens of the European Union are more fortu\u00ad nate, with a legal entitlement of a minimum of twenty days, but they too are taking shorter breaks than in the past. New marketing oppor\u00ad tunities are presented by the 'money\u00adrich but time\u00adpoor' travel consumers identified by the study who will seek a portfolio of widely different holidays in easily and quickly accessible destinations. Those who have time constraints rather than money ones will be looking for highly efficient ways of selecting and purchasing holi\u00ad days. These consumers will also expect holidays precisely tailored to their particular interests and requirements. They will not be content to put up with the delays and hassle which are too often associated with travel and, of course, they will expect first class services and facilities at the desti\u00ad nation. Working time is becoming more flexible, working hours are increasingly annualised to meet peaks and troughs in production requirements and more people work on a series of time limited contracts. These changes will re\u00ad duce the traditional seasonal peak\u00ad ing of holiday demand and help reduce the pressure on destina\u00ad tions and transport systems. To rise to these challenges and opportunities, the tourism industry must take a closer look at this changing pattern of leisure time and develop new, exciting products tailored to the needs of even the most time\u00adpressed con\u00ad sumers. Products which they can\u00ad not resist and for which they will be determined to find time de\u00ad spite their heavy schedules. \u25a0 cc. t the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "A n ew EC s t r a t e gy Tourism has long been recognised for its dynamic character and economic potential for boosting trade and opening up regions that lag behind in their development. Over the coming decades, the expected continued expansion, coupled with changing demographics in the main source regions, point to many opportu\u00ad nities to create new niche markets and destina\u00ad tions. With distances shrinking daily, and new information and communication technologies, long-haul travel has never been easier. Tourism is an industry in which the private sector is the major player, small and large firms (Davids and Goliaths) operating side by side both locally and internationally. The European Commission's new tourism strategy seeks to use tourism as a tool for sustainable economic and social development in developing countries, helping them to tackle poverty and integrate into the global economy. Strong potential tourism growth and pri vate sector involvement have strongly influenced the most recent Commission communication 'A European Community strategy to support the development of sustainable tourism in the developing countries' (COM (1998)563 final). By providing an analysis of the specific features of the sector, and proposing an operational strategy for fostering sustain able development, the communication is intended to complement existing EC support for private sector develop ment in the developing countries. At the same time, it seeks to promote cooperation schemes that dovetail better with the EC's development objectives, and to enhance the effectiveness of projects in the light of past experience. Other factors have also been taken into account. Since the Amsterdam Treaty, environmental protection must be integrated in the EU's other policies in order to promote sustainable development. Furthermore, future agreements with development partners will have more emphasis on fostering the emergence of a competitive, employment- generating private sector capable of assisting their shift towards open and competitive markets. The Communication addresses five main areas: \u2022 tourism as a factor of development; \u2022 the challenge posed in trying to achieve sustainability in developing countries; \u2022 past lessons; \u2022 possible future objectives and areas for action; \u2022 proposed basic principles for implementing the strategy and the importance of consistency, coordination and complementarity with other EC policies and strategies. The industry's employment generating capacity across all levels, and multiplier effects in other economic sectors such as transport, construction, food supply and related services, are further reasons why it is being targeted. It also offers scope for the development of many small and medium-sized firms, including those active in rural areas and among social groups facing difficulties in the job market, such as young people, women and less-skilled workers. Challenges Achieving sustainable tourism development is not without challenges. Tourism growth has its own in-built destruction mechanisms which, if left unbridled, can lead to incalculable economic, social and environmental ills. Eco nomic overdependence on this single industry can occur to the detriment of other traditional productive sectors. It can also do irreparable harm to the environment and local societies: burgeoning tourism eats up space and tourist influxes put extra pressure on the natural environment, transforms local cultures and drains often scarce resources. ACP countries have reached different stages in their tourism sectors. Some (notably in the Caribbean), already have mature and fully-fledged tourism industries upon which their economies are highly dependent. They may even have suffered the adverse effects of unplanned tourism growth and have already been obliged to upgrade their product. Others have an emerging industry with steadily increasing tourist flows. Their success will depend on their ability to manage and control this growth. In the third category are countries which may have the potential for developing tourism and already attract a few visitors, but where the conditions do not really exist to enable the sector to take off. Yet, developing countries still share common pro blems. Increased global demand is being matched by an increasing number of destinations and global capacity - so competition is becoming stiffen Those with developed industries have to fight to retain market share by enhancing quality and diversifying products and markets. Emerging and potential destinations must find their own niche by capitalising on their 'uniqueness' while avoiding mistakes made by other destinations. Obstacles to developing competitive tourism sectors are also common - for example, poor infrastructure, communications and human resources, and political or economic instability. Visitors from developed countries, demanding ever-higher quality, compound these problems further. Long-term benefit will only accrue to host nations if they are able to maintain the very elements that attracted tourists in the first place (the natural and built environment, local social fabric, cultural and historical heritage). Thus, there is often a choice to be made between the short-term economic benefits that the industry can provide, and giving due consideration to long-term protection of the environ mental and social assets on which the sector is based. Past lessons The EU has supported tourism in developing countries for some 20 years. While Lom\u00e9 I and II hardly mentioned the subject, Lom\u00e9 III specifically referred to tourism as an integral part of cooperation in trade and services, as part of regional cooperation, in social and cultural cooperation, and in the sectors supported by the European Investment Bank. In Lom\u00e9 IV, Articles 121 and 122 (Chapter 3) are devoted to tourism. Support focuses on four main areas: human resources and institutional development, product development, market development, and research Council resolution I The Commission's Communication has since been backed up by a Council Resolution on Sustainable Tourism In Developing Countries which supports the development of tourism in the context of private sector development. It underlines the role that projects and programmes should make in this field: - maximise tourism's contribution to the overall social and economic development of the country; - minimise existing or potential negative effects of tourism; - contribute to poverty eradication; - aid governments in establishing legal and institutional frameworks capable of supporting tourism initiatives at all levels in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Through the private sector, cooperation should also help promote a growth in overall employment and competitive ness. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "d o s s i er and information. Direct and indirect support has also been given through programmes in related areas such as infra structure, the environment, human resources development, private sector development and health. In practice however, past EC programmes have often been too general, with objectives too narrowly defined (usually 'to increase tourist arrivals'). As a result, promotional activity in source markets has been over emphasised, without sufficient attention given to building environmental and social requirements into the tourism products offered, to strengthen their sustainability. More over, interlocutors chosen in developing projects tended mainly to be public bodies (such as national tourist authorities), without any real interface being created with other stakeholders (local government, civil society or the private sector). Future objectives and action Against this background of experience, opportu nities and challenges, the Commission's strategy for future assistance to developing countries in the field of tourism focuses on achieving sustainable development. Agenda 21, the action programme adopted by the UN's 'Earth Summit' in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 has also influenced this strategy. Three main areas are addressed: \u2022 fostering the sustainable development of tourism; \u2022 helping public authorities in their planning, management and follow-up (supporting the development of the legal and institutional framework, human resource development, safeguarding the public heritage and infrastructure, and information and commercial organisation); \u2022 consolidating the tourist industry in an open and competitive market economy (encouraging cooperation in the private sector and direct support for small and medium sized enterprises - SMEs). Community support for tourism development should be possible for all developing countries benefiting from a cooperation agreement in which the sector is included. Tourism however, is not a panacea. Not all countries or regions have the right potential to develop a viable industry that is both sustainable and competitive. The complex and dynamic nature of tourism, coupled with the different degrees of maturity achieved in the sector by different countries, mean that there are no typical problems or solutions. Thus, the kind and scale of support will vary according to the level of tourism devel opment the country has already achieved, and specific local needs. In more mature destinations, operations focused on specific facets of the tourist product will be used - for example, redefining the current strategy. In countries with emerging tourism, more comprehensive schemes to establish an overall framework for future development will be more appropriate. In all initiatives and at all stages, rigour will be applied, tailored to the complexities of developing tourism, involving stakeholders and encouraging regional coopera tion. Sustaining the social and cultural fabric, as well as the natural and built environment, and promoting competi tiveness and open markets, are seen as guiding principles for developing a viable sector with quality tourism products. Support for the private sector will target two levels: improving the partnership between firms and branches of activity connected with tourism and through cross-disciplin ary measures for SMEs in general. If private sector provision is to flourish, the right administrative framework must be in place - especially as regards legislation and regional planning. Thus, support for governments will focus on establishing a legal and institutional framework, developing human resources and public infrastructure, protecting and developing the natural and cultural heritage, and moder nising methods and instruments for marketing the destina tion. Moreover, tourist authorities in future will not be the only bodies identified as interlocutors. Close consultation will be promoted between existing public and private sector organisations in developing policies and strategies. Co- financing agreements will also be used to instil a stronger sense of 'ownership'. Poor development can impact very negatively on local people. Thus, a partnership involving all stakeholders is required. Partnership embracing the private and public sectors and civil society is seen as necessary to ensure that the needs of the market and the local people are taken into account, along with the special features of the destination. Initiatives involving grass-roots economic and social 'players' may be encouraged, as it is at this level where one finds the greatest exposure to the negative impacts of tourism. With regard to sex tourism involving children, a Community action programme has already been put in place with a two-pronged strategy to reduce demand and attack the sources of supply. Regional cooperation is also seen as beneficial to tourism development. Countries involved in such initiatives can benefit from economies of scale (in fields such as training and information gathering). They can resolve common problems jointly (for example, environmental protection). And they can benefit from the common promotion of particular tourism products. The aim is to get a genuine commitment from public authorities and the industry to pursue viable policies compatible with the required environmental considerations. Tourism-related programmes will encourage initiatives to employ resources sustainably (cutting down on excess consumption and waste, promoting non-polluting forms of energy and transport, conserving natural and cultural diversity). They will also help integrate the sector into overall planning and, where appropriate, support local economies. The strategy aims to achieve consistency, coordina tion and complementarity between community tourism development measures and action in related fields such as the private sector and environmental protection. Working with the EIB and EU Member States, rational tourism development will be used in destination countries to foster general development. MM c.o. The future A debate on 'Tourism and its sustainable development' was held at the 7th session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, meeting in New York. This event brought together all the key stakeholders (donor institutions, local authorities, NGOs trade unions and the tourist industry). A key aim was to look at how the findings of Agenda 21 can be applied to tourism, what has been achieved so far and what has yet to be done. A number of successful EC-supported tourism projects, highlighting the main principles of this new strategy were presented. In the framework of North-South cooperation, environmental protection and sustainable tourism develop ment, two ACP projects were highlighted: the Namibia Tourism Development Programme and the Negril Marine Park, a project developed in Jamaica.

        "The h u m an d i m e n s i on of an e x p a n d i ng sector by Dora Valayer* Nothing seems capable of halting the widespread ad\u00ad vance of tourism in the world economy. While nine of the top ten destination countries are still in the northern hemisphere, more and more southern nations are becoming involved in the sector. Tourism undoubtedly helps certain regions to emerge from underdevelop\u00ad ment and dependence - but at what price? There are four groups of actors involved in tourism: the states in the host regions; the tourist industry; the tourists themselves; and the host populations - which are too often neglected. States define tourism policy and provide the infrastructure ne cessary for its development: airports and motorways, water supplies and development in the host areas. Such projects often require loans, and climatic or political uncertainty may complicate repayment schemes and schedules. When a regime is demo cratic, its priorities include, in prin ciple, the economic and social devel opment of its country's population. Conversely, under dictatorships, the foreign currency earned from tour ism generally serves to strengthen the police and the military. In Myan mar, for example, whole populations have been displaced on account of tourism: women and children are organised into forced-labour bri gades and huge numbers of refu gees live far from their homes in precarious circumstances. The second factor is the tourist industry itself. As with other sectors, it invests, purchases, sells and is subject to the laws of the market, to supply and demand, and to the rules of competition. It fore- * President of Transverses (Association for Reflection, Information and Action on North/South Tourism), 7 rue Heyrault, 92100 Boulogne, France. Fax 01 49 10 90 84. sees, anticipates and reinforces its clients' desires. Thirdly, there are the custo mers, the consumers of tourism products. The bulk of their spend ing, in many cases, is on travel to the place of consumption. Once they have arrived, they may be content with frugal enjoyment of the land scape. They may even shamelessly take advantage of 'the legendary hospitality' of the local population. They spend more as tourists than they would over the rest of the year (accommodation, food, culture). Tourism equates with escape from the constraints of urban life, a break from the daily grind, compensation for the frustrations of the rest of the year. It represents the achievement of access to a dream, to the un known, to 'high-level' cultural con sumption, or indeed the fulfilment of more or less autonomous primi tive desires (sun and heat, pleasure, sex, escapism, achievement, change of scene, experimentation), and of artificially created needs. It is 'idle ness' in a 'charming' setting, where a high level of protection and of expense cover extreme risk. Like Christopher Columbus, who marvelled at the qualities of the local people but obsessively sought gold, the tourist is in search of a good deal, a nice photo. Often, the tourist is just a child - for him, holidays represent Christmas every day, a fact of which local traders are well aware. So the basic tourist market is governed, most of the time, by these three components: the state, the tourist industry and tourists as con sumers. Unrestrained pleasures and quests would be acceptable were it not for the fact that other peoples and societies are involved. Such people are 'at home' and do not understand what is going on. Some times poor, they are, nevertheless, culturally wealthy in terms of their own past and their own civilisation, and merit their own identity. Differ ent to the point of being fascinat ing, their penury and their new dependence makes them, in their turn, 'consumables'. These people in the host country are the fourth and final element in the tourism equation. They are involved at three levels: they are sometimes part of con sumption itself - their rituals, cus toms, costumes and crafts. Certainly, tourism contributes to the survival of customs which are gradually being abandoned, but in order to be preserved, they have to be made more attractive, better adapted to tourism. Interminable traditional dances are shortened to make them more appealing to visitors. Craft articles are mass produced and ritual objects are converted into gadgets. Local people work in tourism The local people also carry out the work of tourism, in the lower echelons of the system, as waiters, kitchen staff, guides, and so on. They then have to adapt to Western ways, to Western notions of time, space and relationships to others, which are foreign to them. The same individual may be torn between an obligation artificially to maintain local customs and an ob ligation to live at the pace of the tourist and of the latter's demands; between, for example, the shanty town where he lives with his family and the luxury of the grand hotel where he works. However, inhabitants in a region cornered by the tourist mar ket have been its occupants for centuries, sometimes millennia, of ten in symbiosis with their land, linked to it in a mysterious and vital way which is incomprehensible to visitors. Although such lands appear suitable, in terms of the first three groups (the state, the tourism in dustry and the tourists themselves), for tourist developments, self-suffi cient local populations will simply be expelled, and will receive very lim ited compensation. The destruction of a series of villages, as took place on certain coasts in India or in the Calabarz\u00f3n region in the Philippines, and in many other places, creates a detrimental and irreversible situa tion. Golf courses are the most insidious. This magnificent pastime, enjoyed over large expanses of land in countries with plentiful rainfall, is prejudicial in the tropics. Villages are displaced and land confiscated, con- the Courier n c 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "d o s s i er siderable water is consumed and there is dangerous use of pesticides. The most vulnerable popula\u00ad tions are the indigenous peoples, the 'threatened civilisations'. In South America and certain parts of Africa and elsewhere, tribes or no\u00ad mads have been deprived of their lands. The displacement is regulated in such a manner that they are no longer able to live according to their ancestral experience of land or water. Generally speaking, inhabi\u00ad tants of host countries in the south\u00ad ern hemisphere are often no more than ill\u00adinformed, unconsulted labourers. When tourists arrive, lack\u00ad ing any kind of reference, such people lose their own cultural, social and politi\u00ad cal references. When a 'virgin' region is coveted by tourism promoters, con\u00ad tracts are signed between the latter and the state. It would be too complicated a task to consult the some\u00ad times illiterate population. Local inhabitants are una\u00ad ware of the fate awaiting them and are unable to prepare for it. This dark picture is not exceptional. Although tourism is now irreversibly expanding in an ever lar\u00ad ger number of regions, could the situation be modified? Could certain harmful trends be re\u00ad versed? The answer is yes, because there are places, and there are local, na\u00ad tional and international bodies, where the situa\u00ad tion is already understood and under examination, where experiments are being carried out and texts proposed. It would be desirable for these to be better coordinated and for all those involved to make a contribution. Such initiatives must not remain on the fringes of the issue. What is needed first is an assessment of such instruments as do exist: key documents such as the Sustainable Tourism Charter, the Manilla Declaration, the forthcom\u00ad ing world code of tourism ethics and the guide for local planners. Con\u00ad sideration of such texts must lead to new practices and new legislation. The aim should not just be the protection of customers, profit for the industry or benefits for the host states \u00ad when the latter have not, in their practices, taken of account of their own population's welfare. Above all, it is essential to involve local people in projects as soon as possible, so that they can become responsible players. It is not enough simply to offer training in tourism trades so that they can become mere labourers. They must no longer be condemned to being tourism's 'flunkies'. They must be Buying souvenirs in Bali The interests of local populations must become the present and heard at the highest decision\u00admaking levels. The media must no longer separate political and human infor\u00ad mation from tourism information, which does not take account of such realities. Childlike potential tourists should be made aware in advance and helped to become responsible tourists. After all, they are often responsible citizens in their own country. This does not mean taking away part of their dream, but rather renewing and preserving it. They have to be made more aware while they are doing their research and when they express their desires, before they choose their holiday. The ECPAT campaign against child prostitution linked with tour\u00ad ism has been creative and effective, but child prostitution is only the most dramatic tip of the iceberg of disorder which is too often created by tourism. Such creativity must manifest itself throughout the tour\u00ad ism sector and throughout the world. It is essential to list, publicise and support often small and struggling, but courageous, travel companies which \u00ad in both the host countries and in those from which tourists originate \u00ad create a kind of tourism which respects local circumstances and the environment. We have to listen to travel agencies prepared to risk convert\u00ad ing this new system of ethics into a sales argu\u00ad ment and to envisage the creation of a tourism watchdog. Tourism education must be given a direction which takes all the above into account and makes its students aware of the is\u00ad sues.

        "W hy NGOs h a ve a s t a ke in t o u r i sm by Patricia Barnett* 'Tourism is the world's largest industry, affecting the lives of millions of people. While it can bring benefits, these are seldom spread evenly. People in many tourist destinations are now counting the cost of development that has failed to put their interests and rights on a par with their visitors. Livelihoods are being lost, religions and cultural traditions debased and environments degraded. ' In order to find constructive responses to these problems. Tourism Concern, a UK-based NGO, was set up in 1989 as a membership network. Its raison d'\u00eatre is to look at the way tourism affects the people and environments in tourism destination areas and campaign for a tourist industry that justly yields benefits which are fairly distrib uted, involves local people in its development and management, and puts long-term social and environmental benefit before short-term gain. In this article. Tourism Concern's Director gives an overview of what sustainable tourism means from an NGO perspective and introduces the idea of 'Fair Trade Tourism'. It takes a while to develop a strong supporter base for NGOs campaigning for issues that are not obviously to do with poverty, health, animal welfare and natural disasters. Raise tourism as a development issue, and talk about how it impacts on people's cultures, environments, economies, and human rights, and even the most committed supporter of environmental and human rights causes would think at least twice before deciding that this could be a problem that needs their support. Taking a holiday has, after all, now become a right for all those in the European Union and not many of us would begin to think that this might exacerbate already difficult and fra gile problems, let alone contribute to the loss of basic rights as outlined in the Declaration of Human Rights. Tourism has an effect on far more than the green environment; it im pacts on people and their environ ments. Very often, these impacts are not obvious or visible. It is because these problems are sometimes so profound that NGOs have become involved. Orga nisations have been set up both in the South (India, Gambia, Thailand, Kenya, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and else where) and in the North (North America, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Nether lands and Australia). Those in the South challenge an industry over which they feel they have no control and in which they seek a voice, while the Northern NGOs are advo cates for those who are currently voiceless - both groups and indivi duals. For ten years, Tourism Con cern in the UK has been challenging the might of the tourism industry rather in the way that David chal lenged Goliath, but now, very im portantly, the whole world has sus tainable tourism on its agenda. It is being discussed at the UN in New York as part of the Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD), the body that was created to follow up the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Perhaps this is the stone that David would have put into his sling. The discussion at the UN does not simply view the move towards sustainable tourism devel opment as an environmental matter, but recognises a very wide range of interlocking issues. Few from the South would argue that the tourism development their countries are en couraging is free of impacts on their cultures and their societies. Even the economic rewards they seek are often lost through leakages. Such leakages are inevitable with larger tourism developments which are generally externally financed and owned, and given food, beverages and facilities are often imported rather than sourced locally. Southern governments will be asking how they can acquire a healthier share of the profits and find more appro priate ways of developing the in dustry. Tourism is a massive export item and subject, as a service, to the GATS agreements. Many countries view it as a relatively inexpensive way of bringing in badly needed foreign exchange and, in any event, such development can often be a * Director Tourism Concern (Web Page: http://www.gn.apc.org/tourismconcern) Tourism Concern: why fair trade in tourism (Taken from the NGO's Internet pages) Fair trade means a better deal for producers in the South - the so-called 'developing nations' - who otherwise suffer because they lack the economic muscle to compete with rich Northern businesses. Existing fair trade schemes and concepts deal mainly with commodities - tangible, physical goods such as coffee. They don't address the different issues of service industries. Yet worldwide, the service sector is outgrowing manufacturing. Tourism (which is really a whole range of different services) is now one of the world's largest industries. We believe that tourism industry practices must be re-examined: tour operators must acknowledge responsibility not just to shareholders and clients, but also to their Southern trading partners. Tourism Concern is working with Southern organisations to ensure that their voice is heard in defining fair trade in tourism. Key issues include prices and working conditions, controlling how a destination is marketed in the North, and transparency. Social auditing: Some progressive businesses now conduct environmental audits. We believe there needs to be a similar system of social auditing that looks at the impact of a project on people and communities. Defining fair trade in tourism: The University of North London, Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) and Tourism Concern are working towards a definition of fair trade in tourism that can be used by both the tourism industry in the North and by organisations in the South. Transparency: Transnational corporations affect millions of people's lives, with little accountability. Transparency means making it easy to obtain information about the activities of these huge and powerful corporations. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 I ",
        "d o s s i er part of structural adjustment plan ning. Through our work, which brings us into contact with many people in destination areas, we know that residents of localities where tourism has arrived from 'out of the blue' often ask why they had no say in such developments that have a major impact on their lives. They also ask why, if forced to accept the new situation, regardless of their opinions, they are not at least getting a fairer share of this seemingly unstoppable industry. They will be interested to know that the CSD is likely to be discussing how local people can be recognised as stakeholders and in volved in the planning processes. This is an integral component of sustainable tourism. There are, of course, count less ways for people with some entrepreneurial energy and capital to find ways of cashing in on tourism. There are also a multitude of jobs available and new employ ment possibilities. But the reality is that most of these jobs are menial, poorly paid, seasonal and not union ised. Few would dispute that, with occasional exceptions, the economic benefits of tourism are rarely chan nelled back into local development. Tourism Concern, and other similar organisations, view tourism as a development issue and argue that it should not be treated as if it were an isolated 'cash crop'. If it is genuinely an appropriate industry to develop in a particular area, it can and should offer excellent op portunities for appropriate and sus tainable development, whether in a poorer Southern country or on the periphery of a wealthy European country. Our interest in Fair Trade stems from our vision of a more just and sustainable form of interna tional tourism. The fair trade move ment has demonstrated that South ern producers can receive a fairer deal through international trade, if certain standards and principles are adhered to. The growth in the market share of products like Cafe Direct 1 in the UK indicate that consumers in the North are also keen to support people-friendly as well as environment-friendly goods. Of course, tourism is a rather more complex product than tea or coffee, but this should not deter us from working towards some answers. Policy considerations need to include stakeholder partnerships, the creation of social, cultural and economic benefits for host destina tions, the integration of tourism into other sectors and policy areas such as agriculture, transport and fish eries, a commitment to transparency, an emphasis on ecological sustain- ability and a respect for human rights. We believe that Fair Trade in tourism must be commercially viable. It should not be seen as a niche product driven solely by social va lues, or be used as a marketing ploy. It should be inherent in any trading process in international tourism, particularly with less developed economies. It may start off with a small market, but it is intended to build up models of good practice 1 Cafe Direct is a small, non-profit making company set up by four organisations in the UK. Equal Exchange, Oxfam Trading, Traid- craft and Twin Trading. The price Cafe Direct pays to coffee growers is always above the world price with a 10% premium for development purposes. There are now producer groups in seven countries - Peru, Dominican Republic.Mexico, Costa Rica, Ni caragua, Uganda and Tanzania, Sales began in 1991. By 1993, products were on sale in Scottish supermarkets where consumer pres sure was strongest. National expansion followed and, in 1994, instant coffee was introduced. The sector now has 3% of the British coffee market. Cafe Direct products carry the Fair Trade mark. Fair trade conference I Over the past two years, a research project involving a partnership between Tourism Concern, the University of North London and Voluntary Service Overseas, has studied the application of fair trade principles to the tourism sector. A conference is being held on June 9 at the University of North London to disseminate the findings of various strands of research to a wider audience, and to draw on the experience of other researchers active in this field. The aim is to gain wider acceptance for fairly traded tourism and identify ways and means to implement such principles through replication of examples of good prac tice, indicators and codes of practice. The one-day conference is for the travel and tourism industry, develop ment, conservation and social welfare NGOs and those interested in tourism and fair trade as a central component of sustainable development.

The EU's Development Edu cation department and the British Department for International Devel opment (DFID) are now supporting us in our work to establish an international network of NGOs, local groups, multinational organisations, the private sector and UN agencies, which will help not only to develop and refine the concepts of fairly traded tourism, but to put these on the agenda of international trade organisations and into the public arena. In our work, we have to ensure that we do not opt simply for identifying how smaller, commu nity-run projects can be fairly traded, but actually seek to identify how larger systems might be devel oped in a fairer, more just and participatory way.

        "'Made by Tourism' 'Made by Tourism', is an international quality label, that Dr Ralf Corsten, Chairman of the Executive Board of TUI (Touristik Union International), would like to see become the leitmotif for sustainable tourism development across the whole sector. Reconciling t he massive growth in holiday travel (predicted by bodies such as the World Tourism Organisation) and the in dustry's potential for creat ing jobs and economic de velopment on the one hand, with the challenges and threats this may pose for the environments of tourism destinations (often in developing countries) on the other, was the central theme of the 8th annual 'TUI Environmental Forum', staged during the recent tourism trade fair in Berlin. Based in Germany, Europe's largest source tourist market, the TUI group is a market leader. It publishes 30 million brochures an nually and caters for some five million tourists travelling to desti nations in more than 150 holiday regions. Keen to maintain its pole position, TUI has long been aware that the environment is the key asset upon which their entire economic operation is based. It is the essential element for good vacations and tourist satisfaction. No other branch of the global economy is so keenly dependent on an intact environment (unspoilt nature, clean water and beaches, pure air) undamaged by the ra vages of industry and mass trans port. Recognising that ecological management is a form of value or asset management, TUI was among the first operators to es tablish a corporate department dedicated to environmental issues. This department reports direct to the executive board - an indica tion of the priority given to the issue. Over the last decade, envir onmental know-how has been systematically developed and ap plied to all stages of product development: planning, pro gramme design, development, ho tel contracting and catalogue in formation. The objective has con sistently been to reduce to a minimum the ecological impacts arising from tourism. TUI sets eco logical quality targets for their holiday hotels and tourist destina tions. Their environmental check lists, evaluations and practical pre sentations have become interna tionally renowned. Ecological quality develop ment has since been enthusiasti cally taken up by others in the sector, and internationally recog nised standards have indeed been established. In an ever-more com petitive field, where customers no longer want just sun, sea and sand but also security, sanitation and satisfaction, the pressure is on operators, hoteliers and carriers to respond. The challenge for them is to ensure that the attri butes of performance, quality and eco-efficiency are linked to their own brand names. As a market leader, TUI takes its global role seriously. In addition to addressing 'green' is sues, it has turned its attention to other areas. In 1998, working with EU institutions, Dr Corsten chaired a high-level group to examine how tourism can contribute more to growth, stability and employ ment in Europe. 'Natural allies' According to Dr Corsten: 'An intact environment and tour ism are natural allies. And in the long-term, the growth forecasts and increased employment in the industry will only be realised if resources are used sustainably.' He adds: 'Fishermen can make a much better living by taking tourists on boat trips to watch whales than they ever could by hunting them.' TUI's Environmental Forum focused on the social as well as the ecological challenges of tourism. The aim was to have a dialogue with destination representatives, and national and international experts to assess how balance can be achieved between economic success, social responsibility and environmental conservation. What clearly came out of the Forum was that destinations/ holiday resorts are getting left behind. These places bear the brunt of tourism's negative im pacts. In these circumstances, they should be getting a higher propor tion of the positive benefits. In a globalised economy, expectations of what a growing tourist industry can deliver are increasing. People see it, among other things, as a source of economic development, jobs, innovation and social moder nisation. Yet there is little evidence to suggest that tourism has helped close the widening economic gulf between North and South. In the longer term, this situation threa tens both the global environment and international'tourism itself. Increasingly, the onus is being put on big concerns like TUI to shoulder more responsibility for ensuring a more equitable distribution of the benefits. Forum participants recognised this as a key challenge of sustainable devel opment. Social standards and ac countability, it was felt, should become integral to future quality standards in the same way that ecological standards have done. Aware that this issue has still to be addressed by tour com panies, TUI expressed willingness to work with the UN Environment Programme to support a 'Joint Tour Operators Initiative'. This would involve holiday companies committing themselves to con crete, binding measures in favour of ecological and social sustain- ability. Sustainable tourism devel opment can only be achieved collectively, and must be built on strong and credible 'ecological alliances' involving the industry, public institutions and partners in host destinations. Solar energy, solidarity and sustainability may one day replace sun, sea and sand, as tourism's key words - but there is still a long way to go. TUI's commitment to making 'Made by Tourism' an international quality label for sustainable development is just the beginning. M co. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "'Once in A f r i c a, a l w a ys in A f r i c a' Does Africa ignore its most important markets? According to the experts attending the Africa Forum in Berlin, despite its obvious wealth of flora, fauna, natural and cultural heritage, the continent still has far to go in promoting and marketing its riches in the major source markets. In 1998, World Tourism Organisation figures showed that Africa's respectable growth rates (an 8.2% increase in interna\u00ad tional tourist arrivals and a 10.3% increase in tourism receipts) belie the fact that, compared to the rest of the world, demand on the continent remains weak. Africa only attracted 4% of the 626 million international tourist 'arrivals' recorded in 1998 and received just 2.1% of the $445 billion spent on tourism globally. A poor image, ill\u00ad conceived marketing plans, poor communication strate\u00ad gies, insufficiently devel\u00ad oped private/public sector partnerships and a lack of funding for promotion were some of the causes listed by experts for Africa's weak perfor\u00ad mance. Prohibitively expensive air\u00ad fares and insufficient air routes further reduce competitiveness. However, not all the blame can be laid at Africa's door. Negative media \u00a1mages in the developed world still portray Africa as the 'Dark Continent' \u00ad war\u00adtorn, and famine ridden. These perceptions neutralise many of the positive \u00a1mages promoted at great expense by African governments. Michael Afedi Gizo, Ghana's Tourism Min\u00ad ister summed up the problem. 'When a crisis hits one African country, the media implies that all of Africa is affected. Yet this is not the case in Europe. Berlin is not considered in the same con\u00ad text as Kosovo despite the rela\u00ad tively small distance between them.' Despite the Forum's down\u00ad beat tone, Africa does have success stories. Zimbabwe, which attracts a million visitors annually, is the second most visited country after South Africa. Givemor Chidzidzi (Director, Continental Europe) and Rose Mukogo of the Zimbabwe Tourist Authority (ZTA \u00ad Webpage http:llwww.tourismzimbabwe.\u00ad co.zw) gave us some insights into that country's marketing activities. The basic problem, we were told, was not a lack of enthusiasm but how to maximise the benefits given limited re\u00ad sources. The key, it seems is an effective public/private sector part\u00ad nership. 'Neither party can do it alone'. The ZTA promotes destina\u00ad tions and facilitates tourism devel\u00ad opment but does not actually sell anything. The private sector has the products to sell but cannot do this in the absence of awareness about the destination. According to Ms Mukogo, tourism is now clearly recognised in Zimbabwe as a major engine for economic development. 'The large hotel chains aside, most of our tourism operators are locals thus reducing leakage' (the phenomen\u00ad on where tourism receipts do not remain in the country). 'In terms of visitors, we do not want to pro\u00ad mote mass tourism, given the fragility of our resources. Zim\u00ad babwe is not closed to any visitor, but the ideal would be to attract a few high\u00adspending tourists taking long holidays. Unfortunately, it is usually the high spenders who have the least time.' Mr Chidzidzi noted that to market Zimbabwe's attractions, the right message needed to be communicated to the various cus\u00ad tomers. The private sector has to share in this,' he stressed. 'It is they who provide the services and mo\u00ad bilise the tourists. Jointly we com\u00ad municate to the public what visi\u00ad tors can expect in Zimbabwe.' Trade fairs are a focal point. Various contacts are possible at such events: with potential visitors who can learn about the destina\u00ad tion; with tour operators who are looking for tangible products to sell as packages; and with the media. He added that the Internet was increasingly becoming an in\u00ad valuable tool. An example of successful marketing. The Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe's largest single tourist attraction... are actually in Zambia Zimbabwe's unique selling points (known as USP in the trade) cater to various tastes according to Mr Chidzidzi. 'Victoria Falls and wildlife are our top attractions. 13% of the country is devoted to national parks and reserves. Zim\u00ad babwe also has a very good track record for wildlife conservation thanks partly to our highly trained guides, who are reputedly the best in Africa. Zimbabweans themselves are another important element.' He pointed out that it would be futile to focus on tourism if the host population was hostile. Other factors mentioned were easy ac\u00ad cessibility, the country's level of development and infrastructure, 'low crime rates' and its commu\u00ad nications network. These, we were informed, come as a 'a pleasant surprise' for visitors. 'Indeed, 50% of our tourists are repeat visitors \u00ad which bears out the saying \"Once in Africa, always in Africa'\". Tourism promotion is an ongoing and long\u00adterm activity. A lot has been done through the Regional Tourism Organisation for Southern Africa (RETOSA) to cre\u00ad ate a perception of the region as a single destination. Visitors to Zim\u00ad babwe are encouraged also to visit other SADC states: (such as Bots\u00ad wana, Malawi, South Africa or Namibia). 'While we may all be competing for tourists today, there are long\u00adterm gains in this ap\u00ad proach,' insisted Ms Mukogo. This year's visitor to Botswana may come back to the region in a couple of years to visit Zimbabwe.' She also pointed out that tourism products tend not to be substitu\u00ad table.

        "Hunters - ' t he u l t i m a te e c o t o u r i s t s '? by Emanuel Koro, Juan Ovejero and Julian Sturgeon* For many, the idea of going to Africa to kill wildlife for sport is shocking. Hunting is increas ingly viewed as 'politically-incorrect'. The authors of this article, however, argue that sport hunting can be good for conservation and represents a valid form of sustainable tourism. They also underline the importance of local community involvement in tourism ventures in Southern Africa. The Ecotourism Society defines eco- tourism as 'tourism that conserves the natural environment and wellbeing of local people through responsible travel'. It therefore has two substantive elements, which differentiate it from regular tourism - conservation of the environment and benefits to local people. In living up to these ideals, ecotourism must: - create jobs and training opportunities for local residents; - stimulate local economies directly through the influx of tourism revenues (this should have a multi plier effect, boosting secondary activities such as food supply, transport and accommodation, and under pinning informal, traditional activities, such as the production of local arts and crafts); - promote awareness of the environment and conservation in the host communities; - bring in significant amounts of foreign currency; Ecotourism as a development tool in Southern Africa Southern Africa is not alien to the ecotourism debate. Recently, great emphasis has been placed on the role that 'community ecotourism' can play in the region's social and economic development, as well as in helping to conserve biological diversity. Interna tional tourism trends indicate that today's traveller wants a more enriching experience than that pro vided by the conventional 'sun and sea' vacation. Southern Africa is well placed to take advantage of this trend. There are a great many opportunities for communities to engage in tourism, given their wild life resources, attractive landscapes and cultural heritage. There is also an increasing recognition of people's rights to benefit from their resources and to develop enterprise opportunities. Recognising such potential, on behalf of the SADC Natural Resource Management Programme Consortium, the Africa Resources Trust (ART) con vened a workshop on community tourism in Wind hoek, Namibia in January. The event attracted 50 participants from eight SADC countries, including * Africa Resources Trust. NGO based in Harare whose objective is rural development through the sustainable use of natural resources. European Liaison office, Rue Jules Lejeune 32, 1050 Brussels. traditional leaders, elected community representa tives, NGOs, community-based organisations (CBOs), academics, wildlife authorities, practitioners, senior government officials and the private sector. The main recommendations focused on: - better research and planning of projects including community involvement and awareness; - facilitating communities' access to services such as feasibility studies and planning, institution building, negotiation, contracting and management of small businesses; - more attention for issues of tenure over land and resources (often, national policies do not support community efforts); - facilitating joint ventures between communities and the private sector; - developing practical marketing policies. In order to guarantee a fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from the sustainable use of natural resources, including ecotourism, it was recognised that the private sector and NGOs should try to foster partnerships between marginalised rural communities and the private sector in environment and development programmes. For. ecotourism to contribute successfully to sustainable rural development, it must be well regulated and managed by the local communities receiving direct benefits from tourists. With its unique landscapes and abundant wildlife resources, Southern Africa is determined to use its natural resources as an engine to promote rural development. This means going further than simply creating 'national parks'. Rural communities need the means to develop capacity so that nature-based tourism schemes can act as a catalyst for sustainable rural development on communal lands. It is true that many communal areas, due to their remoteness and inaccessibility, are not suitable for game viewing. Moreover, rural commu nities often lack the funds to provide the high quality infrastructure demanded by the luxury tourism sector. Constraints on tourism development in communal areas include a lack of secure land tenure and the prohibitive cost of establishing the basic infrastruc ture required for tourism (roads, accommodation and telecommunications). This means that sound socio economic and environmental assessments, as well as private sector and donor assistance, are much needed. Such assessments should also consider the structural problems associated with ecotourism, including finan cial 'leakage' (the amount of tourism revenue that does not stay in the host country), the depletion of natural resources and soil erosion due to over- utilisation of parks. Ecotourism options Ecotourism has proved to be an important means for local communities to capture the economic value of their natural resources. Photo-tourism, often the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 fl ",
        "d o s s i er classified under this heading, is one of the fastest growing 'industries' in Southern Africa, as elsewhere on the continent. But this is not a panacea. Nature\u00ad based tourism initiatives in the region have evolved over the years, and have diversified to include non\u00ad consumptive forms of tourism (such as photo\u00adsafaris) and consumptive forms like sport hunting. The physical setting is all\u00adimportant in the tourist market, which puts a premium on scenic beauty and abundance of wildlife. There are many such places in Southern Africa, but much of the wildlife habitat consists of miles and miles of less scenic woodland or semi\u00adarid savannah. Photo\u00adtour\u00ad ism, also requires infrastructure (transport and com\u00ad munications) and we need to recognise that it can impact negatively on rural communities. What is marketed is an idyllic Africa which exists only in brochures. Tourism can leave a large cultural foot\u00ad print. On the other hand, consumptive forms of tourism, such as recreational or sport hunting, can be a high\u00advalue, low impact tool that directly empowers and enriches rural communities. Safari operators and their clients tend to take risks, and are prepared to venture to places most photo\u00adtourists would avoid. In many of these areas, consumptive tourism schemes can have a real economic impact. Not surprisingly, in Southern Africa, sport hunters are now being hailed as 'the ultimate ecotourists'. Recent studies report that over 90% of income earned by rural communities from wildlife comes from foreign trophy hunters who are there to hunt elephants, buffaloes or lions. Hunters tend not to demand high standards of accommodation or transport, and usually travel in smaller groups. They also pay higher fees, which can be used to fund local development projects. In addition to contributing financially to rural develop\u00ad ment, hunting has added benefits for conservation. For most rural Africans, there is little incentive to preserve wildlife. Large animals like buffaloes, ele\u00ad phants and lions prey on their livestock; trample their crops; pose a serious threat to their livelihoods and sometimes threaten their lives. However, given a steady income from trophy hunting, they have the incentive to conserve the natural ecosystems that make wildlife a competitive form of land use. Many community\u00adbased natural conservation and development programmes in Southern Africa are already marketing eco\u00adtourism. Pioneered first by Zimbabwe, with its Campfire (Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources), a programme that combines sport hunting with photo\u00adsafaris, other countries have followed. In Botswana, communities have formed trusts, such as the Chobe Enclave Conservation Trust, established in 1992. By 1997, revenue from sport hunting and tourist campsites in this area reached $150,000. 85% of the money was reinvested in other income\u00ad generating activities. In Namibia, many local commu\u00ad nities are starting to involve themselves in tourism through the establishment of campsites. The current growth trend, plus recent research, indicates that many more communities are interested in setting up tourism enterprises but do not fully understand how to go about it. In response to the growing needs of community\u00adbased tourism operations, the Namibian Sport hunters in the Caprivi district of Namibia. Fees can be used to fund local development projects. Community\u00adBased Tourism Association was officially launched in October 1995. In the western province of Mozambique, wedged between the Cabora Basa Dam and Zimbabwe, the 'Tchumo Tchato' Community Programme is having a profound impact. In Zambia, the ADMADE and Luangwa Integrated Resource Development programmes are now consolidating, while in South Africa, a traditional eco\u00adtourism destination, community\u00adbased schemes are mush\u00ad rooming, especially in Kwazulu\u00adNatal and the North\u00ad ern Province. The way forward To realise the full potential of ecotourism as a tool for sustainable development, several important steps should be considered: \u00ad land tenure and natural resource\u00aduse rights must be restored to local communities; \u00ad local communities must be encouraged to partici\u00ad pate in designing ecotourism management plans in their regions (this entails training in environmental management, tourism and sustainable development); \u00ad international guidelines for ecotourism must be developed and adhered to; \u00ad safari hunting must be recognised as a legitimate form of ecotourism. As regards specific ecotourism projects, it is essential that tour operators, lodge and hotel owners, and local communities give primacy to the sustainable aspect of the operation. Degradation of the resource beyond certain limits should result in penalties. Legislation or by\u00adlaws to protect natural resources may be necessary in such a context and local authorities should have an important role here. A government objective should be to prolong the high\u00adpaying/low\u00advolume phase of ecotourism. The establishment and enforcement of high standards can be used to achieve this. Since joint ventures between operators and communities will almost certainly be the most common form of management, there should be some basic guidelines drawn up for such ventures. Profit margins also need to be sustainable, and where there is a risk that this will not be the case, the project should be scaled down. Local participation poses complex questions. Communities should be clearly identified, with their legal access to the resource recognised, and there should be a fair distribution of the revenues. Schemes should include a capacity building element for local people with the latter being given priority for jobs. Finally, the role of local authorities is crucial. They need to be given regulatory and monitoring powers. \u25a01 E.K., J.O. & J.S. 1 the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",

Since the begin ning of 1995, the World Wide Web has emerged as the fastest grow ing area of the Internet, enabling the distribution of multimedia in formation. As textual data, gra phics, pictures, video, and sounds became easily accessible, it rapidly became the flagship of the IT revolution providing an innovative platform for the efficient, real and timely exchange of ideas and products. Consequently, there have been unprecedented and un foreseen ramifications prophesied by futurists and the media about the future of marketing, consumer behaviour and even societies. Changes in tourism due to information technology Tourism has inevitably been influenced by the restructur ing experienced in business as a result of the technological revolu tion. Information is the travel industry's life-blood. Therefore, as we approach the 21st century, effective use of technology is fundamental to the tourism sector. By enabling efficient cooperation and offering tools for real globa lisation, the IT revolution has pro found implications for the man agement of the industry. There are few other economic activities where the generation, gathering, processing, application and com munication of information is so important for day-to-day opera tions. Hence, with the rapid devel opment of both tourism supply and demand, and the increasingly important role of data in tourism marketing, distribution, promotion and coordination, IT has become the industry's key partner.

However, it is recognised that the information currently available on the Internet is still chaotic, mainly due to its imma turity and the lack of any type of standardisation.

Systems and networking Computerised networks and electronic distribution have spearheaded the dramatic structu ral changes taking place in the tourism industry. Indeed they are central to the distribution mix and strategy (i.e. how tourism services and products are requested by and reach the client). Computer Reser vation Systems (CRS) and the Inter net are regarded as largely respon sible for transforming travel mar keting and distribution systems. The rapid growth of both demand and supply in recent decades gave rise to the need for powerful computerised systems capable of managing the industry. While the airlines were the pioneers of this technology, international hotel chains and tour operators, realis ing their potential, quickly fol lowed by developing their own centralised reservation systems. Thus, the need for IT has been generated by both the demand and supply, as well as by the expansion of the tourism industry in recent decades. On the demand side, the number of travellers has grown Example of a webpage showing tourist facilities available in Namibia. By clicking on one of the underlined texts, potential tourists with Internet access anywhere in the world can find out about the facilities available in the country rapidly. The result has been a huge increase in the traffic of tourism- related transactions and processes. This, in turn, has propelled the use of powerful ITs and other systems. ITs satisfy the consumer need for easy access to transparent and easily comparable information on a wide variety of destination choices, holiday packages, travel, lodging and leisure services, prices and the availability of services. They also provide immediate con firmation and speedy documenta tion of reservations providing more flexibility and enabling pro spective travellers to book at the 'last minute'. Moreover, improved access to information on all as pects of tourist activities has pro vided the framework for offering personalised services at price levels comparable to those of standard packages. Increasingly, tourists' sa tisfaction depends on the accuracy and relevance of tourism informa tion as well as on promptness in responding to requests. Tourism suppliers use ITs to manage their inventory and dis tribute their capacity. ITs have facilitated and managed the bold global expansion of tourism enter prises and destinations. It can be characterised as the 'circulatory system' of the tourism product, its enable providers to control, promote and sell their products globally, while assisting them to increase their occupancy/load fac tor levels and reduce the effects of seasonality. By enhancing numer ous business functions, the tech nology contributes to their profit ability and long term prosperity. In addition, ITs often charge compe titive commission rates in compar ison with other distribution op tions, while enabling flexible pri cing and capacity alterations - designed to adjust supply to fluc tuations in demand. They also reduce communication costs (inter national e-mail costs far less than an international fax), while provid ing invaluable managerial infor mation on tourism demand pat terns or competitors' position. The development of the Internet has enabled the distribution of multi media information through user- friendly interfaces and, conse quently, made information held in CRSs much more accessible for both the industry and individuals. In short, there has been a revolu tion in the collection and assess ment of information on the de mand and the supply side of tourism. Information technologies for small and medium tourism enterprises Similarly, a wide range of opportunities and challenges are emerging for smaller and medium- sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs) and destinations. The vast majority of tourism suppliers are small and they face enormous difficulties marketing their products globally and competing with larger coun terparts. Multinational organisa tions took advantage of the emer gent technologies earlier than smaller firms to expand their op erations globally. Some SMTEs were absorbed by larger organisa tions while others were obliged to enter franchising agreements with consortia to gain visibility in the marketplace. However, the devel- the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "d o s s i er opment of the Internet has em\u00ad powered even tiny tourism orga\u00ad nisations and destinations, giving them representation in the elec\u00ad tronic marketplace and the ability to network with consumers and partners alike. ITs facilitate the amalgamation of independently produced products and thus en\u00ad able the delivery of seamless tour\u00ad ism experiences by networks of small providers. Innovative entre\u00ad preneurs who appreciate the power of th\u00e9 new media and design their presence accordingly in the electronic marketplace will gain benefits. They can also achieve competitive advantages by positioning themselves as niche operators offering unique and authentic products. Cooperating, rather than competing, with other local entrepreneurs will enable them to develop their virtual size and compete on an equal footing with some of their larger compe\u00ad titors. IT for the sustainable management and marketing of tourism destinations One of the latest IT devel\u00ad opments in the tourism industry is the proliferation of destination\u00ad oriented systems. Destinations are recognised as 'the raison d'\u00eatre' for tourism' and as amalgams of resources, products, facilities and services comprising the 'total tour\u00ad ism product' or the 'travel experi\u00ad ence'. Destination Management Systems (DMSs) provide complete and up\u00adto\u00addate information for a particular destination and, at the same time, facilitate the reserva\u00ad tion of local tourism products. These complete databases ensure that smaller establishments, as op\u00ad posed to international hotel chains and other land services associated with travel are included. DMSs are a strategic management tool which enable enterprises at the micro level and destinations at the macro level to enhance their competitiveness and economic benefits by managing both tour\u00ad ism demand and supply. At the destination level, maximised use of tourist facilities and increased per capita expenditure are vital for the local economy, as they determine both public and private sector income, employment, multiplier effects and foreign currency bene\u00ad fits. DMSs can also be used to enhance the promotional and dis\u00ad tributional mix of destinations by disseminating information on at\u00ad tractions, activities, local festivities and events, while at the same time facilitating reservations and sales. The concept of Destination Integrated Computer Information Reservation Management Systems (DICIRMSs) takes the DMS idea a step forward and proposes an integrated strategic tool for the planning, management and mar\u00ad keting of destinations. This strate\u00ad gic tool will enable SMTEs and peripheral destinations to enhance their competitiveness and boost their profitability. The ultimate aims for DICIRMSs are threefold: optimisation of benefits emerging from tourism; satisfying the vary\u00ad ing needs of new, experienced, sophisticated or demanding tour\u00ad ists; and the enhanced prosperity of the host destinations and socie\u00ad ties. DICIRMSs can assist destina\u00ad tions to achieve competitive ad\u00ad vantages by enabling product dif\u00ad ferentiation and customisation to satisfy consumer needs. They can also support cost competitive ad\u00ad vantages by restructuring the com\u00ad munication and promotion pro\u00ad cesses as well as the information\u00ad seeking and reservation functions, enhancing efficiency and minimis\u00ad ing costs and time required to perform these actions. As far as economic benefits are concerned, DICIRMSs provide a key informa\u00ad tion\u00adsharing platform permitting tourism firms to integrate diagon\u00ad ally at the destination level. In other words, they enable firms performing complementary func\u00ad tions to link up. This leads to cost reductions through 'economies of scope' (the lower costs associated with the joint provision of pro\u00ad ducts or services), synergies (the benefits accruing to the manage\u00ad ment, operation and organisation of interrelated activities, where each activity can generate benefits that reinforce the others) and system gains (the benefits or economies derived from linkages between different activities \u00ad for example, the use of a common database for the design, manage\u00ad ment, production, marketing and distribution of tourism products). Moreover, they assist firms to get closer to their consumers by cater\u00ad ing to their particular needs. Dl\u00ad CIRMS reduce the role of the 'middle\u00adman' and empower the actual tourism providers in the dealings that they still have with intermediaries (such as travel agents or tour operators). In this sense, DICIRMSs sti\u00ad mulate tourism activity and en\u00ad hance the travel experience, at\u00ad tracting valuable tourism expendi\u00ad t u re in order to maximise economic benefits and contribute to the sustainable development of destinations in the long term. Thus, the development of informa\u00ad tion technology and the Internet in particular, can serve to empow\u00ad er the marketing and communica\u00ad tion functions of remote, periph\u00ad eral and insular destinations as well as small and medium sized tourism enterprises. It can provide them with a way of communicat\u00ad ing directly with prospective cli\u00ad ents and of differentiating their product according to their custo\u00ad mers' needs. Information technol\u00ad ogy also introduces several new tools for managing and redevelop\u00ad ing economic, socio\u00adcultural and environmental resources, and hence can contribute to the sus\u00ad tainable development of regions. It is increasingly evident that the competitiveness and prosperity of both enterprises and destinations in the new millennium will depend on the degree to which these new strategic tools provided by the information technology revolution are used innovatively. \u0392 D.B. the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "Partnerships f or s u s t a i n a b le t o u r i sm The perspective of t he International Hotel and Restaurant Association (IH&RA) by Kenneth F. Hine* Today's hotel experience is not what it used to be: fresh towels daily only if requested, recycling of 'grey water' from baths, showers and washing machines, solar\u00adheated water and energy\u00adsaving key cards which automatically turn off the lights when the guest leaves the room. It is probably safe to say that no industry has a greater stake in safeguarding environmental resources than travel and tourism. A well\u00adpreserved environment is both critical to the quality of life in general and to the quality of the travel experience in particular. At the beginning of the decade, most I hotels were unfamiliar with the benefits and principles of sound environmental management. Now, thanks to the efforts of organisations such I as IH&RA, the International Hotels Environment ! Initiative (IHEI), the United Nations Environment 5 Programme/Industry and Environment (UNEP\u00adIE), the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) \u00ad and the pioneering efforts of a core number of hotels \u00ad the greening of our industry is well underway. The message to hotels is two\u00adpronged: not only do green operations ensure an attractive, sustainable environment and the future of the local community, they also make sound business sense. The IH&RA actively promotes environmental awareness and industry self\u00ad regulation, encouraging voluntary initiatives by hotels and restaurants worldwide. As a result, hoteliers across the globe are now increasingly aware of the bottom line benefits to be gained by conserving and recycling resources. The IH&RA's annual Environmental Award pro\u00ad gramme, sponsored by American Express, was launched in 1990 to acknowledge outstanding examples of leader\u00ad ship by hospitality professionals in planning and im\u00ad plementing environmental actions. Over the years, the award has attracted more than 280 applications from hotels and hoteliers all around the world. All demon\u00ad strate a laudable degree of personal and corporate commitment to the environment. In 1998, the IH&RA's 'Green Hotelier and Restaurateur of the Year' award was themed to coincide with the 'Year of the Ocean'. For the first time, special emphasis was placed on the industry's efforts to reduce water consumption, recycle and re\u00aduse water and diversify the 'energy mix' through use of renewable energy sources. The award scheme has identified many innova\u00ad tive and imaginative ideas for monitoring and control\u00ad ling the environmental impact of hotel operations. In Nairobi, the Inter\u00adContinental re\u00adused the condenser from discarded liquid chillers to install a flash steam heat exchange unit. The policy of Hotel Mocking Bird Hill in Jamaica is to employ local resources to the maximum, purchasing locally\u00admade furniture and food. In Hong Kong, Hotel Nikko installed a calibrated water system controlling the flow and temperature balance of each tap or shower. The roof of the Inter\u00adContinental in Sydney has been converted into a nursery to propagate seedlings for community tree planting, while Canadian Pacific Hotels has launched a programme aimed at adopting endangered Beluga whales in the St Lawrence seaway. This is all highly encouraging, but much remains to be done. Hoteliers still face many challenges, includ\u00ad ing greater awareness of siting and design issues, the need for environmental impact assessments and audits, improved integration of green programmes into day\u00adto\u00ad day operations, better monitoring procedures, and increased communication of environmental performance to guests and other stakeholders. The hospitality sector has enormous potential to bring about more sustainable forms of development. A sign of the increasing recognition of tourism's impor\u00ad tance was the UN Commission on Sustainable Develop\u00ad ment's decision to focus on this sector for the first time, at its seventh session in New York in April 1999. IH&RA, with the WTTC, played a key role in organising business and industry participation in th\u00e8 associated two\u00adday Multi\u00adStakeholder Dialogue which brought together representatives of trade unions, local initiatives and NGOs as well as UN member states. A business and industry paper on the four themes of the Dialogue was circulated prior to the meeting and is available on the Internet at the following address: www.un.org/esa/sustdev/report99/bakdoc99.htm It describes industry initiatives, identifies pro\u00ad blem areas and proposes solutions as well as agents and partnerships for change. The four themes are: Industry Initiatives for Sustainable Tourism; Influencing Consumer Behaviour to Promote Sustainable Tourism; Promoting Broad\u00adbased Sustainable Development through Tourism while safeguarding the Integrity of Local Culture, and Protecting the Environment. WTTC and IH&RA pressed at the meeting for a genuine 21st century public/private and voluntary sector partnership. This is the thrust of Agenda 21 for Travel & Tourism, drawn up in 1992 by WTTC with the World Tourism Organisation (WTO) and the Earth Council. This action plan for all enterprises \u00ad from the smallest to the largest \u00ad and for all levels of government, is also a plan for partnership, voluntary initiatives, fair regulation where needed and, above all, local implementation. It is worth noting that tourism is the only industry to have applied Agenda 21 directly to itself. \u25a0\u25a0 K.F.H. Director General, CEO, International Hotel & Restaurant Associa\u00ad tion.

        "The G e n e r al A g r e e m e nt on Trade in Services by Dale B. Honeck* The author believes that the GATS, although containing no provisions explicitly promoting sustainable development, is perfectly compatible with national policies in this regard and is relevant to the tourism debate. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is one of the major achieve ments of the Uruguay Round negotiations, together with the creation of the World Trade Organisation itself. For the first time, services trade was brought under legally binding multilateral rules (extensive information about the WTO, the GATS and the other Uruguay Round trade agreements is available on the W T O / O MC I n t e r n et site at http:// uvivirv.irvto.org). Despite an initial reluctance to permit services negotiations to be included in the Uruguay Round, developing countries were subsequently fully involved in the creation of the GATS. They also participated actively in the negotiation of market access and national treatment commitments in services, as recorded in their GATS schedules. Already, there is 100% developing country participation in the GATS, due to the requirement that all WTO Members must have a GATS schedule. Flexibility has been shown by allowing developing countries to open fewer sectors, liberalise fewer types of transactions, and progressively extend market access in line with their development situation. Tourism is the services sector with the highest number of GATS commitments, due to its popularity with developing countries. In a few cases, this was the only sector in which countries made commitments. The benefits for developing countries of making GATS commitments in tourism extend far beyond simply satisfying the demands of trading partners. As explained below, the transparency and predictability of trade policies are also important factors. In this regard, the upcoming round of services negotiations, mandated to begin in January 2000, presents new opportunities for developing countries. Contents of GATS schedules The legally binding commitments made by a country in its GATS schedule are organised by the services sector concerned, the means by which the service is supplied, and the type of measure. The WTO Services Sectoral Classification List is divided into 12 main categories, with Tourism and Travel Related Services as category 9. The GATS recognises four means by which services can be traded: cross-border supply (e.g. * Member of the WTO Secretariat since 1992, and a Counsellor in the Trade in Services Division since June 1997. The views expressed in this article are those of the author, and not necessarily those of the WTO or its Members. computer reservation services); consumption abroad (e.g. tourists travelling overseas); commercial pre sence (typically foreign direct investment); and the presence of natural persons (i.e. individual service providers). Each of these potential modes of supply must be addressed when making services commit ments. In addition, measures affecting services are considered to be one of three types: market access (i.e. conditions under which market entry is per mitted); national treatment (treatment vis-\u00e0-vis do mestic services suppliers); or 'other'. In its GATS schedule, a country indicates exactly for which services, and for which modes of supply it wishes to make commitments. Also carefully specified are the level of market access (e.g. number of foreign suppliers and scale of permitted activity) and national treatment (e.g. access to domestic subsidies not allowed for foreign suppliers) a country agrees to provide. GATS commitments are expected to be further liberalised over time, and are subject to negotiation with trading partners. Existing tourism commitments As part of the information exchange activities in preparation for the next round of services negotiations, the WTO Secretariat prepared 20 back ground papers in 1998 on specific services sectors, including tourism (the papers are publicly available on the WTO website in English, French and Spanish). The background papers provide a description of the sector, and summarise its economic importance, the regulatory structure, relevant trade restrictions and existing GATS commitments. For tourism services, the Secretariat paper (written by the author) indicates that, as of Septem ber 1998, 112 WTO members have made commit ments in tourism under the GATS. This level is greater than for any other services sector, and indicates the desire of most members to expand tourism and increase inward FDI as part of their efforts to promote economic growth. In regard to the level of market access and national treatment provided within member sche dules, commitments by mode of supply vary widely for the tourism sector. The number of commitments made also varies widely by sub-sector. Hotels and restaurants (sub-sector A) shows the greatest number, with 112 members (i.e. all) making commitments. This is followed in order by travel agencies and tour operators services with 89 commitments, tourist guide services with 54, and 'other' with only 13 commit ments. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",

Among the most common restrictions appear\u00ad ing in schedules, the cross\u00adborder supply of hotel and restaurant services is often indicated as unbound due to lack of technical feasibility. An economic needs test is frequently required for opening new bars or restaurants; citizenship requirements are sometimes imposed for liquor licenses and tourist guide licenses. In regard to commercial presence, market access is often guaranteed only for hotels in excess of a certain size, e.g. 50 or 100 rooms, with access for hotels below that size subject to an economic needs test. In some cases, licences are required for commercial presence, and in other cases, commercial presence is restricted to fixed equity limits. Benefits of GATS commitments The purpose of making GATS commitments in tourism, as with making commitments in any other services sector, is more than merely satisfying the demands of trading partners for market access. In many cases, the listing of tourism commitments is an important part of national development plans for this sector. By giving specific details of a country's tourism policies, in the form of market access, national treatment and additional commitments, the GATS schedule of a country serves an important transpar\u00ad ency function vis\u00ad\u00e0\u00advis both foreign and domestic investors and other interested potential services suppliers. Even more important, the listing of legally binding commitments also provides predictability: investors and other services suppliers are given a guarantee that investment policies and other tourism\u00ad related regulations will not suddenly be reversed or otherwise worsened. This predictability serves to enhance a country's attractiveness for investors, thereby improving growth prospects for the domestic tourism sector. Other general benefits of GATS commitments are: improving overall economic efficiency by provid\u00ad ing access to internationally competitive services, especially such crucial infrastructural services as tele\u00ad communications, transport and financial services; and helping to overcome domestic resistance to change by establishing internationally binding commitments which cannot easily be altered. Opportunities from new negotiations A new round of services negotiations is due to begin in January 2000. In addition to opportunities for negotiating with trading partners for increased market access in sectors of interest to developing country exporters, the new talks offer a chance for countries to 'lock\u00adin' their own development policies, as discussed above, in respect of tourism and infra\u00ad structure\u00adrelated services. The negotiations also pro\u00ad vide a highly visible, global forum where developing countries, both individually and as a whole, can draw the attention of both trading partners and services providers to their development policies and plans for trade liberalisation.

        "C o m b a t i ng child sex t o u r i s m . .. as part of the general contribution of the European Union to the fight against the sexual exploitation of children by Jean-Claude Eude* The European Commission has been aware for years both of the extent and ser iousness of the problem of child sex tourism and of the fact that European public opinion in general, and tour ists and the tourism industry in particular, are becoming increasingly sensitive to this problem. The specific proposals for action to be found in the Commis sion's Communication of 27 No vember 1996 on combating child sex tourism (OJ N\u00b0 C 3 of 07.01.1997) are part of the Eur opean Union's general contribution to intensifying the fight against the sexual exploitation of children. The Commission's Commu nication provides a reference fra mework for Community action to combat child sex tourism, placing it in a medium and long term per spective. The overall strategy set out in this document is twofold: - on the one hand, reducing de mand, in cooperation with the tourism industry and the NGOs concerned (coordination of infor mation and awareness-raising cam paigns, strengthening of the indus try's codes of conduct and self- regulatory mechanisms, etc.); - on the other hand, addressing the sources of supply in countries of destination, using all appropri ate means, including the Commu nity's external relations and devel opment cooperation policies. The European Parliament's Resolution of 6 November 1997 (OJ N\u00b0 C 358 of 24.11.1997) and the (Tourism) Council's Declaration of 26 November 1997 have revealed a broad agreement on the main features of the Commission's Com munication. This support has since been reaffirmed by the creation of a new budget line B7-663 (\u20ac500.000 for 1998, \u20ac1 million for 1999), with these funds intended for cam paigns in the European Union to counter the development of child sex tourism. The implementation of the proposals for action against child sex tourism started in 1997, focus ing on a limited number of tar- getted objectives responding to the need to deter and punish child sex abusers, to stem the flow of child sex tourists from the European Union, to help to combat child sex tourism in third countries and to encourage Member States to take a united stand against this phenom enon. Deterring and punishing abusers In this respect, reference has to be made to the joint action of the Council of 24 February 1997 concerning action to combat traf ficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children (OJ N\u00b0 L 63 of 04.03.1997) which opens the way to more effective laws and law enforcement, including extraterri torial criminal laws. It has to be mentioned also that the Commission, through the STOP programme and the DAPHNE initiative respectively, gives support to officials and professional work ers as well as non-governmental organisations and voluntary orga nisations active in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children. Nevertheless, responsibility for the apprehension and prosecu tion of offenders is a matter for the law enforcement and justice autho rities of the Member state con cerned. Stemming the flow of sex tourists from EU countries It was decided in 1997 to launch an initiative designed to reinforce the coordination, at a European level, of the national information and awareness-raising campaigns against child sex tour ism. The two projects already se lected for co-financing have been successfully implemented in 1998. Complementary projects should be supported this year also.

The aim of the terre des hommes project (E-mail: terre@t-online.de) is to make air travellers aware of the problem of child sex tourism. To this end, an information and awareness-raising spot produced by terre des hommes is being shown in aircraft during long-haul flights. Deutsche Lufthansa is the first airline to have decided to show such a spot during its long-haul flights. Talks are under way with other airlines in order to ensure the widest possible distribution of the message. The Groupe D\u00e9veloppement/ECPAT project (E-mail: 100636.3360@Compuserve.- com) has two objectives: - to inform travellers by distributing a 'luggage tag' accompanied by an information leaflet. Travellers are invited to put this 'luggage tag' on their cases to show their commitment to the fight against child sex tourism. 300,000 leaflets were handed out in 1998 to travellers in Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands; - to train those in the industry by developing teaching tools for lecturers in travel and tourism. The ECPAT teams in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have drawn on experience in France in developing their own teaching tools. By its nature, the project is intended to be extended to other countries of Europe. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "d o s s i er Europeans and their views on child sex tourism I Extracts from the executive summary \u2022 A large proportion (85%) of those questioned were 'aware' of the problem, which they regarded as 'widespread' (63%) and 'on the increase worldwide' (55%). \u2022 Although the phenomenon also affects EU territory, it is seen by the majority of Europeans as particularly acute in Asia (83%), Latin America (69%), Central and Eastern Europe (68%), and Africa (67%). \u2022 Child sex tourism is generally seen in Europe as being linked to poverty (72%), child sex abuse (55%), international trafficking in children (49%), social exclusion (37%) and extreme forms of child labour (25%). \u2022 There was almost universal moral condemnation (92%) of the practice, which was deemed 'illegal' by 88%, with a slightly smaller number (74%) including acts committed outside the territory of the Member States in the definition. \u2022 A small but significant proportion of those questioned (4%) claimed to have encountered the problem of child sex tourism on their holidays. \u2022 Learning that one of their holiday destinations is known to be a place where child sex tourism occurs would be enough to put half the European Union population (54%) off going there, while a larger number of Europeans (69%) would demand that services offered are in no way linked to this practice, and an even larger number (74%) would be especially careful if they went there. \u2022 To combat child sex tourism, seen as a largely 'avoidable' problem by 63% of European respondents, priority is given to punitive measures (38%) and prevention (36%), ahead of help for the child victims (22%). area was provided for the Eur opean Commission to present in itiatives in the field of combating child sex tourism. The 'First Eur opean meeting of the main part ners in the fight against child sex tourism' was also held in the con text of this professional fair, with the participation of many experts and prominent personalities. This 'event', organised at the initiative of the European Commission, was a genuine first, a far-reaching de monstration that kept pace with the increasing sensitivity shown by European public opinion with re gard to the perversion of tourism that is child sex tourism. In this respect, it has to be noted that a Eurobarometer survey on the issue of child sex tourism was carried out between 7 April and 27 May 1998. The results of this survey (16165 face-to-face in terviews all over the European Union) are being widely dissemi nated 1 . They constitute useful points of reference for all those involved in the fight against child sex tourism. Made available to the main partners in this fight, they should help to clarify the choices in terms of strategy development. Last, but not least, particu lar attention is being paid to encouraging the drawing up and application of standards of conduct likely to eliminate practices which are not in line with the tourism ethic. Helping combat child sex tourism in third countries The Community's external relations and development coop eration policies include pro grammes to uphold human rights under which funding is available to combat the sexual exploitation of children. These programmes fre quently involve partnership with NGOs and voluntary organisations active in the third countries con cerned. In this context, particular attention is being paid to rationa lising methods for action and co ordinating the Community re sources available for the protection of children who are victims of sex tourism. As part of the European Community strategy to support the development of sustainable tourism in the developing coun tries, efforts should continue to ensure that the matter of combat ing child sex tourism is addressed as part of a structured political dialo gue with the countries most af- European Commission - Directorate Gen eral XXIII, Europeans and their Views on Child Sex Tourism, Executive Summary of a Eurobarometer Survey, July 1998, 29 p. 2 See the Commission's Communication on A European Community strategy to support the development of sustainable tourism in the developing countries, CO M (1998) 563 final of 14.10.1998. fected, particularly at regional le vel 2 . Of particular concern to the Commission is the alarming rise of cases of sexual exploitation of children in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe which, in some cases, involve cross-border traffick ing. Within this region, the PHARE, TACIS and LIEN programmes in particular, work towards the pre vention of sexual exploitation and the recovery and reintegration of child victims. The need to include the issue of child sex tourism on the agenda of EU enlargement with the Eastern and Central Europe countries, and in the dialogue with other regions of the world (Asia notably), is highlighted in the Eco nomic and Social Committee's Opi nion of 2 July 1998 (OJ N\u00b0 C 284 of 14.09.1998). Encouraging EU Member States to take a united stand In its communication, the Commission considered it highly desirable that the Council should define its position, and called upon the Member States to dispel any doubt as to their willingness and ability to combat this affliction. The above mentioned (Tourism) Council's Declaration of 26 November 1997 constitutes a first step in this direction, together with the (Development) Council's Resolution of 30 November 1998. Finally, it is worth recalling that the Commission intends to produce a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the Eco nomic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, on the implementation of the mea sures planned and the progress made in combating child sex tour ism in 1997 and 1998.

        "Promoting health and m o b i l i ty A World Health Organisation/World Tourism Organisation initiative by Dr Volker Schulte* While tourism offers oppor\u00ad tunities for economic and social development, it can also bring with it a range of negative factors, many of which are related to health and the environment. The environmental impact of tra\u00ad vel and tourism has gained increasing attention in the wake of the global environ\u00ad mental movement. Re\u00ad sponses from the tourism industry have included a wide range of environmental and social awareness programmes as well as the development of holistic approaches such as 'healthy eco\u00ad tourism'. In considering the issue of sustainability in tourism, it is important to consider the role tour\u00ad ism can play in promoting health, the marketing of destinations in terms of health benefits, and the use of tourism in the context of medical treatment and therapy. From a tourism perspec tive, health issues will become more important as tourism ex pands and the number of interna tional travellers increases. The in dustry is already very large. In 1997, more than 600 million inter national travels took place, and by 2020, it is estimated that this figure will rise to 1600 million, given a projected average growth rate of 4.2% per annum (a con servative estimate). Inevitably, im portant health issues are raised. The World Health Organi sation (WHO) and World Tourism Organisation (WTO) have agreed to place a similar strategic focus on health issues arising from the *For further information, please contact: Dr Volker Schulte, Healthy Travel and Tour ism Initiative, Health Promotion Depart ment, Social Change and Mental Health cluster, World Health Organisation, 20 Ave nue Appia, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland, Tel.: +41 22 791 2259 Fax: +41 22 791 4186, schultev@who.ch increase in international tourism worldwide. The physical, economic and social dimensions of the en vironment are all-important to health, and ideally each aspect of the environment and its sustain able development should contri bute in a synergistic way to the promotion of health. The conceptual back ground for considering health in the context of tourism is the 'settings approach' - this is the notion of creating 'supportive en vironments for health'. In recogni tion of the complexities of the health risks confronting indivi duals and communities today, a number of major initiatives have already been pursued by WHO within this framework: Healthy Cities, Healthy Islands and Healthy Villages are just some of them. Within these broad contexts, focus has been placed on institutions to develop health-promoting envir onments: healthy market places, health promoting schools etc. Healthy tourism and mobility WHO and WTO represen tatives have started an initiative to provide guidelines for future ac tion, with an emphasis on the importance of working with the main stakeholders involved in, and affected by, global patterns of tourism. The suggested programme aims to make a constructive impact on tourism to ensure the avoid ance of health problems and the promotion of health among tra vellers and tourists and those associated with and affected by, tourism, in receiving countries. The programme aims to: - establish a healthy tourism net works with representatives of the private sector and developing countries - define priorities for action - select specific pilot initiatives The WHO/WTO initiative focuses on developing practical initiatives for healthy tourism the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "\u00ad establish health as an important factor for tourism (on a par with the environment and social dimen\u00ad sions) Focusing on practical initiatives We are focusing on practi\u00ad cal initiatives under two headings: information and standards. Healthy Tourism Informa\u00ad tion Campaign One major problem when dealing with health issues is the communication and dissemination of information. We have to focus on ways to implement in practice what is already known. WHO and WTO have produced brochures which give simple, practical advice as means of helping tourists to better inform themselves. The key issue is getting the message through. WHO and WTO will pro\u00ad vide information on health and protection for travellers and the host population. The healthy tour\u00ad ism programme will have its own pages within the WHO website, providing information to health professionals and to travellers themselves who have access to the Internet. Later on, this website will be linked to other travel health associations, consumer or\u00ad ganisations and NGOs, which cover the whole range of social and environmental protection. Standards and Guidelines It is important when devel\u00ad oping standards that information on existing standards is gathered together and that the programme builds on what has already been achieved. Health standards in the tourism context are already recog\u00ad nised as useful and important. They could be made bind\u00ad ing through contracts reached be\u00ad tween commercial organisations. Individual tour operators already produce some guidelines which could serve as a model. Priorities include food hygiene, sanitation, accidents and sexually transmitted diseases. We are only at the begin\u00ad ning of the Healthy Tourism in\u00ad itiative but already, increasing worldwide mobility is posing new questions, which require answers. \u25a0I v.s. H u m an resource d e v e l o p m e nt v i t al f or t he C a r i b b e an by Jean S. Holder* Sustainable development is a concept that often seems to marry two conflicting ideas: development and sus\u00ad tainability. Development has | often been closely allied I with growth and expan\u00ad I sion: higher Gross Domestic I Product (GDP), higher per I capita incomes, more infra\u00ad I structure, more facilities, in I short, more of everything. I On the other hand, sustain\u00ad ability implies conserving, equity and survival, and suggests ba\u00ad lanced growth through the pru\u00ad dent management and use of hu\u00ad man, financial and natural re\u00ad sources so that the resources remain intact and available for succeeding generations. The great\u00ad est challenge for developing states, hungry for capital invest\u00ad ment, is acquiring the ability to choose projects and programmes that reflect their long term inter\u00ad ests. In tourism, much of the development has traditionally been foreign\u00adled and dictated by external priorities. The Caribbean, which has many small island developing states (SIDs) with fragile ecologies, is four times more dependent on tourism than any other region of the world. The area is becoming increasingly dependent on tourism as its main engine of economic development because of threats to other traditional sectors such as export agriculture, mining and textiles. As a result, it is imperative that the planning process in our countries take on board sustain\u00ad able tourism strategies and man\u00ad agement practices that ensure a healthy outlook for the industry in the medium to long term. The Caribbean Tourism Or\u00ad ganisation (CTO), a regional body whose mission is 'the development 1 * Secretary General, Caribbean Tourism Organisation. of sustainable tourism for the economic and social benefit of the Caribbean people', recognises its responsibility to foster 'respon\u00ad sible' tourism. For us, sustainability can only be achieved by 'the optimal use of natural, cultural, social and financial resources for national development on an equi\u00ad table and self\u00adsustaining basis to provide a unique visitor experi\u00ad ence and an improved quality of life through partnership among government, the private sector and communities.' In this context we recog\u00ad nise several 'factors of sustainabil\u00ad ity' that are necessary conditions for the survival of the tourism industry. One of the most impor\u00ad tant is the development of human resources needed for idea forma\u00ad tion, policy creation, strategic planning and the implementation of plans. Without this, we can never really take control of our most vital economic sector. To date, we cannot be said to have laid a solid foundation in tourism education and training, at either the public or the private sector level. In the past 50 years, the economic achievements of tourism have been phenomenal. Yet there is probably no other economic activity which has raised so many questions, not just among the public at large, but even within the political authorities responsi\u00ad ble for it. The questions, which are many and varied, relate to the social, economic and environmen\u00ad tal impacts of tourism, its durabil\u00ad ity and its value as a career option. The sector is expert at selling its products but less so when it comes to selling itself. Even in regions like the Caribbean, where the business of providing holidays is pervasive, there is still strong re\u00ad sistance to the idea of teaching the subject of tourism within the school and university systems. CTO believes that there must be a sea change in these attitudes if the industry is to be transformed to meet the chal\u00ad the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",
        "d o s s i er lenges of the next century. This is why it has moved to establish a Caribbean Human Resource Devel\u00ad opment Council which is intended to preside over the introduction of new approaches to training and education in the Caribbean. Its first challenge will be to help to shape the new thinking in order to influence changes in behaviour. The building of awareness, knowl\u00ad edge, skills and new attitudes has to take place at a number of levels: \u00ad At the local/community level, via education, training and specific policies aimed at encoura\u00ad ging indigenous businesses and community participation. We must develop entrepreneurial skills within the community and encou\u00ad rage more indigenous business ownership so that the benefits are more evenly spread within the host country. \u00ad At the level of the con\u00ad sumer (the visitor), we must seek to heighten visitors' awareness of the need to behave responsibly, and try to mitigate any harmful environmental and social impacts of their holidays. Various mechan\u00ad isms should be employed here \u00ad specific literature in hotels, tour\u00ad ism information centres, bro\u00ad chures, and media campaigns. We should even be looking at the way we package and put over our messages about the destination. \u00ad In our own tourism busi\u00ad ness, we need enlightened man\u00ad Purpose\u00adbuilt tourism trainning centre in the Bahamas. The best way to invest in the future Is to have a well\u00adeducated and enlightened population that is capable of planning and managing the tourist industry on its own agement putting forward strate\u00ad gies that take account of econom\u00ad ic, social and environmental goals. Business enterprises must also see the need to train staff in the principles and practices of sustain\u00ad able tourism management. The adoption of voluntary codes of conduct, and participation in cer\u00ad tification programmes (for exam\u00ad ple Green Globe), where compa\u00ad nies can demonstrate that they are addressing environmental and so\u00ad ciocultural issues, are important steps in the right direction. \u00ad At the governmental le\u00ad vel, decision makers will have to take part in \u00a1ntersectoral planning activities to ensure that important linkages with other sectors are maximised and to make certain that the industry fits into the framework of the country's overall development thrust. Governments also have an important role in regulating the industry. In doing this, they must understand how to use the indicators employed in monitoring sustainability in areas such as water quality and beach erosion. Continuous research, and environmental impact assessments are also critical, while businesses that deploy sound sustainable tourism practices need to be given recognition. \u00ad In schools, colleges and universities, we need an enligh\u00ad tened public policy giving top priority to human resource devel\u00ad opment in tourism. Local and aid resources should be deployed on a strategy that addresses the need for systems, institutions and rele\u00ad vant curricula at every level in the educational stream. Our tourism curricula must address environ\u00ad mental, social and cultural issues as part of the education process. We need to find ways of attracting the brightest students into the industry so that we develop a cadre of excellence to service the industry. Our institutions must also prepare and disseminate case stu\u00ad dies which promote 'best sustain\u00ad able tourism practices'. In conclusion, at different levels, using a variety of ap\u00ad proaches, the key stakeholders in the industry have a vital role to play in enhancing the prospects for sustainable tourism develop\u00ad ment. Our challenge is to manage the development of tourism so as to maximise the benefits in terms of jobs, revenue and investment, while safeguarding the integrity of local cultures and protecting the natural environment. At the end of the day we must not forget that the ultimate goal of the host country in developing tourism is to improve the quality of life of the local population. The best way to invest in the future is to have a well\u00adeducated and enlightened population that is capable of plan\u00ad ning and managing the industry in its own best interests. \u25a0 J.H.

        "The m e a n i ng of s u s t a i n a b le d e v e l o p m e nt by Auliana Poon* By sustainable development, we mean the use and ex ploitation of today's re sources in such a manner that these resources will be available for use by future generations. In other words, consumption today with to morrow in mind. The tourism indus- *, try can be described as the I sum of persons, activities, events, places, facilities and businesses that are involved in satisfying or servicing travellers from one geogra phical region in another. In other words, everything from car rental to sleeping accommodation, cur rency exchange, safaris, food and drink and much, much more. Tourism is more dependent on the environment than any other industry (perhaps with the exception of extractive industries such as mining). Tourism depends on the environment for its own sake (it must be clean and safe to attract the interest of travellers). Tourism is also a major user of the environment. Almost all of its activities - walking, diving, rafting, golf, fishing and so on, are based in and around the environment. Two key forces are driving the development of sustainable tourism: the new tourists, and new private sector initiatives. The new tourists are waking up to the calls of NGOs, local governments and the media, as well as to the hard reality that things cannot go on the way they used to. The private sector, in a new enligh tened approach, is heeding the demands of the new tourist for a safer and cleaner environment and more contact with locals. Both the new tourists and the new private sector are good news for sustainable tourism. * Economist and tourism expert. The author led the team that developed the tourism policy and strategy for the new South Africa in 1996. New tourists The demands of the tour ists for a quality environment and contact with locals is a major force for sustainable tourism develop ment. The case of the German market clearly bears this out. A 1997 survey by Studienkreis f\u00fcr Tourismus und Entwicklung found that 40% of Germans are willing to pay \u20ac1 per day on holiday to help save the environment in their holiday destinations - giving a potential total of \u20ac608 million. The study also found that: - for 80% of those surveyed, an intact environment is important in choosing their holiday destination; - Nearly 55% would like to experi ence nature first hand while on holiday; - 7 1% found a desolate landscape a 'turn-off'; - 34% enjoy watching wildlife; - 32% enjoy nature and visit national parks; - 17% are angered by environ mental destruction; and, - 67% would like to receive en vironment information through travel companies. The travel preferences of German tourists increasingly de monstrate that travellers in the future will be won over by clean, healthy and intact environments. German visitors to the Maldives are so environmentally-conscious that they take their rubbish back home with them! Shortly before landing at Male, LTU's passengers are provided with bin bags in which they deposit their suntan lotion bottles, batteries for walk- mans, razors and other refuse that are difficult to dispose of in the Maldives. LTU flies the refuse back to Germany. According to LTU, 80% of its passengers participate in the programme, which was launched in 1994. Another important devel opment in the German market is the growing interest in local cul ture and contact with locals. This aspect of German travel behaviour is often not documented. In the same study, 76% of respondents said that respect for the traditions, culture and lifestyle of the local populations was important in their holiday experience. Effective mar ket demand for local culture, and the experience of local traditions and lifestyles, opens an important opportunity for local people to become more involved in the tourism industry. New private sector initiatives New private sector initia tives are also a key driving force in the development of sustainable tourism. Two excellent examples are the Curtin Bluff Hotel in Anti gua (see box) and the Umngazi River Bungalows in South Africa which was featured in issue 171 of the Courier (p. 83) These examples from Afri ca and the Caribbean shed some light on the issue of sustainable development. This is not only the Curtin Bluff Hotel, Antigua This is a shining Caribbean example of local community involvement. The hotel is located in the poorest part of Antigua, on two beautiful beaches. Because of the initiatives of the hotel's owners and managers, ensuring that the local community benefits from tourism, there is no need for keys to the guest rooms. Curtin Bluff's clients are free and safe in an environment that is also friendly to the local community. According to the manager, Rob Sherman, 'we take care of the village and they take care of us'. The hotel operates at 85% occupancy annually and is one of the most successful tourist accommodation ventures in the Caribbean. Curtin Bluff financed the overseas education of five local children from its village fund (at a cost of $100,000). Every year, it sends 15 of its staff abroad for training. Employees are well-paid and, uniquely, have a pension fund. Turnover of staff and management is low (some have been there for more than 30 years) and the hotel has 75% repeat business. Curtin Bluff also encourages the local community to undertake activities that save and beautify their environment. Young people are encouraged and rewarded for every tree they plant. The hotel uses its facilities to train youths from the village to play tennis - many have become tennis coaches at the hotel and the community provides the island's main tennis 'stars'. 1 the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "government's responsibility; it is not just about the new tourists, national parks and park animals. It is also about the local people and the partnership between the pri vate sector and local communities. Much of the focus of sus tainable tourism development has been on the building of national parks and protected areas (the development of so-called eco-tour ism), saving endangered plants and animals, birds, bees and fish. These actions are necessary. How ever, they are not sufficient to deliver sustainable tourism. It is vital, in addition, to involve local people. It is important that efforts are placed on ensuring that locals are meaningfully involved in, and benefit from, sustainable tourism initiatives. A significant proportion of 'new' tourists enjoy watching wildlife Nature is not destroyed by itself. Much of the destruction is person-made (to use the politically correct expression). Sustainable tourism can only be guaranteed if those who have benefited from the destruction of nature benefit instead from protecting and con serving it. Too often, undue em phasis is placed on the tourists (the beneficiaries of the good, clean environment) and the animals (now they can roam free and their meals are secure as everything they feed on is also protected). Insufficient attention is placed on ensuring that the benefits from conservation flow down to local people and the communities that d o s s i er are in close proximity to the natural resources exploited for tourism. Unless this delicate balance is achieved, unfortunately, park animals will remain a good source of protein, valuable trees will still be an important fuel source and tourists a quick source of easy money. Sustainable development, therefore, is as much about the local people as it is about conser ving nature. It is also about an equal distribution of the benefits of conservation. In this regard, benefits cannot only be for future generations, but also for the cur rent generation - especially the local people who are often mar ginalised from the process of sus tainable development. To summarise, Curtin Bluff and Umngazi are examples of the types of initiative that sustainable and responsible tourism are made of. The key mission must be to create a 'new tourism' where the examples cited are not merely examples but indicators of 'best practice'. Partnerships between the public and private sectors, NGOs, local communities and even donor agencies are critical in order to ensure that this new 'best practice' becomes a reality. B A . P. Sanddollars a nd w h i te crystal by Jacob Langvad* Lamu is Kenya's oldest town and one of the historic ports of the slave trade that stopped only 92 years ago. Today, tourism is the only major trade left. So far the exquisite island of Lamu has managed to save its unique Swahili culture. But mass tourism and overpopulation threaten its appeal to the choosy traveller. Few places on the East African coast breathe history like the island of Lamu. The 14th century town of stone houses with * Brussels correspondent for the Danish newspaper, 'Berlingske Tidende'. open drainage running through the narrow streets is Kenya's old est. Since the 1970s, Lamu has attracted a mixed crowd of tour ists, trendy hippies, backpackers and gay men rubbing shoulders with affluent rock stars and deep- sea fishermen attracted by the tasteful luxury of the Peponi Ho tel. Some bring their families to savour the deserted beach that stretches for miles, littered with starfish and thousands of sanddol- lars, the flat white sea urchins that resemble the faces of sleepy cats. Lamu's remoteness, way up north on the coast, has been diminished by the airport on a neighbouring island, but in spite of modernity creeping in here and there, this is still a quiet one-car island, and its unique Swahili cul ture remains largely intact. Until the arrival of tourism in the 1970s, the island languished as a result of the belated abolition of slavery in 1907. Back then, the slaves were the basis of a strong economy, humans serving both as objects of commerce and cheap labour. Arabs from Oman ran the business. Hav ing settled on the coast, they controlled the slave trade for centuries, bringing the Muslim faith with them. This past reads like an open book in the faces of the Lamu people with their blend of Arab and African blood. Most women are covered top to bottom in black cloth, but unlike their sisters on the Arabian peninsula, their faces remain unveiled, sug gesting the more liberated African version of Islam. The key to the island's history is the monsoon winds that permitted long distance commerce in humans, ivory and mangrove poles. The dhow is the vessel that brought Lamu in touch with places as distant as India and China. This low wooden boat, distinguished by its proud sand coloured sail in the shape of a shark's fin, is still made on Lamu today. the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 I ",
        "d o s s i er From Lamu down to Zanzi\u00ad bar, the trade in humans lingered for decades after its demise in West Africa. Despite the smaller numbers involved, by a strange twist of fate, the slave trade here was to play a dramatic role in the history of the continent. When the cunning King Leopold II of the Belgians planned his colonisation of the Congo, his first move was to organise the 1876 Geographical Conference in Brussels. Presenting himself as a philanthropist, he invented a noble pretext for the occasion. He proclaimed that a civilised presence was urgently needed to do away with the heinous Arab slave trade that still prevailed on the East African coast. Coming only a decade after the American abolition of slavery, this was an important moral dis\u00ad guise that brought momentum to the Brussels\u00adconference and made it a turning point. It quickly trig\u00ad gered the 'Scramble for Africa', and two decades later, European colonisation of the 'Dark Conti\u00ad nent' was complete. Slavery is a thing of the past, but the dhows still sway on the tide, now carrying another human cargo \u00ad romantically\u00adin\u00ad clined tourists on sunset trips. But all is not well on this side of paradise. Foreign money is buying up small hotels en bloc, opening noisy discos to make way for large scale tourism, and Lamu's popula\u00ad tion is growing too fast for the old city to house its new children. Dependence on tourism is increas\u00ad ing and too much ends up being up for sale. The porcelain from China and spices from India that the dhows brought back in past centuries have been replaced by less innocent goods. On the square in front of Lamu Fort, the softspoken Yuseef invites tourists to his house for a dish of home\u00adcooked crabs and fish for a few hundred shillings. Once confidence is established over lunch, he pulls out offers like rabbits from a top hat. How about a visit to the ruins on Pat\u00e9 Island?

Q Will I be supporting a repressive regime by travelling to this country? Q Is my tour operator committed to strong ethical and environmental standards \u25a1 Who owns the hotel where I will stay? Q Will my tastes increase the demand for food, goods and services from my homeland? Q What will I leave behind? Q Will my purchases support the local economy? Q Were local people forced out to make room for tourist development? Q Have I educated myself about local customs and culture? Q Does my presence create or improve local jobs? \u25a1 How will my presence influence young people ? \u25a1 Will I have an opportunity to involve myself in the local community? \u25a1 After I return home, what will I do with my experience ? The dhow is the vessel that brought Lamu in touch with places as distant as India and China Snorkelling off the coral reef! Or some Banghi? (the local marijua\u00ad na) Or some White Crystal! (cheap heroin shipped in from Karachi via Mombasa). There is no major drug scene here, but the readiness to supply the occasional tourist has had a nasty spin\u00adoff and you can now find a sad handful of drug\u00ad addicted locals. While queuing to change dollars at Lamu's only bank, you will come across men like 7ean Claude. The sporty French pen\u00ad sioner has driven all the way here in his old Land Rover, finding spare parts in every corner of the continent, and he is as happy as a clam. By his side is a beautiful, moody young girl, not a day over 18. One might reckon her to be the daughter of an African friend. But when asked if the girl is Kenyan, the short answer vibrates with such enthusiasm, that even a starry\u00adeyed journalist gets the pic\u00ad ture: 'Oui, elle est superbe!' (Yes, she is superb!) The Nike\u00adsneakers and orange coloured shorts place her as a cool city girl from the Christian Highlands around Nairo\u00ad bi, rather than a Moslem from the coast. But sitting deadly quiet on the bench while her benefactor gets his cash, she seems immersed in an air of shame. Not letting anybody catch her eye, she knows that anyone, who cares to think twice, will realise that she is a companion, on a brief holiday, all expenses paid by the contented Frenchman. It is a very old story, and it's not really romantic. MM 11 I the Courier n\" 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",

The developing coun\u00ad tries play a direct part. Either they are selected as a desti\u00ad nation or investors from these countries cooperate in international investment projects, and thus either hold shares or even majority stakes in corporate ventures. The aim of the hotel groups and investors is to participate in the anticipated profit growth in this area of industry and to achieve returns higher than those in other sectors. However, hotels with an international brand name also re\u00ad present trademarks whose effect is to act as a stimulus to the tourism industry, with possibilities for growth and reactions in the employ\u00ad ment market far beyond the imme\u00ad diate significance of the enterprise itself. If the developing countries are to take advantage of this situa\u00ad tion, then the respective govern\u00ad ments need to establish the neces\u00ad sary framework which will encou\u00ad rage foreign investments.

Joint ven tures have reached dimensions which make a mockery of the ideas one had decades ago of the capacity limits in the hotel indus try. Hospitality Franchise System, the largest provider, has more than 5000 hotels and approxi mately 500,000 beds. They are followed by Best Western with nearly 3500 hotels and 280,000 beds, and Choice Hotels Interna tional with around 2900 hotels Since the mid-1990s, mergers have been taking place in the international hotel industry at breakneck speed and close to 250,000 beds. Other placings are occupied by Accor with about 2300 hotels and almost 270,000 beds as well as by Holiday Inn Worldwide with in excess of 2000 hotels and 370,000 beds. The group consisting of Hilton Hotels/ Hilton International and ITT has more than 270,000 beds in almost 800 hotels. Most of the enterprises have their seat in the USA, with the exception of Accor whose head office is in France. Japanese enterprises are placed further down the list among the 30 largest hotel groups. Investors from the Middle East and the Southeast Asian threshold countries have also, virtually unnoticed, acquired holdings in hotel groups in Europe and North America. It is rumoured that emirates from the Persian Gulf have acquired holdings in the Four Seasons/Regent and Fair- the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 I ",
        "d o s s i er mont hotel groups. It is said that certain families in Brunei have substantial holdings in the French hotel group PA Holdings France SA. Individual luxury hotels in European and North American cities are owned by rich families from North Africa and the Middle East as well as East Asia. The economic idea behind the joint ventures The investors are following a traditional economic route. Tra ders from Hong Kong and Thai land have gained holdings in hotel groups. While to date, monied Chinese families have been keen to augment their wealth and pro tect their capital by an increasing number of land purchases, and by acquiring holdings in banks and industries both in Southeast Asian and industrialised countries, their interest has turned now towards investing in the worldwide hotel industry. As a result of this partici pation in international groups, investors are anticipating high profits, and due to the size and geographical distribution of the properties in question, expect the risk of capital loss to be low. The motives for hotel groups purchasing enterprises and acquiring holdings are also easily recognised. Operating rather than building hotels would currently seem to be an extremely profitable investment. In 1997, hotel turn over worldwide was $250 billion, which ranks as the largest single amount as far as expenditure in international tourism is concerned. According to surveys by American Express, companies in the USA spent $156 bn for hotel overnight stays in 1996 with a growth rate of 4% expected for 1997. At present, the assumption is that top-level hotels will be able to demand high prices for overnights and other services. Following cuts to middle management in international com panies, traditionally frequent tra vellers, the members of top-level management have taken over this role. They have higher per diem rates for hotel bednights and services than were previously af forded to the middle manage ment. In addition, for economic reasons, it suits the purpose to combine hotels into groups under one name. The assumption is that the services on offer effectively constitute a standardised product, judged by the consumer on the basis of cost and quality received. Sales of bednights and related services are no longer a family affair or the domain of a small enterprise, with a personalised owner-guest relationship provid ing satisfaction for the customer. Rather, a new kind of customer has emerged with a disinterested view of the performance on offer by a hotel. Under these circum stances, optimum hotel sizes grow far beyond the scope of an indivi dual operation. Larger enterprises are more capable of ensuring stable earnings, and can equalise losses made in individual countries and regions. Globalisation in economics and travel requires hotels to estab lish their presence worldwide. Sales and takeovers on a global scale take the mobility of the customer into account. Many ob servers have noted that brand names whose presence is not worldwide are not received as well by the customer as the hotel groups, in spite of offering good prices and quality. Providing the same, locally adapted services worldwide is expedient, offering the customer security, comfort, and reliability, and reducing the time expenditure for bookings and reservations. Large hotel groups consid er themselves to be at an advan tage, because administration and booking can be reduced to a minimum. This allows hotel man agement to provide more custo mer support and to increase ef forts in an aim to restructure hotels as focal points for a variety of services. This enters a domain which extends beyond the scope of conventional hotel activities, with the intention of bringing the travel location in question closer to the customer with the entire bandwidth of services avail able. The ability to transfer dis counts and other privileges is an other advantage associated with marketing hotel groups and en terprises whose presence is world wide. A factor not least to be taken into account, and recog nised by some, is that hotel pur chases and mergers reduce compe tition. On the other side of the economic advantages are the ex penditures which occur as a result of coordination between indivi dual locations. Initially, it is neces sary to invest in local manage ment, as any type of cooperation needs to take into account differ ent laws and the resultant effect on hotel operations in different countries. Continuous quality con trol is necessary to maintain uni form standards. If individual loca tions are unable to fulfil the demands made of them, then they will be required to adapt, and in the last resort, wearying negotia tions will ensue for the purpose of cancelling the contracts. Opportunities and challenges in the developing countries Developing countries will be able to view international co operation with hotels in a positive light if they develop their tourism industry, and also if economic growth, social progress and pro tection of natural resources can be guaranteed. From the point of view of governments and the people of developing countries, cooperation has its advantages because the presence of globally organised hotel groups will spark an influx of visitors to the country, because capital and know-how can be provided for successful manage ment, and because it then be comes easier to market tourism. In many developing countries, both management know-how and the necessary capital for large investments do not exist. Market ing local tourism is frequently very difficult here because providers are not in touch with the market in industrialised countries. Interna tional groups want to operate their hotels at a profit and need to fill capacities. For this reason, it is fundamental to their success to make potential customers at home aware of the possibilities the groups can provide in the devel oping countries, with the aim of inviting these customers to travel there. Effects such as these will only register in the developing countries if hotel groups and own- 1 [I the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "d o s s i er ers of capital consider the climate for investment to be good and effects on interest and capital to be advantageous in the long term. In addition, a good infrastructure, plus what is on offer to travellers from industrialised countries must strike a chord with potential cus tomers. It is therefore necessary that developing countries provide the same conditions for both for eign and local investors. Enter prises should be secure in the knowledge that decision-making is supported by the laws of market economics. Governments should also regulate their income and expenditures in a way that ensures a secure economic foundation for investment. Independent fiscal po licies must provide the basis for stable prices and interest rates. It would be useful to liberalise for eign relations and to protect trans actions from short-term interven tion by the government. Unhin dered transfer of earnings and capital should be legally guaran teed. The ability to invest is proportional to an infrastructure favouring tourism. To this end, air and sea ports must be adequate and operate properly, a transport infrastructure which meets travel lers' needs is required, proper access to places of interest must be available, and areas must exist to allow tourism, the environment When hotels are combined into groups under one name, the assumption is that the services on offer effectively constitute a standardised product, judged by the consumer on the basis of cost and quality received and social structures to co-exist. The non-material infrastructure consists of trained hotel personnel as well as of flexible negotiating partners inside the governments and tourism offices of the devel oping countries. The greater the positive effect on local tourism and on the economy, society and natural resources alike, the more the de veloping countries will provide positive conditions for investment by owners of foreign capital. In return for being offered such con ditions, the individual enterprises can play their part by complying with the interests of the develop ing nation. It is fundamental to observe the laws governing em ployment and employment secur ity, those on the protection of natural resources and laws uphold ing fair competition. The state of the developing countries can be improved by foreign investors making an effort to improve local employees' qualifications and by entrusting them increasingly with management responsibilities. If foreign investors can also succeed in giving contracts to local suppli ers and gain their confidence as partners, then governments will reciprocate and cooperate closely with foreign enterprises in the creation of the economic frame work conditions. The governments of devel oping countries should not only assist foreign investors by imple menting supportive economic measures but should also provide conditions for establishing and expanding local companies to al low these to provide their services as partners of foreign enterprise. It would seem that the outlook for the developing coun tries for offering their locations for cooperation with international ho tels is at present not at all bad. Political and economic reforms during the 1990s in countries, which for a long time barred foreign capital.and know-how from their shores, now provide a suitable climate for attracting for eign investment. These countries are visibly making an effort to improve their tourism offer. In the present world economic cli mate, it would seem that the traditional focal areas preferred by foreign investors in the Third World, such as the Southeast Asian threshold countries, have lost their attraction for international inves tors, due to current difficulties in securing economic growth and ensuring social progress. The lower levels in earnings in these coun tries, as a result of declines in prices, at present provide no at traction for international hotel groups. Other developing coun tries must go about providing good conditions for investment and must pursue economic policies with an eye to improving their enterprises and their tourism offer, and exploiting the present condi tions as best they can.

        "Dossier Ethnie p r o d u c t s: a niche to d e v e l op Under the name of 'ethnic products' are food products whose origin is clearly iden tifiable and that are con sumed abroad mainly by ex patriates - from ACP coun tries. This range of products excludes fresh products and exotic fruit. The Caribbean, for example, constitutes a fa vourite destination for tra vellers attracted by warm seas and breathtaking scen ery. Various countries from this region have understood the marketing potential represented by this power of attraction that could enable them to valorise certain local products, including a series of specialities produced by small businesses whose production secrets lead to original products. Multicultural consumers Success in the marketing of these products first began in the United States, then in Canada, where the expatriate communities are larger and more varied. It CDI The Centre for the Development of Industry (CDI) is a joint ACP-EU institution created in the framework of the Lom\u00e9 Convention linking the European Union with the 71 ACP countries (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific). Its objective is to support the creation, expansion and restructuring of industrial companies in ACP countries. To this effect, the Centre promotes partnerships between ACP and European companies. These part nerships may take various forms: financial, technical and commercial partnerships, management contracts, licensing or fran chise agreements, sub-contracting, etc. Editor: Mr. Surendra Sharma Director of the CDI Avenue Herrmann Debroux, 52 B-1160 Brussels, Belgium Tel.: +32 2 679 18 11 Fax: +32 2 675 26 03 e-mail: director@cdi.be Internet Website: www.cdi.be crossed the Atlantic to gradually gain a foothold in Europe. The countries having had colonies have become multicultural societies that are favourable for the marketing success of ethnic products from, among others, ACP countries. Why this craze for ethnic products? Because people feel a growing attraction to 'somewhere far away' and search to add variety to their diet, sometimes with a concern for authenticity and/or dietary benefits. We can deter mine four categories of the com ponents considered: prepared dishes, ingredients, snacks and drinks. The majority of these eth nic products is found in various heavily generalised types of cui sine such as Indian, Chinese and Tex'-Mex' (Texan-Mexican). Is there room in this consumption sector for ACP products? There is reason to believe so because studies car ried out in France indicate that 40% of households have already purchased ethnic products other than pizza and paella. African cuisines are, to a certain degree, little known. But taste for Carib bean cuisine is growing. Who produces and imports ethnic products? The supply of ethnic foods has two sources: imports and local production in Europe. The produc tion sector is shared by food- industry multinationals and SMEs, including family businesses. If the former have specialised in local production, the latter are both producers and importers. In addi tion to the producers' brands, distributors add their own brand names. Where can ethnic products be found? We can divide the ethnic product distribution network into three segments: (1) supermarkets and department stores; (2) grocer's shops (ethnic or delicatessen); (3) restaurants and caterers. The chal lenge consists of getting out of the distribution aimed at specific communities to achieve large-scale distribution and the sector of delicatessen products, for example the specialised shops (Delicatessen) in Germany. In Great Britain, the market for ethnic products emerged thanks to the efforts made by a few independent dis tributors that serve the some two million residents belonging to eth nic minorities. African products are ab sent from large-scale distribution in France. Yet, some companies are attempting to launch a few Afri can dishes such as chicken with peanut sauce. In Belgium, two African products are found on the shelves of certain supermar kets: saka (manioc leaves) and moambe (spicy sauce with palm oil). But these are produced in Asia and distributed in Belgium under distributor brand names. The dis tribution of most African foods and ingredients takes place in the grocer's shops. However, this type of food does not appeal much to non-Africans because it is not well- adapted to the requirements and I the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "cdi p a r t n e r s h ip expectations of European consu mers. The lack of specialised Afri can businesses in ethnic products destined for Europeans and the overly discreet presence of African restaurants contribute to the lack of success for this rich and diversi fied cuisine. Caribbean cuisine is char acterised by a judicious mixture of spices and local sauces that accom pany common food products. The word 'Caribbean', as if it were magic, suffices to attract favour able attention from consumers. The production and marketing efforts have a promising founda tion upon which to build. Creating a marketing policy The existence of an emer ging market for ethnic products raises a few very important issues: - the awareness of the economic potential of the various cuisines concerned; - the perspectives for ACP produ cers of various products; Publicity for a trade fair in Mozambique featuring, among other items, local food products. There is a need for effective promotion. - the possibility of developing companies specialised in produc tion for export; - an additional channel to valorise traditional marginal agricultural products in international markets; - the chance to develop traditional agri-business techniques; - the additional means of teaching traditional techniques in agri-busi ness schools in ACP countries; - t he possibility of building on this market to develop the ACP coun tries' own food industry; - the opportunity to consider a traditional culinary practice as an exportable service; - the creation of jobs and the improving of income for the pro ducers of the various ingredients used in the production of local dishes. What should be done in ACP countries to promote effec tively? First, it is necessary to study in more detail the European mar ket and its receptiveness for ethnic products to orient thought toward the manner - rather, the multitude of ways - of favouring production in these countries and consump tion in Europe. The consumption monitors are beginning to take an interest in this type of food. In 1997, the French market for ethnic products represented turnover es timated at FRF 1.4 billion, com pared with 933 million in 1995 and 1 billion in 1996. The annual growth appears to be 10%. If this rate is maintained, turnover should near FRF 2 billion in 2003. In 1998, nearly 60% of French households bought at least one ethnic product. A study carried out in 1998 for CDI reveals that, in Great Britain, the 'exotic' cuisine that appeals most is Indian (45%), followed by Chinese (31%) and Mexican (11%); Thai cuisine is gradually emerging and is well ahead of cuisines from the Carib bean, Indonesia/Malaysia and Ja pan. Another study carried out in 1998 for CDI shows that continen tal Europeans prefer Oriental food with Tex'-Mex' and Indian cuisine coming in second and third. The products sold include appetisers, groceries, catered products, frozen products, pre-cooked dishes and alcoholic beers. Professionals from the sector ensure that pre-cooked dishes account for more than 50% of the market. The sauces account for the second highest share of sales volume. The table illustrates the distribution of the Belgian market for ethnic products. The Belgian market totals BEF 600 million (\u20ac14.9m). The Belgian market for ethnic products Products Oriental Mexican ndian African sraeli Annual Turnover (\u20acm) 7.50 2.50 1.25 1.00 0.50 The impetus of ethnic restaurants A consumption vehicle that should be welcome is a strong presence of ACP cultures in each European country: clothing, tour ist offices, art objects, music, etc. Large efforts must be made to foster a positive image of each ACP country because this image will encourage the consumption of products coming from these parts of the world. As food has a large impact on people, the multiplica tion of specific-type restaurants that offer good, exotic cuisine, including the hotel restaurants in ACP countries, can only amplify the craze Europeans have for the ethnic products that are invariably associated with this cuisine. The industry professionals agree that ethnic restaurants have played and will continue to play a major role in the development of the market for ethnic products. As an exam ple, in France there are 16,000 Oriental restaurants, 3000 Italian restaurants, 980 Tex'-Mex' and only 300 African restaurants. Informing the consumer Consumers increasingly search for original and authentic dishes that are easy to prepare. They demand: - that the taste be adapted (ex ample: not spicy); - that the labelling meet European standards in terms of weight and content; the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "cdi p a r t n e r s h ip I Walker's Wood restaurant in London Since 1974 in Jamaica, Walker's Wood has been producing a range of typical products - jerks, sauces, jams, etc. - that it successfully exports to the USA, UK and continental Europe. The company has benefited from CDI support on a number of occasions in the fields of quality control and the search for new markets. The idea of opening a restaurant in which only Caribbean dishes are served sprouted in the minds of a few enterprising partners. The motivations were to create greater awareness of the Caribbean and profit from an excellent local market for ethnic products from the region. Walker's Wood serves menus representative of all Carib bean countries. In addition to the meals served in the restaurant, take-away dishes are available such as grilled chicken with jerk sauce. All the typically Caribbean products are imported from that region. Walker's Wood opened on September 24, 1997 with 30 seats and two teams totalling ten employees, all Caribbean expatriates: Barbados, Jamaica, etc. (the current chef is from Saint Lucia). The d\u00e9cor was carefully designed to be reminiscent of the Caribbean, and the atmosphere aims to put all budgets at ease. Turnover should reach \u00a34000-5000 per week by the end of 1999. The promotion of the restaurant is carried out through the distribution of pamphlets in mailboxes and, occasionally, by advertising in the traditional media. Much-appreciated support was given by the Sainsbury chain of supermarkets (Nr 2 in Great Britain): One day, 11 of its managers dined at the restaurant. Convinced by the quality, Sainsbury orga nised a 'Caribbean Food' day followed by an information campaign in four large UK newspapers (including The Times) on Walker's Wood and the ethnic products of that region. The owners of Walker's Wood hope to open similar restaurants, first in Belgium and the Netherlands, then in France and Germany. Hi CDI Contact: Acquah Dodet Malenge - explicit recipes to reassure con sumers; - quick preparation, with prepara tion time indicated; - information available at point of sale. The tourism-cuisine combi nation previously mentioned ap pears nearly indissociable. It is, however, vital to accompany the products sold by adding recipes illustrating their many culinary possibilities: in many cases, the ingredients for sale will not be purchased if the customer is not informed about how to use them. Tasting and demonstration activ ities in large supermarkets, for example, constitute a very useful means of moving the consumer from the stage of casual interest - or even desire - to that of pur chasing a product with the high probability that he will renew the process based on his genuine sa tisfaction. It is wise to consider that the use of products culturally accessible to Europeans (chicken, rice, etc.) favours their becoming a consumption habit. This explains the recent success of dishes com bining exotic and familiar tastes: by using exotic recipes with pro ducts that are part of European food habits, there is a better chance of attracting the consumer toward dishes that are more and more exotic/ethnic. 'Exotic' snacks and drinks, and gourmet products In addition to pre-cooked dishes, ingredients and drinks, the snack market can be considerably developed by taking advantage of the growing habit of snacking (while watching television, at the movies, etc.) It would be advisable to make a list of all the ethnic products that correspond with or could be adapted to this vast market niche. Although many ethnic food products are experiencing growing success, the market for ethnic drinks - alcoholic or non alcoholic - remains little devel oped. In Great Britain, the situa tion has changed somewhat with the introduction of an Indian beer and a line of exotic fruit juices. The availability of Caribbean and African beer can also be included in this group. Another very profitable market segment involves gourmet products, which require special I the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "c di p a r t n e r s h ip handling and packaging. An example of the possible success is provided by Busha Brown in Jamaica, a company that received CDI as\u00ad sistance in mar\u00ad keting opera\u00ad tions. The specialised shops in Germany mentioned above are a very effective sales channel, espe\u00ad cially since most of these points of sale are often associated with a fast\u00adfood service. A priority for CDI The import of food pro\u00ad ducts from ACP countries is subject to the laws of each European country, to European hygiene stan\u00ad dards and to the agreements made between the EU and the ACP countries. Starting in 1995, CDI and the German cooperation body (GTZ) began supporting Caribbean gourmet products. In 1996, a mis\u00ad sion of consultants supported by CDI and GTZ went to six Caribbean countries (Bar\u00ad bados, Belize, Dominican Re\u00ad public, Grena\u00ad da, Jamaica, Tri\u00ad nidad & Toba\u00ad go) to study the possibilities of e x p o r t i ng gourmet pro\u00ad ducts to Ger\u00ad many and, in general, to Europe. The experts selected 25 companies whose high\u00adquality and varied products should interest importers. They met with companies already ex\u00ad porting, mainly to the US, and who had mastered the require\u00ad ments of international trade. This procedure led to the presentation, in Wiesbaden in March 1997, of 145 products to importers, d i s t r i b u t o r s, and restaura\u00ad teurs.

During the Anuga Inter\u00ad national Food Fair organised in late 1997 in Cologne, CDI (with co\u00ad financing from GTZ, the German Technical Cooperation body) mana\u00ad ged to gather about 20 small com\u00ad panies for a grouped presentation of 'Caribbean Products' to German buyers and foreign buyers from all over the world who visited this major fair. Following the fair, a few companies, including Walker's Wood, were able to enter certain continental European markets on a very small scale. In early 1999, CDI launched a sec\u00ad ond phase in conjunction with GTZ and the Caribbean companies (above all from Jamaica and Trini\u00ad dad & Tobago), as well as regional market\u00adpromotion organisations (JAMPRO, CEDA, TIDCO). In addi\u00ad tion to a new, highly\u00adeffective mar\u00ad keting consultant recruited by CDI, this phase involves German profes\u00ad sionals: a large importer spedalised in ethnic products \u00ad presented in groups by geographic origin to globalise and reinforce the brand image \u00ad and a large distribution chain. In May 1999, two weeks of pro\u00ad moting Caribbean products will take place at some 50 points of sale in about 10 large German cities. Some 20 Caribbean companies will offer approximately 80 products with the goal of having 20 of the products become a permanent part of wide\u00adscale distribution. The am\u00ad bition is to achieve preliminary orders totalling \u20ac180,000 for the Caribbean exporters. Entertainment will take place around the stands: the organisers have obtained the participation of Miss Jamaica. Com\u00ad petitions will be staged, bands will play local music and chefs straight from the Caribbean (including a renowned chef) will have visitors taste their finest dishes as well as simple dishes adapted to the mass\u00ad consumption market. \u25a01 CDI Contact: Paul Chotard propose a range of judiciously chosen products. A work session organised by CDI after the fair confirmed the genuine market interest for these ethnic products.

In addition to certain steps already taken, CDI is examin\u00ad ing the methods to help some companies adapt their products to European tastes \u00ad the impera\u00ad tive search for ease in preparing dishes will often require that changes be made to recipes. CDI also provides assistance in bringing their products up to European hygiene and legal standards. It enables them to work on packa\u00ad ging and labelling to enhance the exotic character of the products and highlight their origin.

To stimulate and expand this sector, CDI mo\u00ad bilised financial means joined with those of other support procedures to Eur\u00ad opean Union projects: Sys\u00ad min and the FACT Fund. Sysmin The goal set by CDI is to set up a framework agreement with Sysmin to reinforce support to the Namibian mining sector. The financing agreement for Sysmin was concluded in March 1993 be tween the Republic of Namibia and the EU, in the context of the Lom\u00e9 IV Convention and the 7th European Development Fund. The programme aims to reverse the unfavourable course of activities in the mining sector, and to consolidate and im prove employment and economic activity levels in the sector. With CDI and Sysmin sup port, a portfolio of 12 mining pro jects has been carried out since 1997. The cooperation between CDI and Sysmin can be qualified as fruitful, to the extent that a similar proce dure is underway in the Dominican Republic. The FACT Fund The FACT Fund, created by the European Commission (DG VIM) and approved by CDI in late 1996, has the objective of supporting the development of ACP companies hav ing taken part in one of the sectoral meetings organised by the EU. The sectors concerned by the FACT Fund are agri-business in West Africa, construction materials in Central Africa and mining products in SADC, ECOWAS and UDEAC countries. Since 1997, 48 projects have bene fited from the fund, with co-finan cing from CDI. Two mining projects in Na mibia perfectly illustrate the colla boration among CDI, Sysmin and the FACT Fund: Okurusu Fluorite Mining Co. Ltd. and Peralin Limestone. Okurusu Fluorite Mining Co. Ltd This company, whose current investment is \u20ac4 million, operated a Fluorite mining with Solvay at the Okurusu mine Calcium carbonate production at Peralin fluorite quarry. Fluorite is a mineral with high value and is mainly used to produce fluorhydric acid. Monthly production is 2500 tons. Solvay, a European partner, buys Namibian fluorite for the South African and European markets. Okurusu is now mastering the know-how of extract ing and producing fluorite. On the other hand, the company wishes to rationalise the operation of its quar ries. In this context, CDI, Sysmin and the FACT Fund financed the geolo gical studies and the topographical surveys that led to the development of an operation plan for the quar ries. The environmental aspect was given particular consideration. Addi tionally, CDI, Sysmin and the FACT Fund financed a management train ing programme for the implementa tion of the mining plan. Peralin Limestone Peralin Limestone operates a limestone quarry whose product is destined for the industrial produc tion of calcium carbonate. This raw material has local and regional de mand for the production of paints and glues. CDI Sysmin and the FACT Fund jointly financed the analyses of raw materials, the research for ade quate transformation processes and the on-site assembly of the unit. Currently, in addition to support in training personnel, Peralin Lime stone benefits from support for the creation and application of quality control procedures.

        "cdi p a r t n e r s h ip Madagascar - biological products Phael Flor: production of biological essential oils 'Biological products' teem with ad vantages, in terms of both their growing and marketing potential. For nearly five years, CDI has been assisting a company in this sector. Created in 1985 and located in Antananarivo, Phael Flor collects, grows and distils plants to produce and export essential oils destined for the cosmetics industry. The produc tion and export of conventional, oleoresinous and concentrated es sential oils is carried out from ger aniums, pepper, cinnamon, camphor, ginger, vanilla, tag\u00e8te, cloves, etc. Given the recent competition from other countries for products such as cloves and black pepper, Phael Flor decided to explore other products, notably biologically grown plants for aromatherapy, cosmetics and specialised food industries. Having understood the sector's interest in biological products, Phael Flor be gan producing extracts of biologi cally certified aromatic plants. The total investment value is estimated at more than \u20ac300,000, and turn over in 1998 amounted to more than \u20ac200,000, largely due to the company's penetration of the North American market. Phael Flor em ploys over 50 people and is begin ning to diversify its product line. It is a member of Promabio, a profes sional association of Malagasy pro ducers and exporters of products made from biologically grown plants. CDI assistance in the bio sector The 'Biological Products' workshop organised in September 1996 by CDI and GTZ in Mauritius, in the context of the Coleacp semi nar devoted to horticultural pro ducts in the Indian Ocean region, led to the conclusion that, if the sector for products made from bio logically grown plants is a growing and evolving one, the ACP producers of such products still have insuffi cient knowledge of importers' re quirements, leading products and, in some cases, a lack of experience in biological agriculture. This workshop served as a catalyst and created genuine awareness of the biological sector in Madagascar. For more than four years now in Madagascar, the presence of a certification body for biologi cally grown products has helped the Malagasy producers become familiar with the market's requirements and constraints. The European, American and Japanese markets demand in creasing quantities of these pro ducts. Madagascar can satisfy part of this demand on the condition that it proves itself capable of con trolling its export products in terms of both quantity and quality. The recurring presence at fairs such as Biofach in Germany reinforces the experience of companies that exhibit there and the confidence of buyers. Indeed, exhibiting one's goods for a number of years leads to a certain degree of recognition in the profes sion. The stakes for assisting Madagascar Madagascar is ahead of the four Indian Ocean islands in terms of developing biological agriculture, and there is good reason to main tain this lead. The stakes are high Farmers bring their harvest to an artisanal still on the Malagasy high plateaux because it is necessary to consolidate the importers' image of Madagascar as a country where deadlines are met and where specifications, packa ging requirements, etc. are re spected. In addition to technical and financial assistance for Malagasy companies taking part in trade fairs, CDI can be called upon to contribute to the training of field workers and those involved in processing. Be cause it requires considerable amounts of manual labour, biologi cal agriculture must be supported in Madagascar; the farmers thus con tribute to protecting and conserving soil, respecting and maintaining bio diversity, setting up anti-erosion plans, managing water rationally and ensuring soil fertility through the use of composted fertilisers, etc. New CDI interventions Phael Flor has previously benefited from a number of CDI interventions: participation in the 'Essential Oils' congress in Istanbul in October 1995, participation in the CDI 'Biological Products' workshop in September 1996 in Mauritius, participation in the Biofach fairs in 1997 and 1998 and the training of a production manager at AFSO Grasse in October 1997. Phael Flor's partici pation in the Biofach fairs enabled the company to increase its sales and, in doing so, double its turnover as well as diversify its product line to include aromatherapy products. Perspectives are as follows: participation in Biofach 1999, expan sion of the product range (particu larly extracts for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries), identifi cation of additional production means to be determined by con tracts (qualitative and quantitative market requirements), definition of market trends in order to orient and establish the 1999 short-term pro duction programme. The growing success of Phael Flor justifies the renewed efforts CDI has made to assist this very active company as well as the biological agriculture sector as a whole.

        "A u s t r i a, a n ew CDI p a r t n er Having joined the European Union, Austria quickly took part in the activities launched by the Community, including those of CDI. In this context, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber organised a meeting in Vienna to inform more than 30 companies on CDI objectives and activities, accompanied by the publication of an information brochure. This brochure presents CDI, its goals, its work methods and the opportunities it provides to Austrian companies. In addition, the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs agreed to co-finance joint programmes proposed by CDI. This commitment was made in 1996 when the Minister signed a protocol to this effect. An Austrian representative has been a member of the CDI Board of Directors since 1998. Austria and Ghana/Zimbabwe Industrial twinning programme The Austria and Ghana/Zimbabwe Industrial Twinning Programme is one of the first programmed activities stemming from the aforementioned protocols. It was jointly launched by CDI, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs. The programme's objective is to enable SMEs in the industrial sector in Ghana and Zimbabwe to conclude a development project with an Austrian partner active in the same industrial sub-sector. This cooperation aims to go further than the customer- supplier relationship and create various forms of partnership (for example, financial or technical) so as to improve both partners' market position by facilitating their market entry and by establishing a close working relationship between the participating companies. The programme is open to all industrial sectors; priority is nonetheless given to the steel industry, mechanical sub-contracting, agri-business, plastics, wood, construction materials and leather. These are sectors where the production control and work methods need to be improved. The programme aims to create a minimum of 15 The wood sector is one of the Austria/Zimbabwe industrial twinning programme's priorities industrial partnerships between companies from Austria, Ghana and Zimbabwe.

SIDA and CDI will cooperate in Sweden as well as in ACP countries. The document, signed following a working mission in December 1998 by Mr. Matos Rosa, Deputy Director of CDI, provides for (1) the financing and coordination of promotional activities in Sweden to present the range of CDI instruments available to support development in ACP countries; (2) the identification of potential Swedish partners for ACP business projects eligible for CDI assistance and the identification of Swedish technical resources (technical experts, test centres, training organisations) for setting up eligible projects; (3) the joint organisation of programmes of events in ACP countries as well as joint assistance from CDI and Swedish institutions for the develop ment of activities in Sweden that have objectives related to those of CDI; (4) the joint financing of CDI interventions and programmes. The agreement will generate concrete results from the joint efforts of CDI with the SwedFund (Swedfund International AB) and SIDA. Under the name of SIDA-CDI Alliance Programme, initiatives are being prepared. Hi CDI Contact: Orlando Perez Diaz CDC: meeting on venture capital funds This seminar was held on January 29, 1999, in London by the CDC (Commonwealth Development Corporation). In addition to certain members of the EDFI (European Development Finance Institutions), it brought together the EIB (European Investment Bank), the Inter-American Development Bank and international commercial banks. Various subjects were discussed. First, CDC's unique experience was presented as it is considered to be a pioneer in creating and managing venture capital funds in developing countries (15 funds created between 1992 and 1999, of which 11 are in ACP countries, with total funding of \u20ac350m). Next, the economic impact of these funds was discussed, along with the evolution of investments, their profitability and problems encountered in the venture capital context. The participants also examined the experience of other financial development institutions and members of the EDFI (DEG in Germany, Swedfund in Sweden and Proparco in France). Particular attention was paid to the lessons to be learned from these eight years of experience and to new investment approaches in the countries concerned, as well as to complementary financial instruments to be set up in order to optimise the impact of venture capital funds. Finally, there was a focus on CDI's expanding role in constituting new venture capital funds (financial assistance in the setting up and managing of such funds). ",

The Finnish authorities and institutions met by delegates were the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the FINNFUND (Finnish Development Finance Institution) and the Confederation of Industries and Employers. CDI signed a formal cooperation agreement with the first three. The CDI delegation's main objective was to re\u00adlaunch coopera\u00ad tion with Finland. Wood is the designated key sector as it is a field in which Finnish companies are very active and in which various types of cooperation with ACP countries could be organised. The delegation also discussed the possibility of organising an information seminar on CDI in June in Finland. The possibility of developing an industrial twinning programme between Finnish and ACP companies was also raised. ^B CDI Contact: Orlando Perez Diaz Leather sector: partnership meeting in Ethiopia From March 2\u00ad6, 1999, CDI and ICE (Italian Institute of Foreign Trade) jointly organised an industrial partnership meeting in Ethiopia on the tanning sector. Finalised with the Ethiopian and Italian tanning associations, the programme involved seven visits to tanneries, including individual negotiations with a view to establishing partnerships. A workshop on quality control, certification and marketing brought together 130 participants. Its objective was to make Ethiopian companies aware of the requirements and functioning of the export market for finished and semi\u00adfinished leather goods. It also encouraged the active participation of experts and qualified technicians, as well as European companies likely to share their marketing knowledge with potential Ethiopian partners. The primary objective of the Ethiopian tanneries is to improve their finished\u00adproduct production capacity, be it for the domestic market or for export to the EU and other foreign markets. To contribute to this, the Ethiopian government issued a liberal investment code, with specific incentives and appro\u00ad priate administrative procedures. The Italian participants have already drawn up some plans of response that will involve calling upon CDI. A first follow\u00adup programme involves at least five cases of CDI assistance on the basis of protocols of agreement signed between Ethiopian and Italian companies. I CDI Contacts: Anani Adade and Paolo Baldan Mission to Ireland On February 7 and 8, 1999, Mr Matos Rosa, Deputy Director of CDI, visited Dublin to meet the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs to discuss the re\u00adlaunching of CDI activities with Irish partners. Numerous possibilities were covered. Meetings were also held with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Geological Survey of Ireland.

For these companies, the Spanish firms intend, above all, to reinforce their technical and economic performance to export blocks and competitive transformed products either to the region or to the USA, which represents a large market. Six projects will be the object of particularly close CDI support. The Sysmin representa\u00ad tives in the Dominican Republic demonstrated great interest in the CDI process of supporting companies in the mining sector. As a consequence, Sysmin is ready to support, together with CDI, projects in this sector in the Dominican Republic. This support could reach a dozen or so companies over a period of two to three years. Sysmin asked CDI to propose a framework agreement linking the two bodies. \u25a0 CDI Contact: Sid Boubekeur Guinea\u00adBissau Accompanying a mission from the European Commission, Mr Matos Rosa visited Bissau on March 31 for a day of work with the authorities of Guinea\u00adBissau.

CDI, in the context of its programme on construction materials, presented an exhibit entitled 'Building with Compressed Earth\u00ad en Blocks (CEB)' carried out by CRATerre\u00adEAG. Numerous copies of the CEB guide and other publications issued by CDI were distributed. CDI, together with its antenna (IDIL) and the National Mining Management organised a workshop to present CDI and its promotional activities in the CEB sector.

Whereas in the past donors have funded a large number of standalone projects, they are increasingly adopting a broad sector approach to agricultural development. This change in the management of development programmes comes at a time when poverty reduction objectives are receiving increasing emphasis. What opportunities are presented for agriculture by the advent of the sector approach for addressing poverty? What features of sector programmes are particularly pertinent to poverty reduction? And what are the main practical limitations to the approach? These questions were explored at a three-day workshop held at CTA in Wageningen, the Netherlands, in November 1998, which was jointly organised by CTA and DG VIII/A/1. Participants included senior policy makers from eastern and southern Africa and several EU Member States. I From projects to I sector programmes In the past, donors have assisted the agricultur al sector by funding stand-alone projects or area-based rural devel opment programmes with their own budgets and administrative structures. Experience has shown that there were serious limitations to this approach. The number of projects has proliferated, adding to the multiplicity of objectives and the complexity of manage ment procedures. From the point of view of poverty reduction, the project approach was unhelpful. Independent consultant.

Fax E-mail Website: (31) 317 467100 (31) 317 460067 cta@cta.nl www.cta.nl The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) was established in 1983 under the Lom\u00e9 Convention between the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) Group of States and the European Union Member States. CTA's tasks are to develop and provide services that improve access to information for agricultural and rural development, and to strengthen the capacity of ACP countries to produce, acquire, exchange and utilise informa tion in these areas. Project proposals tended to be driven by donors without giving due regard to the recipient gov ernment's capacity and willingness to sustain them. Furthermore, not enough attention was given to linking projects to national devel opment objectives and strategies or to taking into account policy and institutional weaknesses that undermined sector performance. In response to this experi ence with project management, several governments in eastern and southern Africa are preparing agricultural sector programmes. These are ambitious programmes that cover all public expenditure in the sector, and support all the activities, policy and institutional issues that are the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. Gov ernments are expected to be very much in the driving seat of the process, and take prime responsi bility for defining strategies, poli cies and activities. Donors are ex pected to play a more supporting role, coordinating closely in the appraisal and monitoring of the programmes. Opportunities and constraints One of the key messages to emerge from the workshop is that agricultural sector pro grammes offer considerable po tential as an instrument to tackle poverty. This is because they are comprehensive, and aim to reori ent the core activities of the Ministry of Agriculture concerned. They require the whole sector to be surveyed, and resources to be allocated according to overall prio rities and objectives. In addition, they focus attention on policy and institutional issues that have a large bearing on poverty reduc tion. Despite this potential, many workshop participants felt that the existing proposals for agricultural sector programmes have not taken sufficient account of poverty reduction objectives. Instead, they have focused on growth, privatisation and limiting public expenditure. This does not mean that sector programmes are unsuitable for poverty reduction: rather, it points to the need to make poverty reduction a more explicit programme objective at the outset, to mainstream poverty concerns into all aspects of pro gramme design and to avoid the possible pitfalls of the sector ap proach. The workshop participants identified a number of weaknesses with regard to the first generation of agricultural sector programmes, including lack of local ownership, the dominance of the public sector and the risk of reinforcing the top down tendency. Another concern was that agricultural sector pro grammes are too narrowly fo cused, and do not address the many non-agricultural constraints on rural livelihoods, such as land tenure insecurity, the absence of off-farm employment, and the lack of basic health and education services. In view of these limita tions, the sector approach is only likely to be successful where gov- t the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "ernments are committed to the process, maintain high standards of public financial management, are free of corruption and are responsive to all their constituen cies. Governments should also be willing to enter into partnerships with other agents in rural devel opment, and attempt to coordi nate development programmes in different sectors. Where these con ditions are in place, the sector approach represents a consider able advance on traditional pro ject management. The challenge now is to develop guidelines to focus agricultural sector pro grammes more closely on poverty reduction. Making strategic choices In order to devise poverty focused programmes, policy ma kers must first devise a coherent poverty reduction strategy. There are many strategic choices to be made, and trade-offs to be con fronted. Policy makers may decide to pursue a strategy of maximising growth of production or focusing on target groups of poor farmers. It is difficult to know which strat egy will be more effective in tackling poverty. Long-lasting pov erty reduction cannot occur with out growth but experience has shown that the benefits of growth do not always trickle down to the poor. Directing resources at target groups can make an impact on the livelihoods of the poor. However, targeted programmes are expen sive, and divert resources away from opportunities to increase growth that may deliver longer- lasting reductions in poverty. Furthermore, it is very difficult to achieve perfect targeting, and the intended beneficiaries are some times missed. It is notable that the proposals for agricultural sector programmes contain very few pov erty-targeted activities, and have been designed principally around growth objectives. Policy makers must also decide whether to invest in high potential areas or low potential areas. High potential areas are those where investment is likely to generate the highest returns, and tend to be fertile, accessible and well watered. Governments have often chosen to direct the lion's share of public resources to such areas, and this choice is reflected in the design of some agricultural sector programmes. However, this strategy may not always be the correct one. Re sources can often be mobilised through the private sector in high potential areas, and public invest ment may not be appropriate. There are strong arguments for increased public investment in low potential areas, where the private sector is often less devel oped. Low potential areas can offer good investment opportu nities, such as livestock production, soil and water conservation mea sures, and infrastructure to pro vide better access to markets. Furthermore, public spending in these areas is very likely to reach the poor because the majority of the population in low potential areas is often below the poverty line. The workshop discussed many other strategic choices which can only be listed here, for reasons of space. Smallholders or commer cial farmers? Capital or labour intensive production? High inputs or low inputs? Food crops or cash crops? High food prices or low food prices? Export orientation or Woman hoeing in northern Cameroun. Policy makers must decide whether to invest in high potential areas or low potential ones food self-sufficiency? The strategy for the sector programme should address all of these choices expli citly, and should consider the im plications of each for poverty re duction. In many cases the choice is not clear-cut, and a balanced strategy is desirable. For example, a growth-based strategy should be combined with some poverty-tar geted activities, and investment should be directed at both high potential and low potential areas. The position of this balance needs to be determined by careful ana lysis, and should be informed by public debate. Key policy issues Agricultural sector pro grammes are expected to support far reaching changes in agricultur al policies. The main thrust of these reforms is in the provision of public services. Governments are expected to restrict service provision to areas that would not normally be provided by the pri- the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 I ",
        "eta b u l l e t in vate sector, the so-called 'public goods'. These include services, such as disease and pest control, research into food crops and the regulation and quality control of input markets, which benefit a large number of people. Other services that confer exclusive ben efits on the farmers who receive them, such as artificial insemina tion and livestock dipping, are expected to be privatised or com mercialised. Governments may withdraw services, or contract them out to NGOs, private compa nies and other service providers. Cost recovery will also be widely introduced. These reforms are likely to have some negative consequences for poor farmers. Poor farmers may be unable to afford service charges, particularly where compe tition is weak, and private provi ders can achieve a monopoly posi tion. Private sector development is also unlikely to occur in remote areas because of the high trans port costs, lack of information and unusually high risks. However, there may also be some positive consequences of the reforms for poor farmers. Private sector service providers can prove to be more responsive to the needs of the poor. It must be remembered that publicly provided services do not have a good record in the agricul tural sector, particularly in reach ing poor farmers. The wealthier farmers tended to capture many of the private benefits of public ser vices, such as credit and input supply. The withdrawal of such services is unlikely to hurt the poor, and may allow a more efficient private sector to develop. Pursuing increased efficiency in agricultural service delivery should spur growth that will reduce pov erty in the long run. In spite of these benefits, it is clear that agricultural sector programmes are not primarily con cerned with poverty reduction, and their main purpose is to advance reforms in public service provision. The workshop partici pants agreed that there needs to be a recognition that public ser vices can be justified on the grounds of poverty reduction as well as public goods provision. There are many services, such as microfinance, that are not public goods, but are extremely relevant to poor farmers. There is a strong justification for including such ser vices in agricultural sector pro grammes. Agricultural sector pro grammes also need to ensure that the poor can benefit from private sector development, especially in remote areas. This will require more active measures to promote the development of an efficient private sector, such as the provi sion of infrastructure, information, regulation and possible financial incentives for private operators entering remote regions and new markets. Key institutional issues Public institutions will op erate very differently under agri cultural sector programmes. As part of a general process of de centralisation that is occurring in many eastern and southern Afri can countries, it is intended that much of the responsibility for the decision-making and management of agricultural sector programmes will be transferred to the local level. Local programmes will be devised in response to local needs. Because local government agen cies are in closer proximity to farmers, it is more likely that they will be able to tailor programmes to the needs of the poor. However, past experience of decentralisation has not always been positive. There is a critical lack of adminis trative capacity at the local level. Local authorities have not always proven to be accountable to their constituencies, and may be com promised by corruption. In prac tice, central government has often been reluctant to embrace real decentralisation, which requires giving up some control over policy making and the purse strings. It is also intended that agricultural sector programmes will be devised in participation with stakeholders. This offers a real chance to introduce greater accountability and openness into public institutions, and to identify poor people's own priorities and understanding. However, the case studies examined by the workshop found that there has not yet been much systematic stakeholder parti cipation in the formulation of agricultural sector programmes. It is likely that governments still feel some reluctance to embrace stake holder participation because it complicates the process of pro gramme formulation, and chal lenges the hierarchies of power and technical knowledge that have been the tradition of state- sponsored development pro grammes. Although the decision making process needs to be more closely linked to stakeholder parti cipation, there are some practical problems. Firstly, it is very difficult to ensure the participation of poor farmers, who often lack political organisation and have the weakest voice. There is a need to guard against powerful groups gaining undue influence over the decision making process, and to foster organisations of poor farmers to act as effective interest groups. Secondly, stakeholder participation cannot always provide policy an swers. It is a useful tool to identify stakeholder interests, particularly at the local level. However, these interests often conflict, and their resolution requires policy makers to make hard choices based on objective analysis and judgment. Information needs Designing agricultural sec tor programmes is a large and complex task that requires large amounts of information. There is a dearth of information on both poverty and agriculture for the formulation of agricultural policies in sub-Saharan Africa. Data fre quently have poor coverage, are of dubious quality, and even if they exist, are all-too-often poorly analysed. Bad data lead to bad policies and bad decisions, yet data collection and analysis often have low priority. Various types of data are required: information on institu tions and infrastructure, data on agro-economic and socio-cultural variables, and information on farming systems and the environ ment. The most appropriate way to collect these data depends on why the data are needed, the type and quality of data required, whether they already exist, how often updates are needed, and the costs of collecting and analysing them. Geographical information systems are a useful way of collat ing and analysing the information gathered. Participatory approaches as well as traditional surveys and remote-sensing techniques can be \u00ce the Courier n a 175 - may-june 1999 ",
        "e ta b u l l e t in used to gather data. Stakeholders at all levels should be involved in defining the objectives and im pacts of proposed policies in terms of the stakeholders' resources, constraints and needs, the interac tions among the different groups, potential conflicts among them, and their priorities and expecta tions. It is vital to have an accu rate profile of poverty in the country before devising a pro gramme. This should answer the questions of who the poor are (smallholders, pastoralists, women, minority groups etc.), where the poor live and what the main constraints on their livelihoods are. This profile should be based on quantitative measures of pov erty, such as consumption mea sures, and qualitative techniques, such as Participatory Rural Apprai sal. When the programmes are underway it is vital to provide regular reporting on changes in the poverty profile in order to understand which policies and ac tivities are having an impact on poverty. Unfortunately, information on poverty is often patchy and of questionable quality. There are many countries and regions in Africa where there are no data on poverty, and there are few countries where poverty is moni tored on a regular basis. Even where good data on poverty ex ists, it has often not been used Ghanaian smallholders harvesting rice on their plots. It is vital to have an accurate profile of poverty in the country before devising a programme effectively to inform development strategies. Greater investment in in formation is therefore essential to focusing agricultural sector pro grammes on poverty. While this may impose significant costs, a lack of information will impose far greater costs arising from mis conceived strategies, inappropriate policies and misallocated re sources. Poverty reduction as an explicit objective Agricultural sector pro grammes present an important opportunity to tackle rural pov erty. They embrace a broad range of policy, public expenditure and institutional issues that have a crucial bearing on poverty reduc tion. These issues cannot be ade quately addressed by standalone projects, and are better ap proached from the sector level. However, there are some shortcomings to existing proposals for agricultural sector programmes that need to be overcome. In particular, the proposals need to be broadened beyond the privati sation agenda, and should recog nise poverty reduction as an ex plicit objective to be main- streamed in all aspects of programme design. Programme management also needs to be come more participatory, and should be decentralised to local government and agencies outside the public sector. It is important to view agricultural sector programmes as a new and evolving instrument. The existing programmes are not a policy blueprint, but are a first attempt to improve the coherence of public policies, expenditures and institutions, and to achieve greater donor coordination in the sector. There is room for improve ment, and poverty concerns need to be brought more fully on board. This will require greater recognition of the importance of agricultural sector programmes for poverty reduction, and greater engagement in developing sector strategies for poverty reduction. The W a g e n i n g en w o r k s h op proved to be a valuable occasion to address these concerns. The workshop, which was entitled 'Reducing poverty through agricultural sector strategies in eastern and southern Africa', was organised by CTA and the Eur opean Commission's Directorate General for Development. It was attended by 34 participants, includ ing policy makers from Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, several European bilateral donors, staff of CTA and the European Commission and several specialist consultants. The workshop suc ceeded in bringing together donor and government perspectives, and was given a practical focus through the use of case study materials from Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda.

        "e t a - b u l l e t in Communication and the research institutions I Agricultural research in Africa is largely financed by public bodies, although the austerity measures imposed under structural adjustment plans has led to a falling-off in the proportion of research funding available from national resources. Furthermore, directors of producer organisations receiving support from donors pressurise those responsible for development and require research to demonstrate the impact of its results on improving the living conditions of rural populations. The authorities have increasing control over financial investment and, on a daily basis, have the power to approve or reject the strategic choices proposed for the economy, based on obtaining a balance between short-term and long-term investment. In such circumstances, research directors are increasingly called upon to enter into a dialogue with all those involved in research: communication is an essential instrument in planning and achieving institutional develop ment objectives, allowing better definition of research priorities, the setting-up of a cooperative research consor tium to guarantee the quality of results and the procure ment of financial support for research. This strategic role of communication in the modern management of institutions was the central topic in training sessions on public communication organised by the CTA in Dakar (Senegal) from 21 to 25 September 1998 and in Nairobi (Kenya) from 1 to 4 December 1998. These training courses were intended to enhance the communication capabilities of the directors of agricul tural research institutions in member countries of the CORAF (Conference of Agricultural Research Directors in Africa - West and Centre) and the ASARECA (Association for survivability of agricultural Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa). Participants were expected to develop greater awareness of the importance of communication in the development of their institution, to master oral expression techniques and to become familiar with the media (radio and television). The ASARECA's medium-term plan suggests, moreover, that national research institutions have to devel op a constant line of communication via which to enter into a dialogue with the principal sources of funding, focusing on those research programmes which will lead to an improvement in agricultural technology, with a view to achieving a quantifiable economic impact in the field. The courses organised by the CTA highlighted 'targeted' communication aimed at encouraging the in tended audience to adopt a certain innovation and to implement it. To help organisations manage their own image, teaching covered key aspects of quality oral communication: self-confidence, the ability to listen, clarity of expression and the ability to put one's views across. As regards communication strategy, teaching sessions concen trated on ongoing dialogue as a way in which to achieve a change in attitude on the part of a development institution. The CTA, therefore, is monitoring research organi sations to assess how they develop their communication skills in order to give their institutions a higher profile and to improve the image of research itself.

It is perfectly true that Project Cycle Management (PCM) incorpo\u00ad rates the basic logic that is behind the Logical Framework Approach (LFA), and I consider the latter to have been a decisive step forward when it was first conceived around 1970. Dr. Gasper is also right when he points out the weaknesses of LFA. He mentions 'lackframes' and 'lockframes' (terms coined by Dr Gasper that I used in my earlier article - he has accepted my apologies for not mentioning the fact!), and 'logic-less frames'. He uses this last expression when referring to the establishment of the LFA matrix, in a retro-fitting exercise, in cases where external funders demand it. I know this comes close to a quibble, but I should like to call such matrixes 'lickframes' - as the recipient either plays up to the donor or tries to delude him. We could then call 'luckframes' those matrixes that have been retro-fitted onto pre-existing project designs with\u00ad out malice These are designs that may or may not fit the rigorous logic of LFA but if they do, it is largely by chance. I agree with Dr Gasper as well when he points to the fact that one cannot 'jam' too much sub\u00ad stance into a four-level, one-page diagram. In reality, we are dealing with a 'continuum' that starts with simple, deterministic pieces of ac\u00ad tivity: for instance, the transport of a load of bricks to a building site, moving on to simple projects, then more complicated ones, to programmes and policies and end\u00ad ing up with the ultimate aim of all ethical human endeavour which we might call 'human dignity for all'. This last objective may be unreachable but it is worth striv\u00ad ing for. So, the LF matrix will always be too simple ('lackframe') and will frequently tend to be fixed and not updated ('lock- frame'). LFA has no answer to counteract this clash between the nature of the instrument (the LF matrix) and real life situations, but PCM has: avoiding, at the same time, 'jamming' when it comes to defining always and without any exception, the objectives of any project, programme or policy in terms of 'sustainable benefits for the target group' (see 'Terms of Reference' below). Again, Dr Gasper is right, I think, when he underlines that pluralistic views and open or hidden dis\u00ad agreements between development cooperation partners are sub\u00ad merged by donors telling every\u00ad body what's what instead of lis\u00ad tening and learning. Yet, I don't think that anybody on the donor or the recipient side can possibly find fault with 'sustainable bene\u00ad fits for the target group' as the common objective - declared from the w o rd ' g o' and present t h r o u g h o ut the project/pro\u00ad gramme/policy cycle. If they do, they must have 'hidden agendas' which may be explainable, but are not excusable. There can be no doubt that 'tun\u00ad nel vision' is a real danger that flows from confusing the me\u00ad chanics of the LF matrix with real life, putting product before pro\u00ad cess. Yet, underlining the impor\u00ad tance of a distinction between activities, results, purpose, goal, indicators and assumptions has been essential in combating muddled thinking in project/pro\u00ad gramme preparation, implementa\u00ad tion and evaluation, and that is the main merit of LFA. But to forget that improving the human condition cannot be planned by blueprints is really unforgivable. I have a lot of sympathy, too, for Dr Gasper's discussion of the 'tar\u00ad get group'. Frankly, I hate the expression and employ it only because everybody else does (which is no convincing reason). I would much prefer 'intended ben\u00ad eficiaries'. Target groups seem to be made to stand against a wall to be 'shot at', albeit in a friendly fashion, by a project 'for their own good'. To change metaphors, if they 'swallow the medicine', that is called 'participation'. How pa\u00ad tronising can you get? To sum up, if I had any doubts left about the failure of LFA to serve as a project design instrument 'up\u00ad front', Dr Gasper has shattered them. However, LFA conserves all its value as: (a) a powerful reference frame to avoid muddled thinking; (b) an efficient checking instru\u00ad ment (if you cannot draw up a logframe with closed eyes having established your feasibility study, for example, you may be sure that you have to go back to the drawing board! But even if you can, the logframe may present only part of the whole picture... beware of 'tunnel vision'!), and; (c) an instrument allowing the establishment of a convenient summary overview. However, if Dr Gasper puts LFA, ZOPP and PCM into the same basket, I cannot, with all respect, agree because he keeps silent about three absolutely essential points that distinguish the very nature of PCM from that of LFA and ZOPP. Indeed, he mentions the first and the second PCM principles but not the third! It goes without saying that the respect of the decision\u00ad making discipline along the six project cycle phases (principle 3) is as important as the definition of the project purpose in terms of sustainable benefits for the target group (principle 1) and the need to observe all the essential criteria along the project cycle (princi\u00ad ple 2). the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",
        "t he c o u r i e r 's m a i I b a g He does not highlight, as is essen tial in PCM, the Terms of Refer ence - in other words, the me chanism that allows PCM to pass from the barren, highly concise and concentrated contents of the 'Basic Format' and the 'Format of Phases and Decisions' to the ever- changing, evasive complexity of real life situations. And, finally, he does not underline the need to apply PCM to its own introduction into a given organisa tion, which may leave some ob servers under the erroneous im pression that merely by teaching LFA (or PCM, for that matter), projects, programmes and policies will become more effective. Alas, they do not! I have let Dr Gasper see and comment on this letter. Before I sent it to the editor, I incorporated those of his remarks with which I agree. I hope that he and others interested in this important subject (and that includes, of course, Courier readers) will continue the debate and thus contribute to the never-ending effort to turn devel opment cooperation into a more effective means of helping people to help themselves.

Request for economic indicators I must commend the Courier team for work well done in producing the bi-monthly magazine which is very informative as far as ACP countries are concerned. I would like, however, to suggest the following: Once or twice a year, the magazine should publish summarised standings of the eco nomic status of the ACP countries with information about matters such as income per capita, birth rates, fertility rates, number of doctors per 1000 inhabitants, eco nomic growth etc. This informa tion would help us judge the performance of the various ACP countries in terms of their eco nomic development. Furthermore, it will indicate to readers which economic reforms are actually working and in what countries. Publishing these stand ings would help those involved in implementing the reforms to gauge their performance in rela tion to other ACP countries. Andrew Frederick Meya, Kampala, Uganda. Ed. We are aware that a lot of readers would be interested in a service of this kind, but it is not really feasible in a publication like The Courier, for logistical reasons. Even supplying the basic informa tion suggested, for 71 countries, would occupy a considerable amount of space in the magazine. Collating data supplied from so many different sources would also be very time-consuming. The EC Commission's annual report on ACP-EU cooperation goes some way towards meeting Mr Meya's request in providing eight basic indicators for each ACP country. We should also mention the UNDP's annual Human Develop ment Report which contains much more detailed statistical informa tion about the social and econom ic situation in all countries. A view from Belize on the banana dispute I am writing to you in connection with the ongoing dispute over the European Community's banana re gime, following the announce ment by the US that it would impose unilateral trade sanctions on the EU. The US insists that its quarrel is with the EU, not the Caribbean, insultingly ignoring the adverse effects of its economic warfare policies on the small de fenceless states in our region. By doing this, the US and its allies not only oppose the EU, but also threaten to strangle the poor Caribbean states, including Belize. It is important to look at certain statistics in order to appreciate the great inequity that prevails. The three large companies. Chiquita (which has donated substantial sums to American political parties), Del Monte and Dole control two- thirds of the world banana market as opposed to only 8% for Car ibbean producers. Caribbean coun tries pay average wages of $12.50 per day per employee compared to $3.50 in Latin countries. The industry is very labour-intensive (labour represents 40% of total costs). Consequently, the Carib bean would not be able to com pete with its Latin neighbours. Of the EU banana imports from Latin America and the ACPs, the former accounts for 92% of the total. It seems that the US is trying to cut into the remaining 8%, supplied mainly by the Caribbean. The banana war is an issue of life and death for Belize. Bananas generate 20% of our foreign ex change and provide a livelihood for more than 4000 people. What we have here is a defining issue for the new world order of global integration. The big question is whether poor economies will have any place in this new order. If the US wins the banana war, then we could see an 'island hopping' strategy where Washington sys tematically moves against one in dustry after another. Bananas are the current victim: rice, citrus and sugar could be next on the list. We must be aware of this potential strategy. We believe that the new world order can and should accomodate everyone - even the small Carib bean countries which otherwise risk falling off the geopolitical map.

        "Romano Prodi nominated for Commission Presidency following mass resignation EU leaders moved quickly to fill the vacuum created by the recent resignation of all 20 members of the Eur opean Commission. The col lective decision to step down came after publica tion of a highly critical report by a committee of independent experts on a number of aspects of the institution's management. The committee was set up by the European Parliament following allegations of fraud and 'cronyism' within the Commission. Meeting in Berlin, the European Council (heads of government) nominated Romano Prodi (59) for the Commission Presidency. Mr Prodi was Prime Minister of Italy from May 1996 to October 1998, heading a centre-left coalition. At the time of going to press, the decision still had to be confirmed by the European Parliament. The length of Mr Prodi's proposed term of office was also unclear. According to press reports, many MEPs wanted only an interim Commission President at this stage - to take the helm until the end of 1999 (when the previous Commis sion's mandate would normally have expired). European elections are due in June, and the argument is that the newly-elected chamber should have the task of confirming who will head the next Commis sion (in office from 2000-2004). The Council, meanwhile, was said to favour appointing Mr Prodi for a full term, on the basis that this would bring much-needed stabi lity. A new phase in South Africa-EU relations After 3 1 /2 years of highly complex negotiations, EU leaders have ap proved the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement be tween the EU and South Africa. The agreement provides for the establishment of a Bilateral Free Trade Area between the two sides in conformity with WTO rules, and the strengthening of European development assistance to South Africa beyond 1999. EU chief ne gotiator, Professor Jo\u00e3o de Deus Pinheiro, welcomed the decision of the EU Council, underlining that this is the beginning of a new phase in EU-South Africa relations and that it would pave the way for the future partnership with the ACP countries. Professor Pinheiro said: 'the out come of this process is of great historical significance. After dec ades of isolation during the apart heid period, the agreement seals the new political, economic and development relationship between the EU and South Africa. It con firms and strengthens the EU's role as the first amongst South Africa's partners, and opens up new op portunities for South Africans and Europeans alike.' He underlined the contribution the deal would make to economic growth and political stability in Southern Afri ca. The decision by the European Council ends weeks of intense contacts between Professor Pin heiro and his South African coun terpart, Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin. Subject to completion of the for mal procedures, including ap proval by the European Parlia ment, the agreement could be signed within months and enter into force in 2000. Summit preserves huge tracts of African forest Six million hectares of forest in Central Africa have been ear marked for preservation thanks to a new agreement signed by five African countries. At a summit in Yaound\u00e9 in March, the leaders of Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Gui nea, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo committed their governments to a number of initiatives aimed at conserving and sustainably managing large tracts of tropical forest in the Congo Basin. The plan includes commit ments by international donors. both public and NGO (notably the World Bank and the WWF). The EU is already Central Africa's main partner in the field of en vironmental protection and the revised Fourth Lom\u00e9 Convention includes a protocol dealing speci fically with tropical forests. Pro grammes developed in this context include 'forest eco-systems in Cen tral Africa' and 'The future of the peoples of the tropical forests' (APFT). Obasanjo visits Brussels Nigeria's President-elect, General Olusegun Obasanjo, stopped off in Brussels (23 March) on his world tour, to meet Belgian businesspeo ple and the Nigerian diaspora. His two priorities were to re-establish Nigeria within the international business community and to encou rage the country's expatriates to take a renewed and active interest in their homeland. Recognising that there is still much to be done to achieve economic reform and good governance, General Obasanjo thanked Belgian businesses already established in Nigeria for their continued good faith. For others potentially inter ested in his country, he pledged a series of measures to create a sound and stable environment for investment and growth. He said his top priorities were to root out corruption, introduce transpar ency, develop good governance at all levels, reform institutions (including the legislature) and generally create a secure environ ment within which to foster busi ness and economic growth. Inward investment would be welcomed in all sectors - primary, manufactur ing and tertiary - even for new service sectors such as tourism. However, General Obasanjo under lined that while wishing to facil itate foreign investment, this would not be at the expense of the Nigerian people. Decisions ta ken on a number of recent priva tisations were on hold pending the assumption of power by his administration. On the Niger Delta, the General promised a comprehensive master plan to address the complex issues - including local peoples' demands for a greater share in the oil benefits, and investment in the the Courier n\u00b0 175 - may-june 1999 1 ",

Common foreign and security policy declarations The Presidency of the European Union has recently issued the following declarations in the con\u00ad text of the CFSP Burundi - the Arusha peace process Declaration of 18 March 1999 The EU welcomes the continuing talks within the Arusha peace process, intended to find a peace\u00ad ful solution to the conflict within Burundi. The EU considers this process as an essential option for reaching agreement. It has taken note of the resolve of the Govern\u00ad ment of Burundi, declared on several occasions, to conclude ne\u00ad gotiations successfully in 1999. The EU encourages all parties to con\u00ad tribute constructively to this goal and underlines that agreement must be based on their willingness to accept compromise. Regional states, by suspending their embargo against Burundi in January 1999, signalled their sup\u00ad port for the talks. Nevertheless, the EU is deeply concerned about reports of con\u00ad tinued violence by rebel groups and the security forces, causing numerous civilian victims. It ap\u00ad peals urgently to both sides to cease their acts of violence imme\u00ad diately. Several EU Member States and the European Commission are provid\u00ad ing financial support to the peace process. After nine months of negotiations, the EU urges the parties to organise the talks in a way that will help to achieve the desired result as soon as possible. On such a basis, the EU Member States and the European Commis\u00ad sion are willing to consider favour\u00ad ably further financial support and appeal to other donors to act likewise. The EU is providing substantial support to Burundi. In response to positive political steps and in order to promote development in Burundi, the EU has expressed its willingness to assist in a more long\u00adterm manner in socio\u00adeco\u00ad nomic rehabilitation and recon\u00ad struction. The EU underlines that such support is linked to successful pursuit and accomplishment of the peace process. Presidential elections in Nigeria Declaration of 3 March 1999 The EU welcomes the holding of presidential elections in Nigeria on 27 February 1999. These elections represent a significant step on the way to the installation of a demo\u00ad cratically elected civilian govern\u00ad ment after 15 years of military rule in Nigeria which will be ended by the handing\u00adover of power to the democratically elected civil presi\u00ad dent on 29 May 1999. The EU welcomes the fact that, according to reports from its observers, the voting procedures were held on the basis of a multi\u00ad party\u00adsystem and universal suf\u00ad frage and were based on demo\u00ad cratic principles. The EU congratu\u00ad lates the people of Nigeria on an election held in the spirit of open\u00ad ness, and which proceeded peace\u00ad fully. It appeals to all parties concerned to accept and honour the results that generally reflect the wish of the Nigerian people. The EU notes with satisfaction that, despite tight deadlines and difficult organisational conditions, the Independent Electoral Com\u00ad mission was able to organise the election in such a way as to enable the majority of Nigerian voters to express their will. However, a number of serious irregularities were encountered and should be investigated. The EU is aware that the newly elected President and his Government have a major task before them. The EU assures the Nigerian people and Government of its willingness to continue to promote political and economic reforms and its readiness to coop\u00ad erate with the elected authorities towards strengthening the rule of law, the respect of human rights and good governance in Nigeria. The EU hopes that the new Gov\u00ad ernment, in the interest of the entire country, will be able to succeed in reconciling all those who opposed each other in the past and will thus lead Nigeria to a better future and enable it to assume its due role in the interna\u00ad tional community of states and peoples. Commission approves humanitarian aid worth \u20ac13.5 million for Sudan The European Commission has ap\u00ad proved a package of humanitarian aid worth \u20ac13.5m for victims of conflict in Sudan. The aid, mana\u00ad ged by the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will provide support for about 30 pro\u00ad grammes (health, water, food se\u00ad curity) over the next year. Almost all of these are under the umbrella of Operation Lifeline Sudan, the United Nations framework for pro\u00ad viding aid to those affected by war in the country. Humanitarian needs in Sudan are likely to stay very high in 1999. Poor rains in December make the prospects for an adequate harvest in war\u00adaffected areas very bad. And analysts predict more military offensives, leading to further dis\u00ad placement of people with all the disruption that this implies. This is all set against the background of the cumulative effects of a war that has now dragged on for 15 years, in one of the poorest, least accessible regions in the world. About a third of the funds made available in this Global Plan will go to operations in government\u00ad controlled areas, and the rest to operations in areas controlled by the Sudan People's Liberation Army or other southern factions. ECHO has focused on areas in which people are believed to be in the greatest need and at great\u00ad est risk: Bahr el Ghazal, Unity State, Upper Nile, Jonglei. Pro\u00ad grammes emphasise basic primary health care, provision of clean drinking water and sanitation fa\u00ad cilities, and food security. Mi f the Courier n\u00b0 175 \u00ad may\u00adjune 1999 ",

        "Every day, large numbers of people travel into the capital from surrounding areas to sell their produce. Some come to the central market pictured here, others go to the district markets, while there are those who simply set up shop beside the road or at a junction. They offer everything from meat and nuts to homespun cloth. It is estimated that more than half of the population of N'djamena make their living in the informal sector. Images of Chad This Sahel country has many lakes which grow huge during the rains and then retreat under the hot sun of the dry season, leaving behind muddy waters. In Fianga and elsewhere, the scene is dominated by the birds... and the fishermen. Whether they are casting their lines from pirogues, or fishing from the banks, balanced on an upturned gourd, they make an arresting sight. \u00ab ^\u25a01 ^H^| ",
