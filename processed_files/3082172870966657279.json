        "6 Boosting jobs: The Contribution of European Research Setting the Scene Creating jobs and reducing unemployment remains a priority for the European Union. Despite the recent strengthening of economic activity progress in the labour market is still modest. The consequences of the financial and economic crisis on employment are yet to be fully addressed. Between 2008 and 2013 the (seasonally adjusted) unemployment rate in the EU-28 increased from 7.0% to 10.8%. More recent Eurostat figures show that since then the situation has improved with the seasonally adjusted rate sitting at 9.5% in July 2015. This translates to approximately 24 million unemployed across Europe, of whom 50% are now long-term unemployed (more than 12 million people or 5% of the active population). At the same time, the situation is very different among Member States. In 2014 the level of unemployment varied from 5.0% in Germany and 5.6% in Austria to 24.5% in Spain and 26.5% in Greece. The hardest hit include young workers, those in low skilled jobs and people in more precarious working conditions. The deterioration in the labour market situation has had an effect on poverty and social exclusion. In 2013, 122.6 million people, or 24.5 % of the population in the EU-28, were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. As with employment, degrees of poverty and exclusion show significant divergence among Member States, with particularly high rates in Bulgaria (48.0 %), Romania (40.4 %), Greece (35.7 %), Latvia (35.1 %) and Hungary (33.5 %). While at the other end of the spectrum, the lowest shares were recorded in Sweden (16.4 %), Finland (16.0 %), the Netherlands (15.9 %) and the Czech Republic (14.6 %). In combination with the labour market trajectories there is thus a risk of a long term divide between better performing countries and those facing profound challenges. The European Commission has an important role to play in putting employment in a sustainable path and narrowing gaps between Member States. Growth and jobs are at the core of the Commission\u2019s agenda for the next 5 years, while President Juncker has made explicit his vision for achieving a \u00abSocial Triple A\u00bb. The Investment Plan will mobilise investments of at least \u20ac315 billion in three years. Additionally, the Commission announced a package of measures to support Member States in getting people, especially the long-term unemployed, into work and promote skills. ",
        "7 Setting the Scene DG Research and Innovation supports the Commission\u2019s policies towards boosting growth and employment. Having access to robust data and solid evidence is paramount for the design of effective policy. The EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Progarmme for research, technological development and demonstration activities and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme on Research and Innovation finance several research projects on (un) employment and job creation; labour market innovations; vulnerabilities of different groups of workers (youth, women, disabled, migrants); social exclusion and inequalities; quality of work and skills; institutional and social innovations; and policy learning concerning what works, where and why. This publication presents the most relevant projects in the Social Sciences and Humanities who have taken up the task of addressing the wider issues of employment, growth and inclusion. The projects are a source of ground breaking conceptual work, extensive quantitative comparisons and surveys, profound and in-depth qualitative forays into social challenges and importantly concrete, evidence-based policy recommendations.

In this context, Minimum Income Protection (MIP) is one of the main pillars of European welfare states. However, MIP recipients often suffer from multiple social problems. Thus, effective support for their social and labour market inclusion also requires individualised social service support. In COPE we investigated how five European countries (PL. SE, UK, IT, DE) deal with the organisational challenge of providing interlinked social and employment services. The core of COPE\u2019s analysis was to map poverty and social exclusion in Europe, to examine the complex governance structure of European, national and local policies of minimum income schemes, and to assess their impact on beneficiaries.

        "Project partners UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, UK UNIVERSITY OF MILAN, IT UNIVERSITY OF WARSWAW, PL LUND UNIVERSITY, SE OSLO AND AKERSHUS UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES, NO 13 FP7 projects Outcomes The results show that the five countries balance multiple goals and different logics, but lean towards one of two types of MIP: they either organise their MIP schemes at the national level, with a strong focus on employability and activation, but with little scope for social work (UK and Germany). Or \u2013 in Sweden, Poland and Italy - the role of MIP is to uphold the local social order by supporting those who are in need. Links to Active Labour Market Policies and Public Employment Services are weak and unsystematic. For local patterns of service integration, the project revealed a very mixed landscape, with cooperation structures ranging from very close links between MIP, unemployment protection and social service like in Dortmund (DE) to parallel systems of MIP and employment services, as for example in Glasgow (UK). Research at the street-level showed that successful individual support is of course also strongly influenced by financial and staff resources, both of which are often lacking in all systems. ",

In many European countries, however, political authority to formulate and implement social investment provisions rests with local governments (municipalities). The questions thus become: \u2022 Are EU ideas and policies adapted when and implemented by (national or) local governments? \u2022 To what extent do local social investment policies actually help women enter, re-enter or remain in the labour market throughout their life course? These research questions were at the heart of the FLOWS project. The study was based on in-depth analysis of eleven cities in eleven different countries. ",

This gap calls for new types of vertical governance and dialogue between different policy levels if EU policies are to become effective. The employment rate of mothers may be high, even though the provision of day-care institutions is low. This is only possible, however, if women accept part-time work or sometimes precarious jobs. Demand side factors framed by the local economy \u2013 rather than supply side oriented social investment \u2013 are of major importance for women\u2019s employment. High initial education is very important for women\u2019s employment. ",

However, the scope for these is frequently undermined by the central thrust of the neoliberal policy frame, and in particular of European marketization policies. The project argued that it is essential that public policymakers and business interests recognize that the negative externalities of uncertainty, insecurity, anxiety and declining trust that markets can create cannot be resolved through markets themselves - unaided by public policy. Therefore marketization increases rather than reduces the need for public policy and public resources that offset these negative consequences. Possibilities for doing this are undermined by the insistence of EU policy that social policy is just another area in which markets must operate, rather than one in which they should be counter-balanced.

It works to identify innovative policies and to analyse strategies of policy learning that facilitate the development and transfer of these innovations within and across European countries. Looking at labour markets from 2000 onwards, the project examines employment, social policies, and the qualitative and quantitative position of vulnerable groups, defined as groups that experience a higher risk of poverty and social exclusion than the general population. INSPIRES specifically focuses on the position in labour markets of young people (under 25), migrants, disabled people and older workers (over 55). It covers eleven countries from all European welfare traditions: Mediterranean, Eastern European, Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian and the continental regimes. The project intends to isolate the impact of national policies from the structural demographic, social and economic characteristics of labour market resilience. And to identify processes of policy learning and innovation that occur in the interactions between policy makers, politicians, non-profit organizations, trade unions, business associations and other stakeholders at the European, national and sub-national level.

It has showed that older workers have been able to maintain their employment positions in most countries, but at the expense of youth and migrant workers. INSPIRES has also identified significant differences in the distribution of the consequences of the crisis among different groups. The first analysis of policy learning indicates that the vast majority of policy innovations in the INSPIRES countries cannot be considered as responses to the crisis. Instead, they are part of long-term processes of risk prevention, activation, flexibilisation and adaption of governance structures. ",

Against the background of increasingly complex tasks and jobs, understanding how complex problem-solving skills impact individuals and organizations and how such skills can be supported has important policy implications. LLLight\u2019in\u2019Europe is based on a unique instrument that tests complex problem- solving skills, thus allowing for the first time evidence-based insights into the development of professional and learning paths of employed individuals and entrepreneurs and into the role that cognitive skills play. The analysis of these skills is enhanced through the contribution of experts from different disciplines: economists who analyse the impact of cognitive skills on wages and growth; sociologists who investigate how public policies can support the development of such skills and of lifelong learning in general; and innovation researchers who track the relationship between problem-solving skills, lifelong learning and innovation at organizational level in the highly- dynamic industry of agribusiness. The result is a multidisciplinary analysis of the process of learning and problem-solving in its different nuances and of the levers which can support the development of these elements for both those who are already employed and for those who are (re)entering the labour market.

By social cohesion policies, we mean policies aimed at achieving social inclusion and equal opportunities even for the most disadvantaged groups in society, especially with regard to labour market participation. LOCALISE focused specifically on the question how local public, private and non-governmental organisations deal with the challenge of achieving closer service coordination between different political levels, different types of service organisations, and different \u2013 often formerly separated \u2013 policy fields (in particular, social, employment and economic policy).

However, although some national employment systems in Europe already foresee such a link, this does not necessarily guarantee good implementation at the local level. The following key obstacles to effective local service coordination were identified by LOCALISE: \u2022 A lack of resources and/or opportunities to pool resources among organisations (due to heterogeneous targets and/or fragmented organisational landscapes), \u2022 No clear network leadership, no clear procedural rules, \u2022 No joint inter-organisational objectives (e.g. employability vs. broader social inclusion/\u2018life first\u2019), \u2022 A lacking autonomy of local public actors in service design.

The concentration of wage growth among high-skilled workers, combined with disproportionate job growth at the upper and lower ends of the skill distribution, has resulted in a more unequal economic environment. Rising demand at the upper and lower ends of the occupational skills distribution took place during the decade from 1998 to 2008. Job polarisation also occurred in 17 out of 25 EU countries between 2000 and 2010 and the trend is expected to continue if no measures to tackle it are taken. Simultaneously, NEUJOBS finds that with the expanding education sector we will see a continuing replacement of low-skilled workers by medium-skilled workers. This means that the medium-skilled might temporarily assume positions for which they are overqualified. The call for policy-makers therefore is to tackle polarisation, as it is likely to increase socio- economic inequalities within societies along lines of ethnicity, gender, age and skill. ",

They followed a three-phase research design: \u2022 a comparative institutional mapping and analysis of vocational and labour-market policies in all educational regimes \u2022 case studies to reconstruct the conceptions, aspirations and practices of local actors who implement educational and training programmes and of the young people who attend them \u2022 quantitative secondary analyses of national and European longitudinal data to reveal how effectively these strategies close the capability gap for young people.

The highest current rate of mobility can be found in Germany (19%), the lowest in Switzerland (13%). Circular mobility (about two thirds) is more frequent than relocation mobility (about one third). The most common form of mobility is long distance commuting. Higher rates of mobility can generally be found among young people, university graduates and men. Besides facilitating work-related mobility which is a worthwhile endeavour for several reasons, EU policymakers also have to address its potential negative consequences such as postponing family development, complicating social engagement and at times reducing subjective well-being.

The research also highlighted the role of institutional factors (education system, the family, the labour market regulation, the welfare state model, the type of capitalism) in drawing boundaries among age groups. With few differences among countries, the consortium identified three generations of workers which are diversely positioned in the labour market and which also show different work cultures and expectations. Young people (< 30) are more exposed to precariousness and unemployment but they benefit from positive educational and digital differential; they ask for more social protection and higher income but also for more freedom and opportunities of self- development. The adult generation (30 to 50) usually enjoys a stable position in the labour market but it is more exposed to the difficulties related with keeping together career expectations and family care. This generation asks for social and company support to better reconcile work and family but also for life-long learning measures. The elder generation (> 50) \u2013 when they are still at work \u2013 enjoy the best wages and security and the highest representation by trade unions but they are the most exposed in case of company restructuring because of deskilling.

The interaction between job quality and innovation is investigated as potentially mutually supportive. Job quality is a multi-dimensional concept covering various aspects of work organisation and the terms and conditions of employment. Drawing on the Oslo Manual, both technical and non-technical innovations are investigated, with an emphasis on organisational innovation. Through quantitative analyses and qualitative organization-level case studies, the factors and also the mechanisms and processes by which job quality and innovation impact each other are identified. The effects of this interaction between job quality and innovation are then analysed in terms of employment outcomes. The latter are then tracked in terms of their impact on social inclusion and inequality. ",

Its goal is to: understand what determines individual participation in international mobility (as a result of personal and professional development strategies); examine motives, migration channels and information sources; analyse individual outcomes in terms of employability and careers, but also non-economic terms; study the economic, demographic and cultural impacts on origin and destination regions; differentiate between short- term and long-term outcomes in terms of return migration and future intentions to migrate; and identify implications for migration, education and housing policies. The research will focus on 9 countries representing different contexts for youth mobility: Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, the UK, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Spain. The team will use existing secondary data for the whole of the EU, but will mainly rely on primary quantitative data (large- scale surveys) and qualitative data (interviews). The policy analysis will be informed by interviews undertaken with key informants. Experimental methods will be used to assess how individuals will respond to different scenarios of future economic and social change. ",

        "70 Boosting jobs: The Contribution of European Research An ever closer union among the peoples of Europe? - Rising inequalities in the EU and their social, economic and political impacts The Treaty on European Union is based on an \u2018ever closer union among the peoples of Europe\u2019. Scientific research in social sciences and the humanities funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme shows that socioeconomic inequalities have generally increased in the EU over the last 20 years. A dual trend in inequalities has been observed during periods of economic growth as well as since the onset of the financial and economic crisis in 2008. First, inequalities reinforce the exclusion of already fragile citizens, trap - ping them into lives of exclusion from an early age. This issue triggers many questions as to what models of economic policy the EU should adopt and how these models should be combined with stronger social policies in favour of inclusion and solidarity. Second, rising inequalities threaten the quality of our democracies in Europe. Democracies thrive on equal treatment, proper regard to merit and opportunities for the excluded and the poor to live better lives. To ensure these rights, the EU needs to develop and implement targeted public policies in areas such as education and employment. This publica - tion is aimed at supporting the agenda for jobs, fairness and democratic change put forward by Jean-Claude Juncker and the newly appointed European Commission. 2015, ISBN 978-92-79-39853-7, doi:10.2777/87868, 128 pages http://ec.europa.eu/research/social-sciences/pdf/policy_reviews/ki - na26814enc.pdf#view=fit&pagemode=none ",
        "71 Publications relevant to employment policy Their Future is Our Future: Youth as Actors of Change In the context of the changing demographic structure of society, Europe\u2019s future prosperity and sustainability largely depend on its ability to take advantage of the potential of all genera- tions. In times of economic and financial crisis in particular, Europe needs a strong young genera - tion to be a driver of sustainable and inclusive growth that will ensure long-term development. Youth represents the backbone of future Europe and we need to prepare the generation that will lead and support the EU in 2040 and after. This publication gives an overview of the most relevant projects on youth and youth-related po - licies. The results of these projects are highly relevant for the new Juncker Commission agenda on \u00abJobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change\u00bb, and in particular relevant for the EU Youth Strategy, as the research aims to ensure the full participation of youth in an innovative, inclusive, sustai - nable and democratic Europe. Thus, they provide solid suggestions as to how EU and national policies can most adequately address the challenges faced by young people today, and how to set the EU on a course for a better future.

        "72 Boosting jobs: The Contribution of European Research Time to Grow: Emerging Knowledge Base for Growth Policy in Europe Economic growth has a top priority on the agenda of European economic policy. Since the 2008 economic crisis, Europe\u2019s growth performance has been sluggish and inca- pable of reaching the level of growth in the USA, which has recovered much faster from the economic crisis. The low growth and high unemployment in Europe has negative effects on the lives of European citizens and on European states. It has entailed increased inequality and raised new sustainability issues. However, at the same time, Europe\u2019s growth pattern has experienced important qualitative changes as Europe has become more knowledge based and globalised, and solving the current challenges provides new growth opportunities, as social innovation shows. This publication presents those FP7 SSH research projects, which took up the task of understanding the (lack of) European growth dynamism and Europe\u2019s readiness to enter into a new and sustainable growth path. Understanding the reasons for Europe\u2019s relatively weak productivity per - formance and weak investment in R&D, innovation and other intangibles as well as lack of knowledge-intensive firms provide insights necessary for designing better and more targeted European growth and job creation policies. Research has also taken up the European risk capital markets as a necessary condition for growth as well as the role of social innovation and creativity as a source of job creation and inclusive growth.

        "73 Publications relevant to employment policy Adult and continuing education in Europe: Using public policy to secure a growth in skills Adult and continuing education has the dual function of contributing to employability and economic growth, on the one hand, and responding to broader societal challenges, in particular promoting social cohesion, on the other. Companies and families support important investments that have, to date, ensured important growth in both skills and the ability of the European population to innovate. Thanks to this commitment, Europe today has a wealth of organisations speciali - sing in adult and continuing education. The sector has grown in importance, both as an increasingly significant player in the economy and in view of its capacity to respond to the demand for learning by the knowledge economy. As this book shows, adult and continuing education has a critical role to play in ensuring Europe copes with the phenomenon of education exclusion that, repeated year after year, generation after generation, undermines social cohesion and the growth of employment. Public policies must respond to two strategic challenges: to encourage the propensity to invest in adult and continuing education and to guarantee the reduction of educational exclusion. 2013.

        "The Social Sciences and Humanities comprise a range of scientific disciplines examining the relations between humans in their societal contexts. While the Humanities deal particularly with history, culture and various forms of human behaviour, Social Sciences tend to focus on the social interactions of individual human beings and groups. They address questions such as: How do people live and work together in contemporary societies? Why do individuals organise themselves into communities and want to share the same future? What do Europeans think about globalisation and how do they react to it? Why and how do citizens engage in or abstain from electoral and other forms of political participation? Addressing such far-reaching questions, the Social Sciences and Humanities play a critical role in anticipating and accompanying the evolution of societies, while satisfying humanity\u2019s deep-rooted interest in reflecting on life. Consecutive European Union Framework Programmes for Research have acknowledged the significance of Social Sciences and Humanities research and have supported it at EU level over the past decades. Horizon 2020 recognises Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) as an ensemble of separate disciplines and highlights their particularly high aptitude to fruitfully collaborate with other disciplines in tackling major societal challenges.
