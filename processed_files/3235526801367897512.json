The Cotonou Agreement was concluded in June 2000 for a 20-year period; separate, multiannual protocols definetheaggregateamountofCommunityaidtothe ACPs for each successive financial period. The European Investment Bank supports the European Union\u2019s cooperation and development policies in the African, Caribbean and Pacific regions under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement between the EU and 77 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The EIB manages the ACP Investment Facility, a EUR 2 037m risk-bearing instrument financed from the European Develop- ment Fund and geared specifically to fostering private sector investment in the ACP countries. In managing the Investment Facility, the Bank seeks to support the private sector whilst ensur- ing that projects financed by the Facility have a development impact on the wider community or region. In line with the aims and objectives articulated by the international community in the UN Millennium Development Goals, it supports projects that will deliver sustainable social, economic and environmental benefits whilst ensuring strict accountability for public funds. In addition to the ACP Investment Facility, the Bank is currently authorised to lend up to a further EUR 1 700m to the ACP countries from its own resources. Such own resources lending in the ACPs, usually on a long-term basis, is guaranteed by the EU Member States. Mission of the Investment Facility Reducing poverty through sustainable economic growth ",

        "Annual Report 2007 8 Investment Facility Operational highlights for 2007 2007 was the final full year of the Cotonou I mandate and the associated Financial Protocol, pending ratification and entry into force of Cotonou II. With only just over EUR300mremainingavailablefornewapprovalsundertheIFatthestartof2007,the Bankhadtoselectivelymanagethepipelineofprojects.HencesignedIFcommitments during the year totalled EUR 314.6m, compared with EUR 569.6m in 2006. The relative scarcity of IF resources, allied to new guidelines for extending own resources lending, contributed to an increase in annual own resources lending to EUR 431.8m in 2007, compared to EUR 167.3m in 2006. Cumulative own resources lending under Cotonou stood at EUR 818.3m at the end of 2007 (EUR 386.5m at the end of 2006). As a result, the overall level of ACP lending remained stable in 2007 at EUR 746.4m (compared to EUR 736.9m in 2006). Two innovative lines of credit in favour of the environment, totalling EUR 10m, were signed under the separate financial facility available to the Overseas Countries and Territories. Anumberofprojectsforwhichcommitmentsweremadeduringtheperiod2003\u20132007 are now being actively implemented. As a result, there was a marked increase in IF disbursements (EUR 329.2m during 2007), which were covered by Member State contributions as well as reflows from IF operations for an amount of EUR 73.8m. At the end of 2007 cumulative IF disbursements stood at EUR 725.2m. Own resources disbursements amounted to EUR 110.6m in 2007, over half of the cumulative total of EUR 216.9m for the period 2003-2007. Taking the IF mandate as a whole, total approved and signed operations amount to EUR 1 987m and EUR 1 713m 1 respectively, equivalent to approximately 98% 2 and 84% 3 of the IF\u2019s initial capital endowment. The current IF portfolio comprises 90 projects, of which 30 are regional (either covering the entire ACP or a speci- fied sub-region); country-specific operations under the IF benefit 29 ACPs. EIB own resources operations support 21 projects, of which three are regional, with the remainder targeting 12 ACP countries 4 .

Despite increased uncertainty associated with turbulence in the financial markets of developed economies, the short and medium-term economic outlook for the ACP partner countries is rela- tively benign. ACP countries \u2013 notably in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 have remained mostly insulated from the ongoing financial volatility and are expected to remain so due to their limited integra- tion in the world economy and the modest size of local capital markets. A significant number of ACP countries have also benefited from the overall increase in commodity prices, even if the ben- efits accrue primarily to net oil exporters \u2013 to the cost of net oil importers. Economic conditions could, however, deteriorate if the ongoing financial woes lead to a significant growth slowdown among developed countries, which would then trickle down to developing economies through reduced trade and foreign investment flows. Economic stability could also come under strain in the event of large exchange rate fluctuations. Sub-Saharan Africa Theeconomicnewsoutofsub-SaharanAfricaoverthe last few years has been broadly positive. GDP grew by 5.7% in 2006 and by an estimated 6.1% in 2007.While only marginally above the world average \u2013 and not as spectacular as the pace of growth in certain develop- ing regions \u2013 this performance nonetheless shores up the trend initiated in the last few years. The last four years are the only ones on record since 1980 in which income per capita grew by more than 3%. Growth was particularly strong in oil-producing countries, notably Angola, which at 15.3% in 2006 and an esti- mated 23.6% in 2007, recorded some of the highest growth rates in the world. Several non-oil producing countries also performed well, due to favourable non- oil commodity price developments, a much improved external debt situation and the beneficial impact of a weaker US dollar. The rising trend in oil and other commodity prices in the context of the sustained growth of the world economy has had a positive impact on resource-rich sub-Saharan African countries, notably through an improvement in their terms of trade. The excellent overall performance of oil exporters is, however, mostly due to Angola and Nigeria, the two larg- Jan-05 Jul-05 Jan-06 Jul-06 Jan-07 Jul-07 Jan-08 80 100 120 140 160 180 Chart 1: Commodity prices Non-fuel commodities Raw materials Food Jan-05 Jul-05 Jan-06 Jul-06 Jan-07 Jul-07 Jan-08 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Oil prices (Brent) in USD ",

With the exception of Cameroon, all other oil exporters \u2013 Chad, Republic of Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon \u2013 have had a mixed record in the last couple of years, with very little progress in their income per capita and even a reduction in the case of Chad. This can be partially explained by capacity constraints on oil production in most of these countries. In Chad and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire thepooreconomicperformanceisalsocloselylinked to political strife. Nevertheless, higher commodity priceshavereinforcedtheinvestmentpushofthelast few years.This investment surge is broadly expected to provide a boost to productivity levels and also to contributetosomestrengtheningofGDPgrowthover the medium term.

More broadly, the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI have contributed to a substantial reduction in the region\u2019s debt overhang. This is reflected in the progressive improvement of sovereign ratings and at the same time in the lower level of risk as perceived by investors in the region. Foreign investment inflows have therefore progressed quite rapidly. As shown in Box 1, this partly reflects the increased importance of Asia \u2013 and in particular China \u2013 as a strategic partner for the region. While the last few years have brought economic growth back to the region, progress is limited and the challenges ahead remain enormous. Poverty remains widespread and in fact only a small minority of coun- tries are currently on track to meet the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.Althoughthenumberofopenmili- taryconflictsappearstobewaningandpoliticalstabil- ity is on the rise, the region still occupies the majority Box 1: China\u2019s investment in Africa Since the late 1990s, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI), official assistance and bilateral loans in Africa have increased markedly, the result of a policy aimed at securing access to natu- ral resources, expanding and diversifying exports as well as gaining political and financial lev- erage. Annual Chinese aid flows were estimated at some USD 2-3bn per year in 2004. China has recently pledged to increase its assistance to Africa under a new partnership based on mutual benefits. In November 2006 China announced the doubling of its assistance to Africa, the provi- sion of USD 5bn in preferential loans and increased debt relief. China is by far the largest of non-OECD donors and creditors in Africa, and in some areas is gradu- ally overtaking traditional donors. Aid flows include grants, mostly in kind, as well as technical assistance, training and military assistance. A growing number of official Chinese institutions provide loans to governments in Africa, including Eximbank and China Development Bank. China\u2019s increasing financial involvement in Africa has been accompanied by growing trade. Its annual trade with sub-Saharan Africa surged from USD 9bn to USD 45bn between 2000 and 2006. China has become Africa\u2019s third-largest trading partner, behind the US and France. How- ever, China\u2019s trade with Africa remains concentrated on a limited number of countries, notably oil exporters such as Angola, Nigeria and Sudan. Natural resources account for about 90% of total Chinese imports from Africa, while Chinese exports are concentrated in consumer and investment goods. The stock of Chinese foreign direct investment in Africa is estimated at about USD 6bn, or 10% of worldwide Chinese FDI. Investment flows are currently running at USD 1bn a year, up from only USD 100m a year in 2000. Chinese investment in Africa is decentralised, with hundreds of Chinese enterprises estimated to be present on the continent, active in sectors such as agricul- ture, manufacturing, energy, mining, timber, telecommunications and construction.

        "Annual Report 2007 14 Investment Facility In addition to the difficult institutional environment, the region\u2019s growth outlook remains hampered by several other bottlenecks, notably weak infrastruc- tures (see Box 2). On the other hand, the region should benefit from strong commodity prices and a relatively weak US dollar.The lack of economic diver- sification,however,exposesmanysub-Saharancoun- tries to the vagaries of oil prices and of other external commodities. In addition, as already mentioned, the region is not immune to a negative demand shock caused by a significant growth slowdown in devel- oped economies. Box 2: Energy in Africa Reliable supplies of competitively-priced energy, especially electricity, are necessary to foster eco- nomic development and industrial activity, as well as to improve education facilities and provide decent health care. Increased energy supplies are necessary in order for Africa to achieve the Millen- nium Development Goals. Yet, throughout the continent, the needs of the local population and of companies are not being met. Investment in the African energy sector over the past decade has been below expectations, and not sufficient to keep up with rising demand. According to the World Energy Outlook 2006 report, Africa needs to invest about USD 484bn over the next 25 years for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Private investment in African electricity infrastructure during the period 2001-2004 was below USD 2bn a year. It is esti- mated that power shortages in recent years have reduced African GDP growth rates by 1-2% per annum. An important challenge is to overcome investor perceptions of limited market opportunity and rela- tively high risk for energy investments outside the oil and gas sectors. Another objective is to improve the performance of public utilities, to ensure that the financial and technical capacity exists to prop- erly maintain infrastructure.There is a consensus that public financing will need to play a bigger and more innovative role in African infrastructure, in partnership with the private sector.

In the last few years, growth has stabilised at low levels. Among the main growth drivers are com- modityprices(notablyforPapuaNewGuinea),tourism and aid flows. After severe civil unrest early on in the decade, the Solomon Islands has sustained one of the highest growth rates in the region. Similarly, in 2007 Timor-Leste experienced a large economic expansion following years of political strife. On the other hand, inflationary pressures have increased, due to the higher costs of imported fuel, rapid credit growth and significant inflows of private remittances. Because of their narrow production base, the Pacific islands are all dependent on imported goods, mainly from Aus- tralia and New Zealand.

        "Annual Report 2007 17 Investment Facility Box 3: Economic Partnership Agreements On the economic front, an important feature of the EU-ACP relationship in 2007 was the nego- tiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs).When the original Cotonou Agreement was signed, it was recognised that the trade provisions of the Agreement were not fully compati- ble with World Trade Organization rules, so a waiver was secured until 31 December 2007. The Cotonou Agreement therefore included a commitment to move towardsWTO-compatible EPAs: \u201cEconomic partnership agreements shall be negotiated during the preparatory period which shall end by 31 December 2007 at the latest. Formal negotiations of the new trading arrange- ments shall start in September 2002 and the new trading arrangements shall enter into force by 1 January 2008, unless earlier dates are agreed between the Parties\u201d (Article 37(1) of the Cotonou Agreement. Although negotiators from the European Commission and six ACP sub-regions continued to make good progress in 2007, the challenging objective of signing full EPAs with all ACP regions by the end of the year proved to be beyond reach. For some ACP sub-regions, partial agree- ments have been signed, and negotiations will continue in 2008. The EU believes that high tar- iffs in certain ACP countries protect uncompetitive industries, maintain high prices for local consumers and may encourage smuggling, whereas the increased trade provided by the EPAs (including greater inter-regional trade flows) will compensate the ACPs for reduced tariff rev- enues. However, some ACP countries argue that the EPAs will expose them to strong competi- tion and are seeking additional safeguards and development aid prior to signing an agreement. Ultimately, EPAs should cover all the main trade issues between the EU and the ACP countries \u2013 not only goods but also areas such as services and intellectual property.

Accordingly, a EUR 4.0m credit line was granted to PRO-PME over 10 years, with drawdown available in local currency. To boost its financing capacity and help it diversify into leas- ing activities, technical assistance is also being pro- vided by the Bank. Leasing is particularly attractive to smaller companies, providing them with access to machinery and equipment when they cannot purchase them outright due to lack of funds and/ or loan collateral. The enhanced competitiveness of local firms should generate new jobs and additional income, thus helping to fight poverty. \u2022 Inrecentyears,Ugandahassignificantlyimprovedthe supervisoryandregulatoryframeworksforthefinan- cial sector.

        "Annual Report 2007 21 Investment Facility Box 4: EIB Support for the financial sector in ACP countries Since the entry into force of the Cotonou Agreement in April 2003, the Bank has signed 75 agreements with ACP financial sector counterparts for a total of EUR 1 110m, representing 30% of the combined ACP portfolio of IF and EIB own resources operations. Of this total, EUR 565m (51%) was for credit lines to financial institutions, of which 32 lines were provided under the Investment Facility and four from own resources. During 2007, a total of seven new credit line agreements were signed under the IF with financial institutions in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific: Africa: 5 new credit lines totalling EUR 48.0m Caribbean: 1 new credit line for EUR 10.0m Pacific: 1 new credit line for EUR 2.0m. In addition, a further two credit lines, totalling EUR 10.0m, were signed in the Pacific region under the separate OCT Facility. Given the nature of credit lines, it is normal for their absorption by local banks to be a gradual process. During 2007, allocations under IF credit lines rose to EUR 127.8m, involving 324 indi- vidual allocations and representing 38% of signatures (up from 27% at the end of 2006). EIB support extends beyond strictly project-related activities. In November 2007, a team from the EIB\u2019s Office of the Chief Compliance Officer (OCCO) travelled to Douala, Cameroon in order to present a two-day training seminar on Combating Money Laundering to local financial insti- tutions. The presentation, which addressed concerns relating to the operating environment in Central Africa and included interactive sessions, was well received by participants. In addition, the EIB is playing a leading role in the development of local currency bond issues.

Depending on the outcome of this exercise, a number of pro- posed Bank operations in this sub-region could become eligible for local currency funding. Conscious of the vital importance of the financial sector in promoting wider development in the ACP region, the Bank is developing a new, more focused strategy for the sector which will be implemented in parallel with the entry into force of Cotonou II during 2008. In broad terms, the new strategy will: be based upon an enhanced strategic analysis and diagnosis of financial sectors at country and regional levels; encourage innovation, including the promotion of access to finance for the poor (\u201cfinance for all\u201d); continue to prioritise finance for growth, the development of SMEs and of local financial sectors and markets; provide for an increase in technical assistance to ACP financial institutions.

Companies in both the private and commercially run public sec- tors will benefit.

        "Annual Report 2007 23 Investment Facility Box 5: Development impact The Economic and Social Impact Assessment Framework (ESIAF) is a framework for assessing, at the appraisal stage, some of the key features of projects financed by the Bank outside the Euro- pean Union, in particular in the ACP region, for which it was initially developed. It enables the Bank to better highlight a broader range of impacts, notably in the social area, when assessing the quality and soundness of a project. ESIAF follows a three-pillar design, similar to the value- added one adopted and implemented for EIB operations within the EU, and seeks to measure the following: After an initial pilot phase, ESIAF has been applied systematically to all IF and own resources direct operations (investment loans) appraised during 2007. The outcome for 2007 is reflected in the table below: Six projects out of the sixteen 10 rated during the year received a \u201chigh\u201d rating on all three pil- lars, including the Bujagali Hydroelectric Project in Uganda and the Ambatovy Nickel Project in Madagascar (see Boxes 6 and 8), both landmark projects for the countries concerned. Only one industrial project \u2013 relating to the production of metal sheet roofing \u2013 was rated\u201cmedium\u201don all three pillars. Overall the implementation of ESIAF provides a more systematic analysis of the developmental, environmental and social aspects of projects. During 2007, the Framework was further refined and adapted to indirect operations channelled through financial intermediaries, such as lines of credit and investment funds. As from 2008, ESIAF will thus also be implemented systematically for such indirect operations, thereby cover- ing the whole portfolio. A major benefit of the Framework is that it will allow a comparison of expected and actual outcomes during the monitoring and ex post evaluation stages. Moreover, in due course, independent ex post evaluations will assist in the evaluation of the appraisal and monitoring carried out by project teams. 10 Includingtwoprojectsap- provedundertheseparate mandatefortheRepublic ofSouthAfrica.

AEUR5.0mcreditlinewassignedwith BanqueCal\u00e9do- nienne d\u2019Investissement (BCI), based in New Caledo- nia.These long-term funds will support BCI lending to localprojectsinthefieldsofrenewableenergyandthe environment. To be eligible, projects must fall under one of the following categories: renewable energy, investmentsaimedatimprovingenergymanagement andefficiency,sewagetreatment,wastemanagement and/or pollution reduction. A similar credit line in favour of the environment, also for EUR 5.0m, was signed with Banque SOCREDO , based in French Polynesia. For both operations, an EIB environmental specialist based in the EIB Pacific Regional Office will monitor the eligibility of the proposed projects, to ensure that the objectives as regards renewable energy and the protection of the environment are achieved. In addition, a EUR 10.0m facility targeted at SME finance in the Caribbean (in the first instance, OBNA Bank and AIB Bank) was approved during 2007; the firstcontractsareduetobesignedearlyin2008.When these operations are finalised, all of the Investment Facility funding available for the OCTs under the first Cotonou Agreement will have been committed.

        "Annual Report 2007 29 Investment Facility Box 7: Increasing use of technical assistance (TA) Grant funding for TA will enable the Bank to become more proactive in its approach to invest- ment projects in the ACP region. TA can be applied to all phases of the project cycle and will assist the EIB in better identifying and preparing projects, including the assessment of devel- opment impact aspect. Within the current Cotonou I framework, it is estimated that the vast majority of funds available forTA procurement (EUR 18.7m) will be allocated, with a focus on support for the ACP financial sector. The provision of TA is likely to increase steadily under Cotonou II as a larger envelope \u2013 up to EUR 40m 11 \u2013 will be available for this purpose. To date, the following TA contracts have been signed under the IF: \u2022 Cameroon - Assistance Technique au Pr\u00eat Global Pro-PME II (EUR 0.14m) \u2022 Malawi \u2013 Advisory Services for Peri-Urban Water and Sanitation (EUR 0.25m) \u2022 East Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy): - Study/update of cable traffic demand (EUR 0.04m) - Legal Advisor for Special Purpose Vehicle (EUR 0.65m) - Special Purpose Vehicle Management Team (EUR 0.57m) In addition, funding for a number of technical assistance facilities was approved in 2007 \u2013 for example, in support of the Pacific Islands Finance Facility II (see above) and to undertake two major feasibility studies on behalf of the West African Power Pool (see below). Looking ahead, a number of new TA projects are expected to materialise during 2008, including support for a number of microfinance institutions which already benefit from IF loans or equity invest- ments. Technical assistance \u2013 WAPP regional interconnection projects With the aim of promoting economic growth through regional infrastructure development, two technical assistance agreements were signed in 2007 to finance pre-investment studies under the auspices of the West African Power Pool (WAPP). The first proposed interconnection, between Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali (TA of up to EUR 2m) will facilitate the supply of cheaper and more reliable energy to landlocked Sahel countries.The second interconnection \u2013 between C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea (TA of up to EUR 3m) \u2013 will be a key component of reconstruction efforts in the post-conflict areas of the region.

        "Annual Report 2007 32 Investment Facility Box 8: The Ambatovy Nickel Project in Madagascar The Ambatovy project concerns the development of a new open-pit lateritic nickel mine near Moramanga, approximately 80 km east of the capital Antananarivo. This will also involve the construction and operation of a hydrometallurgical refinery near Madagascar\u2019s main port Toa- masina, a 220 km slurry pipeline connecting mine and refinery, a tailings disposal plant close to the refinery and related infrastructure. The project is expected to produce some 60 000 t of LME grade 1 nickel and 5 600 t of cobalt metal per year.With an estimated cost of USD 3.7bn, the Ambatovy project is one of the largest nickel mining and processing developments currently being prepared and its favourable geological characteristics should place it among the lowest- cost producers worldwide. The Ambatovy project is fully in line with the core objectives of the Cotonou Agreement and the Bank\u2019s strategy in the ACPs, as it contributes significantly to sustainable social and eco- nomic development and poverty alleviation through the financing of productive investments promoted by the private sector.The majority of the investment costs (approximately 80%) con- cern the refining component, which will generate high value added in Madagascar. It is in line with the Bank\u2019s Extractive Industries Review and will noticeably contribute towards achieving strategic elements of Madagascar\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Furthermore, the project will directly contribute to opening up the country to regional and global economic integration. In total the project includes over USD 300m (EUR 221m) worth of programmes that will con- tribute to long-term economic development through (i) health, safety and other social pro- grammes; (ii) infrastructure improvement in road, rail, port upgrade/expansion, water/waste treatment, communication infrastructure; and (iii) industrial infrastructure to benefit other projects and industries. The project\u2019s\u201cLocal Resource Development Initiative\u201dwill develop the skills of individual workers and indirectly \u2013 and significantly \u2013 promote the business of local suppliers, contractors and service industries.The important environmental and social (including gender) issues have been properly addressed by the promoter and mitigating measures have been incorporated into the project design or are envisaged. Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot with a number of endangered species. The project spon- sors are acutely aware of this issue and have put in place measures to manage biodiversity con- servation, enhance the sustainable management of existing natural resources and contribute to improved environmental protection. A very detailed independent Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), complying with EU Directive 97/11, was prepared for the project and approved in early 2007 by the Office National de l\u2019Environnement, the competent local author- ity. NGOs present in Madagascar have commented favourably on the contribution which the Ambatovy project can make to help preserving Madagascar\u2019s endangered environment, which would otherwise continue to suffer critical damage from traditional poverty-driven (slash and burn) farming techniques.

Backedbystrongcommodityprices,theminingindus- try has been booming over the last few years and, with private sector support, many African countries have been able to exploit the potential of their huge resources.

More generally, a balance needs to be struck between devoting resources to identifying and implementing new projects in the ACP countries and monitoring the exist- ing loan portfolio, which involves some 600 active projects, including commitments under the Lom\u00e9 Convention. Following an internal evaluation in 2007, the ACP-IF Department undertook a major review of project monitoring, with a view to strengthening the procedures and sys- tems in place and thereby ensuring a more consistent approach across the portfolio.The goal is to provide timely and relevant information, both at the level of individual projects and for the portfolio as a whole. An important element of this increasingly proactive approach to monitoring will be the applica- tion during 2008 of the Bank\u2019s loan-grading system to the Cotonou portfolio. This will result in a classification of all ACP operations linked to a common review cycle and provide an overview of the state of portfolio. which provide a good basis to achieve greater country coverage).

The IF is seeking to promote local currency opera- tions, but must at the same time carefully monitor the medium-to-long term foreign exchange risks borne by the Facility. Options to mitigate such risks include fund-raising in local markets (bond issues) or hedging arrangements with banks and specialised currency vehicles. Equity investments carry higher risks than loans, but have the potential to provide significantly higher returns. At the end of 2007, the IF equity portfolio represented approximately 14% of signed commit- ments. The majority of equity investments are par- ticipations in investment funds and venture capital funds, some of which are already fully invested and have started to divest, with promising initial returns.

        "Annual Report 2007 43 Investment Facility Partnerships The Bank collaborates closely with the European Commission and Member States through regu- lar meetings on policy matters as well as country, sector or project-specific issues. The Bank is consulted when the Commission prepares country and regional strategies and the extent of its involvement is normally covered in the relevant country or regional strategy paper. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure coherence and synergies between EU development aid and the Bank\u2019s operations. Overall responsibility for setting the policy of the IF rests with the Bank\u2019s Manage- ment Committee and Board of Directors, in close consultation with the IF Committee. On the basis of proposals from the Bank, the IF Committee provides guidance on IF investments, policies and strategies. Bringing together representatives of all EU Member States as well as the Commis- sion, the IF Committee helps to ensure greater coherence and efficiency of EU development aid. At a more operational level, the Bank works closely with a number of European development finance institutions (EDFIs) through the European Financing Partners grouping (see Box 13) and also collaborates actively in a number of areas, notably on infrastruc- ture projects, with Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppe- ment (AFD) and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcrWiederaufbau (KfW). The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund, managed by the EIB, is fostering closer collaboration between EU donors and project financiers in pursuit of a common goal \u2013 enhanced financing for regional infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa. The Trust Fund made a strong start in 2007, with four grants approved for regional infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa and with clearanceinprincipleagreedforafurthertwoprojects. The Trust Fund Project Financiers Group (PFG) meets regularly,andishelpingtofurtherstrengthenthegood working relationships that exist between European development financiers at field level. Coordination between the EIB and major multilateral development banks and international finance insti- tutions is systematically pursued in order to maxim- ise the development impact and avoid duplication of effort, and thus reduce the administrative burden on the governments of recipient countries. Hence the EIB supportstheaimsofthe2005ParisDeclarationonAid Effectiveness and is also an active participant in the trilateral relationship that has been established with the European Commission and the African Develop- ment Bank; a series of working meetings between the three institutions in September 2007 led to the estab- lishment of a common action plan. The Bank is also a regular participant in the \u201cLimelette\u201d dialogue proc- essbetweentheEuropeanCommissionandtheWorld Bank, which seeks to promote coordination on the groundinAfricaand,morerecently,joinedtheG8-sup- ported\u201cMaking Finance Work for Africa\u201dpartnership. During2007,theEIBsignedaMemorandumofUnder- standingwiththeAsianDevelopmentBank,toextend cooperationintheAsianandPacificregions.TheMoU defines a number of priority areas for cooperation, including renewable energy and energy efficiency projectsdesignedtocontributetoclimateprotection and lead to significant reductions in CO 2 emissions. The EIB is also a member of the Infrastructure Consor- tium for Africa (ICA), which includes leading multilat- eral organisations such as the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank, as well as a number of leading bilateral donors active in Africa. In February 2008, the EIB hosted a working-level meeting of the ICA in Luxembourg, dedicated to regional infrastruc- ture projects in Africa. ",
        "Annual Report 2007 44 Investment Facility Box 12: European financing partners EFP is a special purpose vehicle created in 2004 and jointly owned by the European development finance institutions (EDFIs) and the EIB, under which mainly medium-sized, commercially viable pri- vate sector projects in ACP countries are financed. Under the EFP structure, the EIB participates in the financing of projects that are promoted, appraised and monitored by the EDFIs. Out of EFP\u2019s existing EUR 330m total funding capacity, EUR 190m has been provided by the IF. At the end of 2007, EFP had committed EUR 150m in favour of 14 projects in ten countries in Africa and the Caribbean. Among the projects supported by the IF through EFP are: Nigeria Zenith Bank , one of the leading commercial banks in Nigeria, a so-called new generation bank, which has been very successful in competing with existing banks by following an active growth strat- egy and providing a diversified range of new banking products and services. Its strategic goal is to become a recognised international financial institution, building upon its base in Nigeria. Digicel International Finance Ltd. is the financial holding of the Digicel Ltd. (Digicel) group of compa- nies, the number one cellular phone operator in the English-speaking Caribbean countries, with opera- tions in more than 20 markets. EFP is participating in the financing of the rollout and development of the company\u2019s GSM networks across the Caribbean region. Nigeria GuarantyTrust Bank Plc (GTB) was incorporated in 1990 as a private limited liability company and commenced operation in 1991. In 1996 the bank listed 74% of its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and in 2001 it obtained its universal banking licence. GTB\u2019s strategy is to provide specialised financial services to the middle and top end of the market. Zambia Copperbelt Energy Corporation (CEC) is a profitable, independent electricity transmission and distribution company.The company supplies power to Zambia\u2019s copper and cobalt mining/processing companies in the Copperbelt, accounting for 60% of Zambia\u2019s power sales. CEC was created in 1997 and is owned by Zambia Energy Corporation (ZamEn). In turn, ZamEn is a joint venture between certain Directors of CEC, the power project developer Aldwych International, the Development Bank of South- ern Africa (DBSA) and FMO of the Netherlands. Kenya Panda Flowers Ltd. produces and exports cut flowers and also provides services to independ- ent local companies engaged in cut flower production. The company is located at the Flower Business Park in Naivasha, which benefits from well-developed infrastructure (roads, water supply, electricity, etc.) and almost 150 ha of greenhouses. ",

The Regional Offices have reinforced the Bank\u2019s visibility within the vari- ous African business communities, and also make a significant contribution to the work of the Luxem- bourg-based ACP-IF operational divisions, not least throughtheprovisionofalocalperspectiveonprojects and other developments. Similar, positive results are expected in the Caribbean and Pacific regions follow- ing the recent establishment of representative offices for the Caribbean (Fort-de-France, opened in May 2007) and the Pacific (Sydney, November 2007). As a result of these new offices, the EIB now has a physical presence in all ACP regions. At the end of 2007, 11 EIB staff were assigned to the five ACP Regional Representations, to which can be added technical support for the three African offices provided by locally hired contract staff. Regional Office activity 2007 was a busy year for the West Africa Regional Representative Office in Dakar, with a number of new developments both locally in Senegal and also in the wider West Africa region. In the crucial water sector for example, the Office took the lead in the appraisal of new projects in Benin and Senegal for submission to the EU-Water Facility and in the prep- aration of future operations in Burkina Faso (ONEA II) and Senegal (Assainissement de la Baie de Hann). The Head of the Office represented the Bank at a large number of key gatherings and conferences, including the EU-Africa Business Forum held in Accra during June. In 2007 the East and Central Africa Regional Repre- sentative Office, based in Nairobi, contributed to the identification and appraisal of two possible opera- tions: the Kenya Airports Authority\u2019s expansion and upgrading of JKIA airport in Nairobi (EUR 35m) and a bond guarantee for Uganda Microfinance Ltd (up to USD 4m). It also actively followed up the Lom\u00e9- financedDar-es-SalaamwatersupplyprojectinTanza- nia with DAWASA, which had encountered difficulties. The Nairobi Office represented the EIB for a number of loan signings, including the Rwanda Global Loan II Private Sector Support, the Lines of Credit for Banque Rwandaise du D\u00e9veloppement and Banque Commer- ciale du Rwanda, and the Finance Contract with Fina Bank, one of the intermediaries of the new EUR 20m Kenya Private Sector Finance Facility. The Office was also present at a number of key investment and infra- structure conferences and seminars throughout East and Central Africa. During the past year, the EIB Regional Representative Officein SouthernAfricaandtheIndianOcean ,(based inTshwane/Pretoria)significantlystrengthenedinstitu- tional and operational partnerships, notably with the European Commission and EU Member State agen- cies. The Office contributed to a number of events, including a strategy and programming meeting for EC Delegations in the SADC region and conferences targeting the financial and private sectors. Good col- laboration with the Commission in Malawi helped to advance the largest project chosen for co-financing under the second round of the Water Facility (due for signature in 2008). In Mozambique, Swaziland, Mau- ritius and Zambia, synergies with the Commission\u2019s Sugar Facility were explored. The Office, together with other MFIs, also participated in high-level meet- ingswiththeMadagascarandMauritiusGovernments regarding finance for future infrastructure priorities.

        "Annual Report 2007 51 Investment Facility As was the case for the whole of the 9th EDF, year- end profit and accumulated earnings do not take into account the costs incurred by the Bank for managing the IF, which include the direct costs incurred by the respective operational directorates and, on a pro rata basis, the costs of non-operational directorates and otheroverheads. ThesecostsarefullycoveredbyMem- ber States and by appraisal or other fees charged by theIFforspecificprojects. Suchcostsandrevenuesfor 2007 are summarised in the table below: The IF operates in a number of countries whose econ- omies are largely US dollar-related and hence has a significant portion of US dollar-denominated invest- ments, accounting for 48% of total outstanding loans andequityinvestmentsattheendof2007. Thecurrent policy of minimising the IF currency risk exposure on non-euro-denominated lending by entering into cur- rency swaps cannot be applied equally to the whole portfolio.

        "Annual Report 2007 64 Investment Facility 1. General information The Investment Facility has been established within the frame- work of the Cotonou Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) on co- operation and development assistance negotiated between the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (the\u201cACP States\u201d) and the European Union and its Member States on 23 June 2000 and revised on 25 June 2005. The Investment Facility is managed by the European Invest- ment Bank (the\u201cEIB\u201dor the\u201cBank\u201d). Under the terms of the Agreement up to EUR 2,200 million for ACP and EUR 20 mil- lion for OCT (as agreed by the Council Decision of 27 Novem- ber 2001 on the association of the Overseas Countries and Territories with the European Community) may be allocated to finance the Investment Facility. Within the framework of the Agreement, the EIB also manages loans granted from its own resources. All other financial resources and instruments under the Agreement are administered by the European Commission. 2. Significant accounting policies 2.1. Basis of preparation In line with the Investment Facility Management Agreement the preparation of the financial statements of the Facility is guided by International Public Sector Accounting Standards or International Financial Reporting Standards, as appropri- ate. The Facility\u2019s financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the following significant accounting princi- ples: 2.2. Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires manage- ment to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Investment Facility\u2019s accounting policies.The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed. The most significant use of judgments and estimates are as follows: Fair value of financial instruments Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabili- ties recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valu- ation techniques that include the use of mathematical mod- els. The input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a de- gree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as correlation and volatility for longer dated de- rivatives. Impairment losses on loans and receivables The Investment Facility reviews its problem loans and receiva- bles at each reporting date to assess whether an allowance for impairment should be recorded in the income statement. In particular, judgment by management is required in the estima- tion of the amount and timing of future cash flows when de- termining the level of allowance required. Such estimates are based on assumptions about a number of factors and actual results may differ, resulting in future changes to the allowance. In addition to specific allowance against individually significant loans and receivables, the Investment Facility also makes a col- lective impairment allowance against exposures which, al- though not specifically identified as requiring a specific allowance, have a greater risk of default than when originally granted. This collective allowance is based on any deteriora- tion in the internal rating of the loan or investment since it was granted or acquired. These internal ratings take into consid- eration factors such as any deterioration in country risk, indus- try, and technological obsolescence, as well as identified structural weaknesses or deterioration in cash flows. Valuation of unquoted available-for-sale equity investments Valuation of unquoted available-for-sale equity investments is normally based on one of the following: recent arms length market transactions; \u2022 current fair value of another instrument that is sub- \u2022 stantially the same; the expected cash flows discounted at current rates \u2022 applicable for items with similar terms and risk char- acteristics; or other valuation models. \u2022 The determination of the cash flows and discount factors for unquoted available-for-sale equity investments requires sig- nificant estimation. The Investment Facility calibrates the valuation techniques periodically and tests them for validity using either price from observable current market transac- tions in the same instrument or from other available observ- able market data. Impairment of available-for-sale financial investments The Investment Facility treats available-for-sale equity invest- ments as impaired when there has been a significant or pro- longed decline in the fair value below its cost or where other objective evidence of impairment exists.The determination of whether a decline is significant or prolonged is based on a judgmental appreciation. Notes to the financial statements ",
        "Annual Report 2007 65 Investment Facility 2.3. Change in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those used in the previous financial years. 2.4. Summary of significant accounting policies The balance sheet represents assets and liabilities in decreas- ing order of liquidity and does not distinguish between cur- rent and non-current items. 2.4.1. Foreign currency translation The Investment Facility uses the Euro (EUR) for presenting its financial statements, which is also the functional and pres- entational currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated, in accordance with IAS 21, at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than in Euro are translated into Euro at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The gain or loss arising from such translation is recorded in the income state- ment. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are trans- lated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of transac- tions at rates different from those at the date of the transac- tion, and unrealized foreign exchange differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognized in the income statement. The elements of the income statement are translated into Euro on the basis of the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each month. 2.4.2. Cash and cash equivalents The Investment Facility defines cash equivalents as current accounts or short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 2.4.3. Financial assets other than derivatives Financial assets are accounted for using the settlement date basis. Loans Loans originated by the Investment Facility are recognized in the assets of the Investment Facility when cash is advanced to borrowers. They are initially recorded at cost (net dis- bursed amounts), which is the fair value of the cash given to originate the loan, including any transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effec- tive yield method, less any provision for impairment or uncol- lectability. Available-for-sale financial investments Available-for-sale financial investments are those which are designated as such or do not qualify to be classified as des- ignated at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity or loans and receivables. They include equity instruments, investments in venture capital funds and other debt instru- ments. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial investments are subsequently carried at fair value. Note the following details for the fair value measurement of equity investments, which can not be derived from active mar- kets: a. Venture capital funds The fair value of each venture capital fund will be based on the Net AssetValue (NAV), reported by the fund, if calculated based on international valuation standards.The Investment F a c i l i t y m a y h o w e v e r d e c i d e t o a d j u s t the NAV reported by the fund if there are issues that may affect the valuation. If no internationally recognized fair valuation standard is ap- plied, the valuation will be conducted on the basis of the underlying portfolio. b. Direct equity investments The fair value of the investment will be based on the latest set of financial statements available, re-using, if applicable, the same model as the one used at the acquisi- tion of the participation. Unrealized gains or losses on equity investments are report- ed in equity until such investments are sold, collected or disposed of, or until such investment are determined to be impaired. If an available-for-sale investment is determined to be impaired, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss previ- ously recognized in equity is included in the income state- ment. For unquoted investment, the fair value is determined by applying recognized valuation technique.These investments are accounted for at cost when the fair value cannot be reli- ably measured. Guarantees Financial guarantees are initially recognized at fair value in the balance sheet under item\u201cFinancial guarantees\u201d. Subse- quent to initial recognition, the Investment Facility\u2019s liabilities under each guarantee are measured at the higher of the am- ortized premium and the best estimate of expenditure re- quired to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee. Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken to the income statement under item\u201cImpairment charge for credit loss\u201d. The premium received is recognized in the income statement under item\u201cNet fee and commis- sion income\u201dusing the effective interest rate method over the life of the guarantee. ",
        "Annual Report 2007 66 Investment Facility 2.4.4. Impairment of financial assets The Investment Facility assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evi- dence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an in- curred\u201closs event\u201d) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evi- dence of impairment may include indications that the bor- rower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or prin- cipal payments, the probability that they will enter bank- ruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. For the loans outstanding at the end of the financial year and carried at amortized cost, impairments are made when pre- senting objective evidence of risks of non recovery of all or part of their amounts according to the original contractual terms or the equivalent value. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recog- nized in the income statement. Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the effective interest rate of the asset. Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or de- creases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. The Investment Facility conducts credit risk assessments based on which there is no need for a collective impairment provision. For the available-for-sale financial investments, the Invest- ment Facility assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that an investment is impaired. Objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its costs. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss (measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognized in the income statement) is removed from equity and recognized in the income state- ment. Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial in- vestments are not reversed through the income statement; increases in their fair value after impairment are recognized directly in equity. For held-to-maturity investments the Investment Facility as- sesses individually whether there is objective evidence for impairment. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset\u2019s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.The car- rying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. If, in a subse- quent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss decreases because of an event occurring after the impair- ment was recognised, any amount formerly charged are credited to the\u201cNet result on financial operations\u201d. The European Investment Bank\u2019s Risk Management reviews financial assets for impairment at least once a year. Resulting adjustments include the unwinding of the discount in the income statement over the life of the asset, and any adjust- ments required in respect of a reassessment of the initial impairment. 2.4.5. Derivative financial instruments Derivatives include cross currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps. In the normal course of its activity, the Investment Facility may enter into swap contracts with a view to hedge specific lend- ing operations, denominated in actively traded currencies other than the Euro, in order to offset any gain or loss caused by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the Investment Facility has not entered into any hedge accounting transactions as at 31 December 2007. Therefore, all derivatives are measured at fair value through the income statement. Fair values are derived primarily from discounted cash-flow models, option-pricing models and from third party quotes. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are included in\u201cNet result on financial operations\u201d. 2.4.6. Contributions Contributions from Member States are recognized as receiv- able in the balance sheet on the date of the Council Decision fixing the financial contribution to be paid by the Member States to the Investment Facility. 2.4.7. Interest income on loans Interest on loans originated by the Investment Facility is re- corded in the profit and loss account (\u201cInterest and similar in- come\u201d) and on the balance sheet (\u201cLoan and receivables\u201d) on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the loan to the net carry- ing amount of the loan. Once the recorded value of a loan has been reduced due to impairment, interest income continues to be recognized using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount. 2.4.8. Interest subsidies As part of its activity, the Investment Facility manages inter- est subsidies on behalf of the Member States. The part of the Member States contributions allocated to the payment of interest subsidies is not accounted for in the In- vestment Facility\u2019s equity but is classified as an amount owed ",

Interest income on treasury Under the terms of the Investment Facility and according to the Financial Regulation applicable to the 9th European De- velopment Fund, the funds received by the EIB on behalf of the Investment Facility are recorded in an account in the Commission\u2019s name.

Commitment fees are deferred and recognized in in- come using the effective interest method over the period from disbursement to repayment of the related loan. Dividends relating to available-for-sale equity investments are recognized when received. 2.4.11. Taxation The Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the Euro- pean Communities, appended to the Treaty of 8 April 1965 establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities, stipulates that the assets, revenues and other property of the Institutions of the Union are ex- empt from all direct taxes. 2.4.12.

Management Committee\u2019s responsibility for the finan- cial statements The Management Committee of the European Investment Bank is responsible for the preparation and fair presenta- tion of these financial statements in accordance with the measurement and recognition principles as described in Note 2 of the accompanying financial statements.This re- sponsibility includes: designing, implementing and main- taining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from ma- terial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; select- ing and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Responsibility of the\u201cR\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises\u201d Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these finan- cial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Audit- ing as adopted by the Luxembourg\u201cInstitut des R\u00e9viseurs d\u2019Entreprises\u201d. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the judg- ment of the\u201cR\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises\u201d, including the assess- ment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the\u201cR\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises\u201dconsiders in- ternal control relevant to the entity\u2019s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of ac- counting estimates made by the Management Commit- tee, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Investment Facility as of December 31, 2007, of its financial performance, of its changes in equity and of its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the measurement and recogni- tion principles as described in Note 2 of the accompanying financial statements.
