        "1 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index The Gender Equality Index 2017 examines the progress and challenges in achieving gender equality across the European Union from 2005 to 2015. Using a scale from 1 (full inequality) to 100 (full equality), it measures the differences between women and men in key domains of the EU policy framework (work, money, knowledge, time, power and health). The Index also measures violence against women and intersecting inequalities. These are satellite domains and are part of the framework of the Gender Equality Index, but do not have an impact on the overall score. Intersecting inequalities show how gender intersects with age, education, family composition, country of birth and disability. The Gender Equality Index provides results for each domain and sub-domain for the EU and its 28 Member States (1). (1) The Gender Equality Index 2017 is based on the data of Eurostat (Education statistics, EU Labour Force Survey, European Health Interview Survey, EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, Structure of Earnings Survey), of Eurofound (European Quality of Life Survey, European Working Conditions Survey), of EIGE\u2019s Gender Statistics Database (Women and Men in Decision-Making) and of the Fundamental Rights Agency\u2019s Violence Against Women survey. The year of reference is 2015 (2014 for data on intersecting inequalities). The age of the reference population for the indicators is either 15+, 16+ or 18+, depending on the source. Gender Equality Index 2017: Cyprus Change in score from 2005 to 2015 CY EU-28 66.2 CY 55.1 9.2 4.2 Progress in gender equality in Cyprus, 2005-2015 In the Gender Equality Index 2017, Cyprus achieved a score of 55.1 out of 100 , which is an increase of 9.2 points since 2005. This trend shows faster progress than the EU-28 average. Cyprus\u2019s Index rank has increased by six positions, to reach 22nd place. All the domain scores have progressed, and most of them have done so at a faster pace than in the other EU Member States. The gender equality scores in the domains of health and money are rather high and on the rise. Cyprus shows a good gender balance in access to services and overall health status. Both the economic and financial situations of women and men are in line with EU scores. The biggest improvements have taken place in the domains of knowledge and power , though they remain below the EU aver- age. Gender equality in decision-making positions in Cyprus has room for improvement in all areas, especially in the political arena. Progress is slower in the domain of work due to continued gender segregation. The greatest challenge is in the domain of time . The division of time dedicated to social activities is much less gender equal than in the EU-28. ",
        "2 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Work In the domain of work, greater participation and lower gender segregation in employment contributed to an increase in the score. The employment rate (20-64) is 64 % for women versus 72 % for men. The total employment rate is 68 % and Cyprus has not yet reached the national target of the Europe 2020 strategy (EU2020) (75-77 %). The full-time equivalent (FTE) employment rate of women is about 45 %, com- pared to 53 % for men. The gender gap in the FTE employment rate increases with age; the gap is 6 6 percentage points (p.p.) to the detriment of women aged 25-49 and 19 p.p. to the detriment of women aged 50-64. The FTE gender gap is much greater among single women and men (35 % versus 58 %, respectively), in couples with children (64 % versus 80 %, respectively) and among people with disabili- ties (18 % versus 30 %, respectively), always to the detriment of women. 17 % of women work part-time, compared to 11 % of men. On average, women work 37 hours per week, compared to 41 hours for men. 5 % of working-age women versus 0.1 % of working-age men are economically inactive or work part-time due to care responsibilities. Gender segregation in the labour market is a reality for both women and men, even if it occurs to a lesser extent compared to other Member States. Nearly 20 % of women compared to 7 % of men work in education, human health and social work activities (EHW). The share of women and men working in EHW is much higher among those who have completed tertiary education. The gender gap is wider between women and men with a higher level of education. Gender segregation is much higher among the native-born population compared to foreign-born people. Eight times more men (25 %) than women (3 %) work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) occupations. Money The situation in the domain of money has improved. Gender equality has improved in earnings and income, but has remained almost unchanged in poverty and in the distribution of wealth. Mean monthly earnings of women and men have increased. Women earn nearly 18 % less than men per month. The gender gap is the same for women in a couple, both with and without children. Lone mothers, however, earn more compared to lone fathers. The gender gap in monthly earnings grows with age; it is also greatest among women and men with a higher level of education and among those who were born outside of the EU-28. While the population of women at risk of poverty (17 %, down from 19 %) has slightly decreased, the population of men at risk of poverty (15 %) has remained the same. The risk of poverty increased to nearly 30 % among single women, lone mothers and women aged 65+. 43 % and 36 % of non-EU-born women and men, respectively, are at risk of poverty in Cyprus. Inequalities in income distribution have slightly increased. The gender pay gap is 14 % to the detriment of women. In 2012, the gender gap in pensions was 37 % to the detriment of women. Both values are slightly higher than the EU-28 average (16 % and 38 %, respectively).

        "3 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Knowledge All the scores in the domain of knowledge have improved. The situation has become more gender equal overall and segregation in study fields has decreased significantly. The number of tertiary graduates has greatly increased. Women have sur- passed men in tertiary education (35 % and 30 %, respectively). Cyprus has met its national EU2020 target to have 46 % of people aged 30-34 obtain a tertiary degree; as it stands, 55 % of people in that age group have obtained tertiary education. The rate of participation of women and men in lifelong learning has pro- gressed too, but at a slower pace. Gender segregation in study fields remains a major challenge. The gen- der gap in tertiary education in the fields of education, health and welfare, humanities and arts has slightly decreased, but remains high. 40 % of women students, compared to only 17 % of men students, are concentrated in these fields, which are traditionally seen as \u2018feminine\u2019. Time In the domain of time, the score increased. The greatest challenge remains in the division of time allocated to social activities between women and men. Women are more likely to spend spend time caring for their family (50 % ver- sus 34 % of men). However, the gender gap is narrower. Among couples with children, 92 % of women have daily care responsibilities compared to 70 % of men. 78 % of non-EU-born women have daily care responsibilities for an hour or more, as opposed to only 44 % of men in the same group. 81 % of women compared to only 27 % of men do the cooking and house- work every day for at least 1 hour. The gender gap is bigger among people with disabilities (88 % and 18 %, respectively) and non-EU-born women and men (96 % and 13 %, respectively). In all couples, both with and without chil- dren, the gender gap is nearly 60 p.p. to the detriment of women. Inequality in time-sharing at home also extends to social activities. Men are twice as likely as women to participate in sporting, cultural and leisure activ- ities outside the home. This gap widens dramatically in couples with chil- dren, where six times more men compared to women are engaged in such activities. Participation in voluntary or charitable activities, however, is slightly higher for women than for men. Among women, the highest engagement in such activities is by women in a couple with children and, among men, the highest participation is by single men. 21 % of children under the age of three are enrolled in childcare, as are 80 % of children between the age of three and school age. Therefore, Cyprus has not met either of the two \u2018Barcelona targets\u2019, which are to have at least 33 % of children below the age of three in childcare and 90 % of children between the age of three and school age in childcare.

        "4 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Power The score in the domain of power shows a marked increase as a result of the considerable improvement in the sub-domain of economic power. However, it remains the domain with the lowest score for Cyprus. The representation of women on the corporate boards of publicly listed com- panies has slightly increased. In the finance sector, women\u2019s representation is also progressing. While women were absent from the board of the central bank in 2005, they now hold 14 % of these positions. The slight increase in the sub-domain of political power is due to the increased gender balance in the government, where women represent 8 % of ministers (up from 2 %). The share of women in parliament is unchanged (14 %), but has slightly deteriorated in local assemblies. A quarter of the board members of research-funding organisations and about one tenth of the board members of publicly owned broadcasting organisa- tions are women. The gender gap in decision-making in sport is even greater \u2014 women comprise just 4 % of members of the highest decision-making bodies of national Olympic sport organisations. Health In the domain of health, the increase in the score is equally driven by the sub-domains of status and access. The sub-domain of status includes perceived health, life expectancy and healthy life years. All these indicators have progressed, both for women and for men, and the gender gaps have narrowed. Almost 80 % of women and men evaluate their health as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019. Only 20 % of women with disabilities and 26 % of men with disabilities rate their health as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019. Fewer single women are satisfied with their health (55 %), rating it as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019, than single men (71 %). Such a gap is marginal between women and men in a couple, with and without children. Satisfaction with health increases with education levels among both women and men. On average women live 4 years longer than men (84 years and 80 years, respectively). Women and men have the same number of healthy life years (63 years). Access to medical and dental services has improved for both women and men. The gender gap has narrowed and the level of access is now the same for both genders (around 98 % for medical needs and 95 % for dental needs). 22 % of lone mothers have unmet needs for dental examination. Nearly half of men engage in risky behaviour (smoking and/or harmful drink- ing) compared to less than one fifth of women. However, slightly more men than women engage in health-enhancing behaviour (doing physical activities and/or consuming fruit and vegetables).

        "5 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Violence Violence against women is included in the Gender Equality Index as a satellite domain. This means that the scores of the domain of violence do not have an impact on the final score of the Gender Equality Index. From a statistical perspective, the domain of violence does not measure gaps between women and men as core domains do. Rather, it measures and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. Unlike other domains, the overall objective is not to reduce the gaps of violence between women and men, but to eradicate violence completely. A high score in the Gender Equality Index means a country is close to achieving a gender-equal soci- ety. However, in the domain of violence, the higher the score, the more serious the phenomenon of violence against women in the country is. On a scale of 1 to 100, 1 represents a situation where violence is non-existent and 100 represents a situ- ation where violence against women is extremely common, highly severe and not disclosed. The best-performing country is therefore the one with the lowest score. Cyprus\u2019s score for the domain of violence is 24.7, which is slightly lower than the EU average. In Cyprus, 22 % of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. 51 % of respondents who have experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15 experienced health consequences as a result. 20 % of women who have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by any perpetrator in the past 12 months have not told anyone. This rate is higher than the EU-28 average of 13 %. At societal level, violence against women costs Cyprus an estimated EUR 385 million per year through lost economic output, service utilisation and personal costs (2). The domain of violence is made up of three sub-domains: prevalence , which measures how often violence against women occurs; severity , which meas- ures the health consequences of violence; and disclosure , which measures the reporting of violence. (2) This is an exercise done at EU level to estimate the costs of the three major dimensions: services, lost economic output and pain and suffering of the victims. The estimates were extrapolated to the EU from a United Kingdom case study, based on population size.
