        "EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. TAKING A STAND FOR HUMANITY. SAKHAROV PRIZE FOR FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 2012 ",
        "Martin Schulz President of the European Parliament ",
        "3 Over the last two decades, the European Union has recognised and awarded the efforts of those people and organisations that have put their lives at the service of the advancement of freedom of thought. The Sakharov Prize has become a symbol for all those who fight oppression, authoritarianism and human rights violations. This Prize embodies the European Parliament\u2019s lasting and unflinching support for those individuals who have shown exceptional strength and courage in facing oppression and arbitrary rule. Four of the final six nominees for the 2012 Sakharov Prize are serving prison sentences. They were detained, sentenced and jailed for deeds that the European Parliament encourages. As Andrei Sakharov once stated, \u2018intellectual freedom is essential to human society \u2013 freedom to obtain and distribute information, freedom for open minded and un-fearing debate and freedom from pressure by officialdom and prejudices.\u2019 The awarding of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought 2012 to Nasrin Sotoudeh and Jafar Panahi is a message of solidarity and admiration to a woman and a man who have not been bowed by fear and intimidation and who have decided to put the fate of their country before their own. Nasrin Sotoudeh is today incarcerated in the infamous Evin prison. Following a number of hunger strikes, she is in a weak and frail state, and has endured poor and repressive conditions in detention. Her work as a human rights lawyer, which demonstrated generosity and selflessness, has been met with brutal punishment. Jafar Panahi is an award-winning film director who has been sentenced to six years in prison, with a ban from making films for the next twenty years. His humorous and accurate depiction of his fellow citizens has revealed to the world how rich, creative and diverse the Iranian society is. He was first arrested in 2009, following his support for the protesters who had been killed when demonstrating against the presidential election. The awarding of the Sakharov Prize to Sotoudeh and Panahi also serves as recognition to all those Iranians who are struggling for a better Iran: an Iran where creativity has replaced fear, where the rule of law has replaced the rule of the powerful, where dialogue has replaced isolation and where democracy has replaced autocracy. The European Parliament shall continue to endeavour to bring the Sakharov Laureates together to support each other in their fight for democratic freedoms and in the defence of human rights. We hope that through this network, we will be able to provide a safe harbour for all those who cherish freedom of thought and to strengthen the message of peace, tolerance and freedom which is dear to all European citizens. FOREWORD ",
        "4 The European Union is founded on the principles of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values, enshrined in the Treaty on European Union are common to all Member States and are legally binding. Member States found in serious breach of these values may, with the European Parliament\u2019s consent, face the suspension of rights deriving from the Treaties of the EU. In its relations with the wider world, the Union is bound to uphold and promote its values and interests and contribute to the protection of its citizens, to peace, security, the sustainable development of the Earth, solidarity and mutual respect among peoples, free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child, as well as to the strict observance and the development of international law, including respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter. Vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, the Treaty defines the development and strengthening of democracy and the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as being amongst the most important objectives of the common foreign and security policy and development cooperation policy. This objective has been explicitly incorporated into the Treaty largely in response to pressure from the European Parliament, which has been at the forefront of EU action for human rights, also due to the appeals it receives from citizens inside and outside the EU and the many and varied activities of non-governmental organisations. The Lisbon Treaty, amending the Treaty on European Union, incorporated and brought into force in 2009 the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Lisbon Treaty also provided the legal basis for the EU as a whole to become party to the European Convention on Human Rights, which was opened to signature by the member states of the Council of Europe in 1950. All 27 Member States of the EU and Croatia, which is due to accede to the Union in 2013, have ratified the ECHR. The Convention itself has been amended at Article 59 to allow the European Union to accede, and the procedure is underway. According to the draft agreement reached during 2011, the EU would have one judge on the bench of the European Court of Human Rights, the judicial organ of the ECHR, and 18 Members of the European Parliament would take part in the process of the selection of judges overseen by the Council of Europe\u2019s parliamentary assembly. The Charter, the ECHR and the United Nations` Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the covenants based on it are the most important reference documents for the European Union, the European Parliament and the Member States when dealing with issues of international law in the sphere of human rights. Soon after the Union\u2019s annual human rights report is published by the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament draws up an annual report on the human rights situation in the world and the Union\u2019s human rights policy. The Subcommittee on Human Rights, in the Committee of Foreign Affairs, is the Parliament body responsible EUROPEAN UNION: THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ",
        "5 for parliamentary initiatives in this sphere and provides a permanent forum for discussions with human rights defenders on the human rights situation and democracy in non-member states. In addition, the Development Committee holds regular meetings about human rights in developing countries or on specific subjects such as child soldiers or child slaves, where both human rights NGOs and representatives of governments concerned take part. The Development Committee, together with the Foreign Affairs Committee and its Subcommittee on Human Rights, participate in the nomination and selection of the short list of candidates for the annual Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The winner is decided by the Conference of Presidents of the Political Groups of the European Parliament. Human rights violations in non-member states, in particular, individual cases, are dealt with in Parliament\u2019s monthly debates on urgent subjects and the governments involved are urged to take action. The reactions of the governments concerned suggest that they are not insensitive to criticism from the European Parliament. Its resolutions sometimes have an immediate impact and often serve as the basis for action by the Union\u2019s Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European External Action Service. Parliament\u2019s legislative powers allow it to block the conclusion of important agreements with non-member states if there are serious breaches of human rights and democratic principles. In line with this, Parliament insists on strict compliance with the human rights clauses that are systematically included in such agreements. In September 2011, the EU Association and Cooperation Agreement with Syria was suspended on human rights grounds. Parliament has strengthened its role by adopting political resolutions, holding hearings with civil society representatives from non-member states, sending ad hoc delegations to assess the human rights situation on the ground in different countries and supporting parliamentary democracy and parliamentary political dialogue, primarily through inter-parliamentary delegations and assemblies. At their regular meetings with Members of Parliament from partner countries, the Members of the European Parliament frequently discuss individual cases, and have on occasion obtained positive results. The main forum for political dialogue between the European Parliament and Members of Parliament from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries is the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean provides the platform for a structured dialogue on issues of human rights and democracy with Mediterranean countries, and a forum for discussion of long-running disputes. The Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, EuroLat, adopts and submits resolutions and recommendations to the various organizations, institutions and ministerial groups responsible for the development of the bi-regional strategic association. It deals with questions relating to democracy, external policy, governance, integration, peace and human rights. The Euronest Parliamentary Assembly is the parliamentary forum for the promotion of political association and further economic integration between the European 5 ",
        "Union and the Eastern European partners. Set up in 2011, it has a standing committee on human rights and democracy. The European Parliament also closely monitors the work of the UN Human Rights Council set up in June 2006, and contributes to establishing the issues the EU raises in its sessions. Parliament in fact plays a decisive role in putting human rights issues on the European agenda. It takes specific initiatives in a range of areas such as preventing torture, the protection of minorities, conflict prevention, promoting women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, the protection of human rights\u2019 defenders, the rights of indigenous peoples and people with disabilities. The European Parliament actively supports the campaign for a UN moratorium on executions and the worldwide abolition of the death penalty and the International Criminal Court in its fight against impunity for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It backed the setting-up of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, later replaced by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights on 1 March 2007, and the EU campaign to combat violence against women. It is actively involved in the democratisation processes in third countries through diligent participation in election observation missions and the work of its Office for the Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy. The European Parliament will also be closely interacting with the newly-established European Endowment for Democracy. The European Parliament has already used its budgetary powers to substantially increase the resources earmarked for programmes dealing with democracy and human rights. It successfully fought for the maintenance of a separate instrument to finance such activities: the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. This is a financial and policy instrument contributing to the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, the respect of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in non-EU Member States all over the world, and includes a special focus on civil society organisations. The European Parliament also attaches great importance to the furtherance of citizens\u2019 economic and social rights within the Union. The human rights situation within the EU is dealt with by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. It works on measures to combat racism, religious intolerance and xenophobia and the treatment of asylum seekers and migrant workers. Furthermore, if EU citizens consider that their fundamental rights have been violated, they can take the matter up with the European Ombudsman or the Petitions Committee of the European Parliament. The Ombudsman deals with complaints relating to the activities of EU bodies, whereas the Petitions Committee deals with petitions concerning breaches of their obligations by Member States. The latter are frequently required to modify their legislation or practices to conform with Community law as a result of subsequent treaty infringement proceedings. The European Parliament annually highlights the struggles and bravery of human rights defenders, dissidents and activists involved in the fight for human rights and fundamental freedoms through its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. In 2008 the Sakharov Prize celebrated its 20th anniversary. In order to mark this event the European Parliament held a conference entitled: 6 ",
        "7 20 years of active support to human rights: Sakharov Laureates tell their story. Many of the Laureates participated in this conference and shared their views on global human rights, and the impact of the Sakharov Prize. Hauwa Ibrahim, a 2005 Laureate, used her prize money to send over 100 children to school. Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo, the 1992 Laureates, used the prize to open a bookshop, a political cafe and a university for over 2400 students. Elena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov\u2019s widow, was also present at this conference. Herself a renowned human rights and democracy campaigner, Elena Bonner reaffirmed her husband\u2019s belief that \u2018people should always follow their consciences\u2019 and her own belief that \u2018human rights are the basis of civilisation.\u2019 This conference was also the launching pad for the Sakharov Prize Network by then European Parliament President Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering. HUMAN RIGHTS ",
        "8 Since 1988, in the spirit of Andrei Sakharov, the European Parliament has awarded the annual Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to honour individuals or organisations for their efforts on behalf of human rights and fundamental freedoms and against oppression and injustice. From Gorky, where he was living in exile, Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), the renowned physicist, member of the Academy of Sciences, dissident and 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner, sent a message to the European Parliament saying how moved he was that it intended to create a prize for freedom of thought which would bear his name. He rightly saw this as an encouragement to all those who, like him, had committed themselves to championing human rights. A pioneer in nuclear physics in the USSR, Andrei Sakharov became concerned at the onset of an arms race that heightened the threat of a nuclear world war hanging over the world of the Cold War era. After publishing, in samizdat form (self-printed, type-written copies) the Western press, an essay containing Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom, Sakharov was banned from all military-related research. In 1970 he became one of the co-founders of the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR and married fellow human rights activist Elena Bonner in 1972. Despite increasing pressure from the government, Sakharov not only sought the release of dissenters in his country but became one of the regime\u2019s most courageous critics, embodying the crusade against the denial of fundamental rights. He was, in the words of the Nobel Peace Committee, \u2018a spokesman for the conscience of mankind.\u2019 Neither intimidation nor exile could break his resistance. Like Andrei Sakharov, all the winners of the prize which bears his name have demonstrated just how much courage, patience and inner strength is needed to defend human rights and campaign for their universal recognition. Almost all have paid dearly for their commitment to defending human dignity, and many have faced persecution, loss of personal freedom, beatings or exile. In a number of cases the winners have not been free to receive their prize in person. In awarding the Sakharov Prize, the European Parliament honours outstanding achievements in the fight to protect freedom of thought and expression against intolerance, fanaticism and hatred. This reflects its conviction that fundamental freedoms include not only the right to life and physical integrity, but also freedom of expression and of the press, two of the most effective means of fighting oppression and key yardsticks by which to judge whether a society is democratic and open. The right to untrammelled freedom of opinion and expression, enshrined in Article 19 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 16 December 1966, which states that \u2018everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\u2019, reflects the spirit in which the European Parliament created the Sakharov Prize. The European Parliament awards the human rights prize, endowed with EUR 50 000, at a formal sitting in Strasbourg which falls on or around 10 December, the day on which the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights was signed in 1948. ANDREI SAKHAROV INSPIRATION FOR THE PRIZE ",
        "9 SAKHAROV PRIZE NETWORK On 2008, on the 20th anniversary of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering, then president of the European Parliament, officially launched the Sakharov Prize Network, as a platform for laureates to connect with one another\u2019s activities and show solidarity. In order to mark this event the European Parliament held a conference entitled: 20 years of active support to human rights: Sakharov Laureates tell their story. The Laureates signed a joint declaration in which they \u2018agreed to enhance joint efforts in support of human rights defenders around the world through common actions by the Sakharov Prize winners jointly and in cooperation with the European Parliament.\u2019 The Network has enhanced its activities with the High Level Conference of November 2011, to which all the Laureates were invited. At the Sakharov Prize Network Annual Event of October 2012, the current co-chairpersons of the Network, European Parliament President Martin Schulz and 2011 Laureates Ali Ferzat, Asmaa Mahfouz and Ahmed El Senussi, debated publicly their views on Democracy in the Making. The Laureates were also speakers at the first World Forum for Democracy in Strasbourg, held under the patronage inter alia of the European Parliament. 2013 will see the 25th anniversary celebration of the Sakharov Prize. Laureates from all over the world who are enjoying their freedom will be converging on Brussels to discuss their struggles and strengthen and enrich each other in the Sakharov Prize Network Conference. 9 ",

        "NASRIN SOTOUDEH JAFAR PANAHI SAKHAROV PRIZE FOR FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 2012 ",
        "12 SAKHAROV PRIZE FOR FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 2012: NASRIN SOTOUDEH AND JAFAR PANAHI Nasrin Sotoudeh is a human rights lawyer currently serving a six-year sentence in the notorious Evin prison for fearlessly defending dissenters arrested in the 2009 mass protests against the presidential election they believed was fraudulent. Political prisoners sought her representation because she was strong enough and brave enough to stand up to the judicial authorities and intelligence officers. She is also a strong opponent of the death penalty for minors. Sotoudeh, 45, is now in a frail condition following hunger strikes in protest against pressure on her family and harsh prison conditions. In a letter to her children Mehrvaeh and Nima, published on persian2english.com, Nasrin said she was in pain from not being able to hear their voices. \u2018Next to all my social and professional identities, I am proud of being a mother, especially to you two\u2019 but \u2018I do not want my children to see me in a forced, coerced, and humiliating form. I do not want my children to think that others can subject them to an illegal act by abusing power.\u2019 She had been forbidden a family visit for refusing to be forced to wear the chador, which, unlike the hijab, is not required by law. Jafar Panahi is a film-maker who has been banned from making films for 20 years. An outspoken supporter of the Iranian opposition Green movement and a critic of President Ahmedinajad, he was also sentenced to six years in prison for \u201cpropaganda against the Islamic Republic.\u201d He now lives in a sort of limbo, banned from leaving the country or talking to the media and yet fighting the curbs to his freedom of expession. Inspired by realism and a humanistic perspective on life, Jafar Panahi, 51, has focused his lens on the hardship of life in Iran for children, the impoverished and especially women since the Islamic revolution, incurring the wrath and censorship of the Iranian authorities. His films, award-winning in Cannes and Venice, are banned at home and have landed him in jail more than once. In 2010 he was arrested together with his wife, daughter and 15 friends, all later released. In 2011 he shot This is not a Film showing him sitting at his kitchen table, talking to his lawyer, waiting to be jailed. The feature was a surprise entry at the Cannes Film Festival, smuggled out of Iran on a USB stick hidden in a cake. As British-Iranian comic Omid Djalili put it: \u2018it\u2019s a gift, it\u2019s a laugh: it says a lot about the spirit of the man.\u2019 12 ",
        "13 1988 Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, 1993 Nobel Peace Laureate, born in 1918 in Umtata, South Africa, was elected President and Head of Government of the Republic of South Africa in the first free elections in 1994. He had spent the greater part of his life behind bars. As leader of the ANC (African National Congress), he symbolised, for his fellow countrymen and the public worldwide, the resistance of black people to the oppressive apartheid regime. When he was awarded the prize in 1988 Mandela was still under house arrest. Retired from public life since June 1999, he remains committed to his ideals and values through his two charities, the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Children\u2019s Fund, as well as in the Global Elders initiative which he launched on 18 July 2007 in Johannesburg together with Gra\u00e7a Machel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. This project includes a group of world leaders, peace activists and human rights advocates whose goal is to solve global problems, using \u2018almost 1000 years of collective experience to dream up solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems like climate change, HIV/AIDS, and poverty\u2019 and \u2018use their political independence to help resolve some of the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts.\u2019 In his address during a Parliament sitting to mark 10 years of democracy in South Africa, Nelson Mandela said: \u2018a guiding principle in our search for and establishment of a non-racial inclusive democracy in our country has been that there are good men and women to be found in all groups and from all sectors of society; and that in an open and free society those South Africans will come together to jointly and cooperatively realise the common good. Historical enemies succeeded in negotiating a peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy exactly because we were prepared to accept the inherent capacity for goodness in the other.\u2019 In 2012, the University of South Africa honoured the former president in absentia with its Robben Island Alumnus Award in a formal acknowledgement of his commitment to social justice and ethical leadership. 1988 Anatoli Marchenko Anatoli Marchenko (1938 -1986), one of the former Soviet Union\u2019s best-known dissidents, died in Chistopol prison in December 1986 as the result of a hunger strike after more than 20 years in prison. He was a member of the group founded in 1975 to campaign for compliance with the Helsinki Final Act, particularly the clauses relating to the human dimension, security and cooperation. He revealed the truth about the Soviet labour camps and prisons, but this earned him a prison sentence for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda. \u201cThe only way to fight the prevailing evil and illegality is, in my view, to know the truth.\u201d 1989 Alexander Dub \u010d ek In 1989, the European Parliament honoured Alexander Dub\u010dek (1921-1992), one of the catalysts behind the process of renewal and change in the former Eastern Block and the leading figure in the reform movement which became known as the \u201cPrague Spring.\u201d His endeavours to give Socialism a \u201chuman face\u201d were shattered on 21 August 1968 by the Warsaw Pact forces entering Czechoslovakia, seizing control of Prague and the Central Committee\u2019s building, and taking him briefly into Soviet custody. Dub\u010dek was accused of treason, stripped of office and expelled from the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; he spent the years up to 1985 as an ordinary worker. In 1988 he returned to political life as a civil rights activist. After the revolution in Czechoslovakia, Dub\u010dek was elected President of the Federal Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia. As one of the figures who also kept hope alive for the Soviet dissidents in their long struggle for glasnost, as Andrei Sakharov described him in a message read out during the award ceremony in January 1990, Dub\u010dek expressed the wish that \u2018as a result of the Prague Spring the great symphony of the European community spirit will continue to resound in 1990 and in all the years to come.\u2019 ",
        "1990 Aung San Suu Kyi Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s leadership of Myanmar\u00b4s pro-democracy struggle was recognised by the award of the Sakharov Prize in 1990, a year before she was also awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1991. An international symbol of peaceful resistance in the face of oppression, Suu Kyi, born in 1947, spent most of the two decades after 1990 under house arrest or in prison after Myanmar\u2019s ruling military junta cracked down with arrests and bloody reprisals on her National League for Democracy, refusing to hand over power to it despite its overwhelming victory in that year\u2019s election. She was still under house arrest during Myanmar\u2019s first elections in two decades on 7 November 2010, but was released six days later. As the country\u2019s new government began democratic reforms, Suu Kyi stood for a parliamentary by-election in April 2012, in which she and her party won 43 out of the 45 seats available. On 3rd May 2012, Suu Kyi was sworn in Parliament. She is now the leader of Myanmar\u2019s parliamentary opposition. On her electoral victory, the European Parliament stated \u2018its great respect for the long struggle over decades of opposition leader and Sakharov Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019 and applauded her courage and tenacity as \u2018an example of selfless courage and struggle for freedom and democracy in the face of tyranny.\u2019 The EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT welcomed the dialogue between the government and opposition. Parliament had on several occasions called for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other Burmese political prisoners and condemned the systematic violations of the human rights, fundamental freedoms and basic democratic rights of the people of Burma/Myanmar. Since democratic reforms began in the country, hundreds of political prisoners have been released and media censorship lifted. Aung San Suu Kyi has been named head of a 15-member parliamentary committee tasked with helping to implement the rule of law in the country. She considers a strong, independent and clean judiciary as key to democratisation: \u2018once we can say that we have been able to re-establish rule of law, then we can say that the process of democratization has succeeded.\u2019 Since her release Suu Kyi has been able to travel, and the European Parliament has renewed its invitation for Aung San Suu Kyi to visit it and receive her 1990 Sakharov Prize. 1991 Adem Dema\u00e7i In 1991 Parliament awarded its human rights prize to Adem Dema\u00e7i, a Kosovar born in Pri\u0161tina in 1936, thereby honouring a man who had spent the greater part of his life (1958-1990) in prison for fighting for the fundamental rights of the Albanians in Kosovo by means of the written and spoken word. But prison could not silence Dema\u00e7i: he continued to raise his voice to make known the bitter truth about the Serbian oppression of the two million Albanians in Kosovo. \u2018Freedom of speech (is) the first, crucial step towards democracy. Without freedom of speech there is no dialogue, without dialogue the truth cannot be established, and without the truth progress is impossible.\u2019 After his release, Adem Dema\u00e7i assumed the leadership of the Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms. From 1998 to 1999, during the Serb offensive, he was the political representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK). Since the war, he has devoted himself mainly to ethnic reconciliation and the return of refugees. He took on the chairmanship of the Committee for Mutual Understanding, Tolerance and Coexistence, representing all ethnic groups in Kosovo, \u2018because Kosovo belongs to everyone\u2019 and \u2018we want a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.\u2019 To date he is involved in politics in Kosovo. 1992 Las Madres de la plaza de Mayo This Argentinian human rights movement grew spontaneously through the search for \u201cdisappeared\u201d children during Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war,\u201d a seven-year period of unprecedented human rights abuses following a military coup in 1976. Mothers queuing outside the Interior Ministry searching for their children began to find strength in each other, and at a time of severe repression, when it was forbidden even to stand together in a group, the mothers held their first protest by walking slowly in a counter clockwise circle in the Plaza de Mayo. Fourteen women held the first protest, but as this evolved into a weekly event on Thursday afternoons, hundreds of mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and friends joined them in their weekly march. The women wore scarves with their children\u2019s names embroidered on them, in a strong visual symbol of their cause. 14 ",
        "15 They stuck bravely to their passive and peaceful resistance even when 12 of their number disappeared by the end of 1977, amongst them Azucena Villaflor, the Mothers\u2019 first leader, and two other founding Mothers, Esther Careaga and Mar\u00eca Eugenia Bianco. The Mother\u2019s peaceful resistance helped bring down the military regime, and the trials and imprisonment of some of those responsible for crimes against humanity in Argentina in the 1970s are a result of their unceasing efforts. Their struggle has now taken on an amplified dimension. The Argentinians mothers wish to see the country\u2019s young people show political commitment and oppose a system which has condemned millions of Argentinians to poverty and provides neither education, nor housing nor health care. They fight for an independent judicial system and political change, taking up their disappeared children\u2019s ideals. At their continued demonstrations every Thursday in front of the President\u2019s residence at the Casa Rosada, the Madres now wear blank white headscarves, symbolising the universality of their struggle. Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo has set up a People\u2019s University, a bookshop, a library and a cultural centre. In 1999, the organization was awarded the Unesco Prize for Peace Education. 1993 Oslobodjenje The daily newspaper Oslobodjenje, founded in 1943, was the winner of the Sakharov Prize in 1993. Despite deaths and injuries among their colleagues and the destruction of the newspaper\u2019s offices by Serbian artillery, some 70 journalists \u2013 Muslims, Serbs and Croats \u2013 continued to work in a nuclear shelter in the cellar of their building in Sarajevo, risking their lives so that Oslobodjenje could continue to appear. Zlatko Disdarevi\u0107, one of the editors at the time, and later an ambassador for Bosnia, said that Oslobodjenje\u2019s aim was to preserve and defend Bosnia-Herzegovina as a multiethnic state. \u2018Our efforts were directed against death and against the partition or even complete eradication of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the map. The people of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to fight against the partition which has its roots in the Europe that existed before the Great War.\u2019 Oslobodjenje (Liberation), took its name from the newspaper founded by partisans fighting the German occupation of Yugoslavia, and it was for a long time one of the few independent newspapers in the country. 1994 Taslima Nasreen When the doctor and writer Taslima Nasreen, who was born in 1962 in Bangladesh, won the 1994 Sakharov Prize, she had already sought refuge in Europe. Her works, which criticise religious fundamentalism and particularly the oppression of women, are banned in her country. Islamic fundamentalists have issued threats against her life. In her acceptance speech, she said she came from a part of the world where social tensions and human difficulties were unbearable. As a writer, she could not close her eyes to the daily suffering and starvation in the slums. In September 1998 Taslima Nasreen returned to Bangladesh to her dying mother. As soon as this news came out, religious fundamentalists once again called for the writer to be put to death. A court issued a warrant for her arrest and threatened to confiscate her assets. The European Parliament answered Taslima Nasreen\u2019s appeal for help and, in a resolution, called on the government of Bangladesh to protect her life and ensure her safety. In January 1999, in the face of continuing threats, Nasreen left her homeland once again. Since 1994, Taslima Nasreen has lived in many countries in exile including France, Sweden and India. Even there, she came under increasing pressure from Muslim groups for her \u201canti-Islamic\u201d novels and memoirs, forcing her to move to New Delhi and live under Indian government security protection from November 2007. Due to increasing death threats by Islamic extremists and her struggles with residence permits for India, Taslima Nasreen was eventually forced to leave India in mid-March 2008, only to return for short periods. In 2009, the Mayor of Paris authorised Taslima Nasreen to stay in his city. Despite the continued denial of her right to return to Bangladesh, she often speaks about her desire to go back to her country. ",
        "16 1995 Leyla Zana When the European Parliament awarded Leyla Zana the Sakharov Prize in 1995 for her courageous defence of human rights and commitment to forging a peaceful, democratic resolution to conflicts between the Turkish Government and its Kurdish population, she had already spent one year under imprisonment. In the course of defending the rights of her imprisoned husband, Zana had assumed a leadership role, which culminated in her candidacy in the Turkish parliamentary elections of 1991. She received 84 percent of the votes in her district of Diyarbakir. At her inauguration, she promised in Kurdish to \u2018struggle so that the Kurdish and Turkish peoples may live together in a democratic framework.\u2019 In December 1994, the Ankara State Security Court charged Leyla Zana, together with three other Kurdish MPs of the pro-Kurdish Party for Democracy with affiliation in the outlawed PKK, on the basis of her speeches and writings in defence of Kurdish rights. She was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. The government offered her release in 1997 for health reasons, but Zana refused, expressing a wish for a \u2018general amnesty for all political prisoners\u2019 and stating \u2018I do not wish to be released on health grounds while my political friends remain in captivity.\u2019 After the retrial in 2003, which, like the first trial, was considered by the European Court of Human Rights as not being fair and independent, the court decided that the former Kurdish MPs should serve the remainder of their prison sentences. However, in 2004 Turkey\u2019s Appeal Court revoked the convictions. Thus, on 14 October 2004, Leyla Zana was finally able to address a European Parliament plenary session in person at a special ceremony in Brussels and collect her Sakharov Prize. In December 2008, Leyla Zana was sentenced to another 10 years of imprisonment for allegedly spreading terrorist propaganda but her conviction was overturned by an appeals court on the ground that she had not had an adequate opportunity to defend herself. In May 2012, she was given another ten-year prison sentence on being found guilty of \u2018spreading terrorist propaganda.\u2019 As a Member of Parliament, re-elected as a Kurdish Member of Parliament in the general election on 12 June 2011 \u2013 she enjoys parliamentary immunity until the next election in 2015. 1996 Wei Jingsheng The \u201cfather of the Chinese democracy movement\u201d was the 1996 winner of the Sakharov Prize. China\u2019s most prominent dissident was born into the family of a civil servant on 20 May 1950, initially joined the Red Guard as an enthusiastic supporter of the ideals of the Maoist Cultural Revolution, but, disillusioned by the atrocities committed in the name of the class struggle, turned instead to humanism and democracy. When Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978, Wei Jingsheng helped to create the \u201cWall of Democracy.\u201d In wall newspapers, Chinese citizens called for the injustices they had suffered to be made right. \u2018What is real democracy?\u2019 asked Wei on a poster, attracting the attention and wrath of the Chinese Government. When, in 1979, he called Deng Xiaoping a dictator in the mould of Mao Zedong, he was arrested, convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes at a show trial and sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and hard labour. After his release in 1993, Wei Jingsheng did not give up. He set up links with the Western media and continued to denounce the flagrant human rights violations in China. In 1994 he vanished into police custody, and at the end of 1995 he was once again sentenced to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment for plotting to overthrow Communism. His health steadily deteriorated as a result of inhuman prison conditions and ill-treatment by fellow prisoners. On 16 November 1997, as a result of persistent international pressure, Wei Jingsheng was released from prison and deported to the USA. As chairman of the Overseas Chinese Democracy Coalition (OCDC), founded in 1998, and through his own Wei Jingsheng Foundation, he is still campaigning to achieve his overriding objective: human rights and democracy in China.

        "1997 Salima Ghezali Salima Ghezali, the 1997 winner of the Sakharov Prize, was born near Algiers in 1958. In the 1980s she became involved in the Algerian women\u2019s movement, amongst other things as a founder member of Women of Europe and the Maghreb and as editor-in-chief of NYSSA, the women\u2019s publication she herself had founded. The women\u2019s rights activist became a committed campaigner for human rights and democracy in Algeria. After 1994, as publisher of the weekly magazine La Nation, she increasingly focused on issues of censorship. Her articles constantly called for a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis in Algeria, which had cost the lives of tens of thousands of people, including many journalists. As a result, she became a target for criticism from both the Algerian authorities and Islamic extremists. The appearance in Le Monde Diplomatique of her report on the human rights situation in Algeria prompted the authorities to order the closure of her magazine in 1996. Salima Ghezali, in reaction, stated that \u2018drawing attention to the principles which form the foundations of our human society and exercising vigilance are the best means of ensuring that civilisation wins out over barbarism.\u2019 On 25 April 1996, at a hearing on press freedom held by the European Parliament, Salima Ghezali described the fear and pressures to which journalists in Algeria were exposed if they tried to circumvent censorship and escape the murderous wrath of their opponents. In 2002, shortly before the publication of La Nation was to resume, she confirmed that the weekly magazine would continue to campaign for the opening up of Algeria to democracy in the future. Salima Ghezali has been a Board member of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation of Support to Human Rights Defenders (EMHRF) and continues her activism on women\u2019s rights, human rights and democracy in Algeria. 1998 Ibrahim Rugova In 1998, as the armed conflict between Serbian units and the Kosovo Liberation Army escalated, the European Parliament sent out a message by awarding the Sakharov Prize to the political leader of the Kosovo Albanians. In giving the prize to Ibrahim Rugova, the European Parliament honoured a man committed to the principle of peaceful resistance to violence. Dr Ibrahim Rugova, who was born on 2 December 1944 in Cerrca (Istog), Kosovo, taught literature at the University of Pri\u0161tina before being elected leader of the Kosovo Democratic Alliance (LDK) in 1989. That year, Belgrade abolished the autonomous status of the province of Kosovo; the Albanians found themselves subjected to oppression, and opposition leaders were arrested. In 1990 the two million Kosovo Albanians adopted their own constitution. In a 1991 referendum 97% of them voted for an independent Kosovo, and in 1998 they confirmed Ibrahim Rugova as President of their self-proclaimed \u201cRepublic of Kosovo.\u201d The pacifist Rugova stuck doggedly to his approach based on non-violent opposition to the Serbian regime, constantly reiterating his willingness to enter into dialogue with Belgrade. At the same time, he endeavoured to win over world opinion to his people\u2019s cause. He never faltered in urging the international community to step up its pressure and offer Kosovo protection. Convinced that his people could achieve self-determination only through peace, on 18 March 1999 Ibrahim Rugova signed the Rambouillet peace agreement as the chief negotiator for the Kosovo Albanians. Belgrade\u2019s refusal to endorse the agreement led on 24 March to the launch of NATO attacks on Yugoslavia, which led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. On 28 March Rugova\u2019s key adviser in the peace negotiations, Fehmi Agani, was murdered in Pri\u0161tina. Rugova himself was forced to go underground. In March 2002 Ibrahim Rugova was elected as the first President of Kosovo. President Rugova died of cancer on 21 January 2006. 17 ",
        "1999 Jos\u00e9 Alexandre \u201cXanana\u201d Gusm\u00e3o Xanana Gusm\u00e3o was born on 20 June 1946 in Laleia, East Timor. When the Portuguese withdrew, Indonesia began a policy of destabilising East Timor. On 7 December 1975, Indonesia invaded. Gusm\u00e3o went underground and in 1978 became leader of the military wing of the Revolutionary Front for the Independence of East Timor (FRETILIN). The violence which accompanied the invasion cost an estimated 200 000 lives, but failed to break the people\u2019s determination to resist. Xanana Gusm\u00e3o sought to secure a peaceful solution to the conflict by proposing a peace plan and talks under UN supervision to the Indonesian Government. In 1986 he managed to bring together the various political and social groupings to form the Timorese National Resistance Council (TNRC). On 20 November 1992 Xanana Gusm\u00e3o was arrested. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, subsequently reduced to 20 years, on charges of separatism and illegal possession of arms and ultimately, in February 1999, was placed under house arrest. Even the imprisonment of Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, who is also known as the \u201cMandela of Timor,\u201d failed to break the opposition in East Timor. In releasing Xanana Gusm\u00e3o on 7 September 1999 \u2013 shortly after the referendum of 30 August, in which 80% of the population of East Timor had voted for independence \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s President Habibie was responding to massive international pressure. Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, who had become a symbol of resistance in East Timor and the embodiment of the hopes of the international solidarity movement, said on his release: \u2018as a free man, I promise to do everything in my power to bring peace to East Timor and my people.\u2019 In April 2002 the first free presidential elections were held in East Timor. Xanana Gusm\u00e3o was elected with almost 83% of the votes and the same year he received the North \u2013 South Prize of the Council of Europe. On 20 May 2002 Kofi Annan officially declared the Democratic Republic of East Timor an independent state. Jos\u00e9 Xanana Gusm\u00e3o served as President of East Timor, or Timor Leste, until May 2007, and became Prime Minister of the country following the legislative elections of 30 June 2007. In 2008 Xanana Gusm\u00e3o survived an assassination attempt against him. In September 2012, he told the UN General Assembly that Timor Leste aimed to rise out of poverty and become a prosperous country by 2030. 2000 \u00a1BASTA YA! The pressure group BASTA YA (Enough is Enough), which was granted consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council in July 2004, consists of people who work for basic human rights, democracy and tolerance in the Basque country. Members of the group come from different ideological backgrounds but agree on these stances: | against terrorism of any sort, regardless of origin or intensity; | support for all victims of terrorism or of political violence; | defence of the rule of law, the constitution and the statute of autonomy of the Basque country. Fundamental freedoms and human rights are under threat in the Basque country from terrorism by ETA and related groups. Thousands of people have been victims of intimidation, extortion, blackmail and attacks, with families and property also targeted. They are unable to express themselves freely or exercise their rights without taking great risks. The members of BASTA YA are risking their lives to fight terrorism and the only \u201cweapon\u201d they have is the peaceful mobilisation of the people to protect their basic freedoms. BASTA YA aims to raise awareness through actions designed to display solidarity with all those who oppose terrorism and support democratic values. In March 2002 the group\u2019s spokesman, Fernando Savater, told the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs that, after 25 years of daily struggle, the people had had enough and, in the past ten years, 10% of the population had already left the Basque country. Basta Ya states that it would dearly wish to be able to dissolve itself as soon as possible because it had become unnecessary. Until then, whilst the threat of terrorism still hangs over the Basque country and citizens live in an atmosphere of extortion and permanent violence, Basta Ya remains determined to carry on functioning and calling on all citizens to mobilise whenever necessary. 18 ",
        "19 2001 Izzat Ghazzawi A Palestinian born in 1951, Izzat Ghazzawi was a professor at Birzeit University and held a master\u2019s degree in English literature. He chaired the Union of Palestinian Writers, wrote novels and short stories, was a literary critic and organised and chaired the first International Writers\u2019 Conference in Palestine (1997). Izzat Ghazzawi was a member of the Executive Bureau of the Palestinian Council for Justice and Peace and was awarded the International Prize for Freedom of Expression in Stavanger in 1995. He was imprisoned and punished on a number of occasions by the Israeli authorities as a result of his political activities. His life was marked by the killing, by the Israeli Army, of his son Ramy, aged 16. Ramy was killed in the courtyard of his school as he went to help a wounded friend. Despite this tragedy, Izzat Ghazzawi always continued to seek cultural and political dialogue with the Israeli people. Together with the Israeli writer Abraham B. Yehoshua and the photographer Oliviero Toscani, he published a book on relations between the Palestinians and the Israelis which became hugely successful. Izzat Ghazzawi died on 4 April 2003. 2001 Nurit Peled-Elhanan An Israeli born in 1949, Nurit Peled-Elhanan is a university professor of comparative literature. She represents all Israelis who are committed to a negotiated solution to the conflict and who clearly acknowledge the right of two peoples and two States to exist side by side on an equal footing. Her father is the famous General Matti Peled, who is renowned for his efforts to foster peace and progress. Her 14-year-old daughter, Smadar, was killed in an attack carried out in West Jerusalem by a Palestinian suicide bomber. When her daughter was killed, Nurit did not give in to despair but made speeches which focused on the responsibility borne by those who implement a short sighted policy that refuses to acknowledge the rights of others and fuels hatred and conflict. She founded the Israeli-Palestinian Bereaved Families Forum. Speaking to secondary school pupils in Rimini on 4 February 2004, Nurit Peled-Elhanan said \u2018it is high time that we define what is happening in the Middle East in terms of criminality rather than in political and military terms\u2026 It is time to teach how to recognise false ideals and how to oppose the terrible misuse of ideals\u2026 It is high time\u2026 for us to become individuals again instead of nations, individuals instead of troops, and to work together to save those children who are still alive by saying, \u201cenough is enough.\u201d Both Nurit Peled-Elhanan and Izzat Ghazzawi in life embodied the hope of a negotiated, peaceful solution to the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. Their personal tragedies have not turned them into enemies; their pain has not been transformed into hatred, but instead into the respect for the rights of individual citizens. 2001 Dom Zacarias Kamwenho In 1999, renewed awareness of the need to fight for peace and human rights began to increase among the Angolan people, encouraged by the efforts of church leaders and various civil society bodies to foster \u2018inclusive national reconciliation.\u2019 Archbishop Zacarias Kamwenho is in the vanguard of this peace movement. Born in Chimbundo (Huambo, Angola) in 1934, ordained in 1961, he was made Archbishop of Lubango in 1995. Dom Zacarias Kamwenho expressed his firm, impartial and determined views to all parties of the conflict in an effort to achieve lasting peace through political dialogue after 26 years of civil war. He was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 2001 in recognition of his untiring efforts for peace. The ceasefire which came about in 2002 after the killing of Jonas Savimbi, the peace talks and the general climate of support for democratisation can largely be attributed to the campaign conducted by Dom Zacarias Kamwenho and other religious and civil leaders. In 2003 Archbishop Kamwenho resigned as chair of the Bishops\u2019 Conference of Angola and S\u00e3o Tome but continued to work actively through his diocese and the Ecumenical Committee for Peace in Angola for the realisation of democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, the ",

In 2012, the now-retired archbishop called on Angolans to exercise their right to vote. 2002 Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as was honoured for his undeterred commitment to national dialogue and democratic change in Cuba. Born in 1952, he died in a car crash in July 2012. He was best known as the founder of the Varela project, a campaign to gather signatures in support of a referendum on laws guaranteeing civil rights. He also founded the Christian Liberation Movement, which continues to call for a clarification of the circumstances of his death. His family have rejected the official version of an accident due to over speeding. In life, Pay\u00e1 was a respected spokesman for the Cuban opposition, and younger and older dissidents alike paid their respects at his funeral, including Sakharov Laureates Damas de Blanco and Guillermo Fari\u00f1as. Despite being persecuted and condemned since his youth for his criticism of Fidel Castro\u2019s policies, Pay\u00e1\u2019s commitment to civil liberties was unwavering. In 1997 he drew up the Varela project calling for a national referendum on freedom of expression and assembly, free pluralist elections, the release of all political prisoners, and economic and social reforms. In so doing Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as demonstrated his support for the goal of bringing about political change using existing legal means. He and his supporters succeeded in gathering 25 000 signatures and presenting the project to the National Assembly of People\u2019s Power in May 2002. For the first time, the opposition came together to support the manifesto Todos Unidos (All Together). In March 2003, 75 Cubans \u2013 two thirds of whom had been active in the campaign for a referendum \u2013 were sentenced to long-term prison sentences for offences against national independence and territorial integrity. In his address to the European Parliament, Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as pledged a commitment that the Cuban Government\u2019s repression would not halt the campaign, as the Cuban people wanted change without violence. In July 2003, 200 Members of the European Parliament put their signatures to the Sakharov initiative giving Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as an assurance of their continuing support. On his death in 2012, European Parliament President Martin Schulz stated his belief that Oswaldo Pay\u00e1\u2019s ideas will survive as his work and commitment had inspired a generation of Cuban activists who were following his example in promoting political freedom and human rights. 2003 UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and All the staff of the United Nations In special memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello and the many other UN officials who lost their lives in execution of their service for peace in the world. In awarding the 2003 Sakharov Prize to the United Nations, the European Parliament gave recognition to the UN\u2019s endeavours for peace, human rights and fundamental freedoms and in support of democracy and the rule of law around the world. In the era of globalisation, efforts were made under Kofi Annan\u2019s leadership to develop the UN into a more efficient instrument for global needs: \u2018we will continue our efforts to tackle poverty, disease, climate change, and the spread of small arms. And we will also work together to fight terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations must confront all these threats at once.\u2019 The Sakharov Prize honoured the United Nations\u2019 members of staff who work tirelessly for world peace, often under difficult conditions. They run the risk of losing their lives and many of them have. The Prize was awarded in special memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and one of the worthiest representatives of the UN who, whilst serving as Kofi Annan\u2019s special representative in Iraq, was killed in 2003 along with other UN officials in an attack on the UN Headquarters in Baghdad. In view of the 60th anniversary of the UN, Kofi Annan launched a reflection on the reform of the UN, presenting in 2005, he presented to the UN General Assembly the report In larger freedom where he outlined his vision for a comprehensive and ",
        "extensive reform of the UN. Among other things, this resulted in the creation in March 2006 of a new Human Rights Council, to replace the old Commission on Human Rights, with the aim of strengthening the world body\u2019s machinery to promote and protect fundamental rights, and deal with major human rights offenders. After completing two five-year terms as the UN Secretary General in January 2007, Kofi Annan became involved with several organizations with global and African issues in focus. Among other things, he was appointed president of the Global Humanitarian Forum in Geneva and became a member of the Global Elders, a group of leaders who \u2018contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity to tackling some of the world\u2019s toughest problems.\u2019 As head of the Panel of Eminent African Personalities, Annan participated in the negotiations to end the civil unrest in Kenya at the beginning of 2008 and successfully achieved a resolution of the crisis whereby President Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga signed a coalition government agreement in February 2008. In 2012, he served as Joint Special Envoy of the UN and the Arab League in Syria with the goal of finding a solution to the Syrian conflict. 2004 The Belarusian Association of Journalists The Belarusian Association of Journalists\u2019 commitment to the cause of freedom of speech and the promotion of independent and professional journalism in Belarus is inspirational. Representing almost 1,000 media workers, the Association works under extremely difficult conditions to protect the legitimate rights of journalists, who are often the victims of intimidation, harassment, criminal prosecution and expatriation. In a number of individual cases, prompt intervention by the BAJ has enabled those responsible for death threats against journalists to be brought to account. Despite the lack of an independent judiciary, the BAJ\u2019s lawyers have frequently been successful in representing journalists and the media in court. An important part of the Association\u2019s work involves increasing public awareness of the constitutional right to freedom of information and of how people can exercise their rights. Through its Law Centre for Media Protection, the BAJ also works to improve the regulatory framework. On 3 May 2005, World Press Freedom Day, the Association called for support for the independent press in Belarus as the only source \u2013 given the situation in the country \u2013 of up-to-date and comprehensive information for the citizens of Belarus on what is happening in the country and the rest of the world. The Belarusian Association of Journalists continues, despite the hostility of the regime and harsh conditions in which it operates, to work for the promotion of independent journalism and freedom of speech in Belarus 2005 Ladies in White The Ladies in White from Cuba were one of the three Laureates of the Sakharov Prize in 2005. With the award, the European Parliament recognised their courage and commitment to the cause of human rights in Cuba and drew attention to the continuing detention of the 75 political dissidents imprisoned since March 2003, most for simply criticising the lack of political freedom in the country. In Cuba, speaking out against the government is a subversive act punished by up to 25 years in prison. Any attempt to consign the prisoners to oblivion failed thanks to their wives, mothers and daughters who brought international attention to their situation through their peaceful protests. They call themselves the Ladies in White (Damas de Blanco) and were formed as a spontaneous movement in early 2004. They are not a political party or bound to a political organisation of any type. By wearing white to symbolise innocence and purity they reflect the tactic used by mothers in 1970s Argentina to demand information about their missing children. These women, Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo, won the Sakharov Prize in 1992. Every Sunday, the Ladies in White attend religious services in the Church of Santa Rita, after which they peacefully walk down Havana\u2019s Fifth Avenue, flowers in hand, calling for the liberation of their loved ones and for all those arbitrarily incarcerated on the island. Initially, they started writing letters to the Cuban authorities but they did not get a single reply. When their protest started, it was the first time in 47 years that women in Cuba had gone out into the streets to protest against unjust imprisonment. Despite having been threatened and insulted, the Ladies in White continue to stand up for the rights of Cuban political prisoners and the dignity of all Cuban people. Their demand for justice and their call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners is carried forward by a peaceful struggle. They are united in their anguish in the face of the 21 ",
        "appalling conditions their loved ones are suffering as prisoners. The Ladies in White have called for solidarity amongst all peoples for their cause. Five women: Laura Poll\u00e1n, Miriam Leiva, Berta Soler, Loyda Vald\u00e9s and Julia N\u00fanez, were selected by the group to receive the Prize on behalf of the Ladies in White at the ceremony of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The Cuban authorities did not authorise the representatives to leave the country to receive the Prize in Strasbourg. They were represented instead by Blanca Reyes, one of their activists currently living in Spain. Meantime, Laura Poll\u00e1n, one of the founders and chosen representatives of the Ladies in White, died in October 2011. The Ladies in White were not given authorisation to attend the conference celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Sakharov Prize in November 2011 either. To date, the Sakharov Prize has not been handed to the Ladies in White. The European Parliament continues to insist on their right to receive the Prize in person. 2005 Hauwa Ibrahim Hauwa Ibrahim is a human rights lawyer from Abuja, Nigeria, and a mother of two sons. She was born in 1968 in a small, poor village, the daughter of a mullah. A career as a lawyer was not supposed to figure in her destiny. What she was supposed to do was get married at the age of 12 and end her studies at primary school level. She refused this destiny. As one of only a few women lawyers practising in northern Nigeria, her work took her into the rural hinterland, where she had to travel by camel or donkey to get to the villages. She describes this time as among the best of her life, because she was able to relate to the grassroots that she came from. She is acutely aware of the importance of education in the empowerment of women and as a defence for those facing the greatest deprivation. Poverty and illiteracy go hand in hand \u2013 and fundamentalism feeds on ignorance. Hauwa Ibrahim, who was brought up as a Muslim herself, works tirelessly to fight against religious fundamentalism. Hauwa Ibrahim has built up what can only be described as an extraordinary practice: defending people who are condemned under Islamic Sharia law which is applied in 12 northern states of Nigeria. Death sentences, although not carried out for the moment, continue to be handed down. Since 1999, Hauwa Ibrahim has worked free-of-charge as defence counsel in 47 cases, many of which have involved women accused of adultery and subjected to death by stoning. It was her ability to capture international public opinion that made it possible to save the lives of Amina Lawa, Safiya Hussaini and Hafsatu Abukabar. She was equally involved in fighting other cases of cruel and inhuman punishment, such as women sentenced to flogging or young boys sentenced to amputation for theft. Hauwa Ibrahim has become an iconic figure, but her charisma makes some uncomfortable. She is banned from pleading in Islamic courts. \u2018I do not comment on the Koran\u2019, she said. \u2018My only objective is to have the fundamental rights of each and every human being respected, like the rule of law and the right to a fair trial.\u2019 Hauwa argued successfully that Sharia law requires the Sharia courts to respect the procedural and substantive rights guaranteed by Sharia law as well as the Nigerian Constitution and that the international human rights treaties to which Nigeria is signatory must be observed. Hauwa\u2019s cause now resonates beyond Nigeria\u2019s borders. But for her the most difficult task is yet to be achieved, that of making her voice heard in her own country. At the 2011 Sakharov Network Conference, commenting on the award of the Prize to the Arab Spring, Hauwa Ibrahim said: \u2018for me the Arab spring is the future. Future for democracy, future for human rights and freedom and future for dignity of human beings...I think it\u2019s a huge recognition to a new world order. A new world order where it is no longer the space for a selected few. To have power and keep power forever.\u2019 2005 Reporters without Borders Reporters Without Borders campaigns for press freedom around the world, and defends and supports journalists and other media workers who are victims of persecution and censorship. According to Reporters Without Borders, more than a third of the world\u2019s population live in countries where they do not enjoy press freedom. In 2012, the Reporters Without Borders\u00b4 Press Freedom Barometer recorded 50 journalists killed, and 147 imprisoned whilst doing their job or for motives related to their profession. Reporters Without Borders has been fighting such practices for 20 years now. Reporters Without Borders constantly on the alert via its network of over 120 correspondents, 22 ",
        "23 rigorously condemns any attack on press freedom worldwide and keeps it in the public eye through the media and public awareness campaigns. Not only does it highlight the moral arguments against restrictions of press freedom, censorship and persecution of the press, it also offers practical assistance to journalists who work in war zones. In January 2002, when it created the Damocles Network, Reporters Without Borders acquired a judicial arm. In order to ensure that the murderers and torturers of journalists are brought to trial, the Network provides victims with legal services and represents them in court. The organisation\u2019s initiatives are being carried out on five continents through its national branches and regional offices, in close cooperation with local and regional press freedom organisations. Reporters Without Borders\u2019 multilingual website keeps a daily tally of attacks on press freedom worldwide and offers the opportunity of signing online petitions in support of imprisoned journalists. To circumvent censorship, it occasionally publishes articles which have been banned in their country of origin, hosts newspapers that have been closed down in their homeland and serves as a forum for journalists who have been \u201csilenced\u201d by the authorities of their country. On 10 December every year, the association awards the The Reporters Without Borders \u2013 Foundation of France Prize to journalists for their outstanding contribution to the cause of press freedom in their country. In 2010, the organisation launched its Netizen Prize, which recognizes an Internet user, blogger or cyber-dissident who has made a notable contribution to the defence of online freedom of expression. 2006 Aliaksandr Milinkevich Aliaksandr Milinkevich, born in 1947 in the city of Hrodna, has served as the leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus. He was chosen to be the joint presidential candidate of the United Democratic Opposition in October 2005, collecting more than 100 000 supporting signatures, and he was able to keep the Belarusian opposition together to form a common front against Aliaksandr Lukashenka throughout the campaign for the presidential elections of 19 March 2006. Aliaksandr Milinkevich called for a truly democratic future for Belarus and presented himself as a real alternative to the authoritarianism of Lukashenka. His diplomatic approach to negotiation and cautious public appearances helped him to build firm international support for his struggle. The results of the elections were assessed by the European Union as neither free nor fair, and furthermore, subject to fraud. Aliaksandr Milinkevich officially received 6% of the votes, but unofficial reports state that his popular support was much higher. The human rights situation in Belarus has deteriorated since the elections of March 2006. The authorities have enacted a law criminalizing behaviour deemed critical to the state. The silencing and imprisonment of journalists, activists, and other critics found to be politically inconvenient by the current regime still continues. In April 2006, Milinkevich was himself imprisoned for 15 days, together with other opposition members, for taking part in an \u201cunsanctioned rally,\u201d a peaceful demonstration in Minsk, to mark the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. In an increasingly hostile political environment Aliaksandr Milinkevich has been arrested several times in recent years but no charges were filed against him. Aliaksandr Milinkevich is committed to continuing his fight for a democratic future in his country, and for the return of fundamental rights to the Belarusian people, despite a difficult political climate. In September 2010, he announced his decision not to stand as a candidate in the Presidential elections of 19 December 2010 as he considered that no changes had been made to national electoral regulations to ensure fair, free and open elections in Belarus. 2007 Salih Mahmoud Mohamed Osman Salih Osman is a lawyer working with the Sudan Organisation against Torture (SOAT) to provide free legal representation to people who have been arbitrarily detained and tortured by the Sudanese government and whose only crime is that they oppose government policies or share the same ethnicity as the rebel movements in Darfur. Over two decades, during Sudan\u2019s various civil wars, Osman has risked his own life ",
        "24 to provide legal and medical aid to the victims of the conflict. He fights court cases on behalf of those charged by the Sudanese government, and has been successful with SOAT in overturning or reducing sentences of death or amputation. Salih Osman and SOAT have also been active in cataloguing crimes that have taken place \u2013 particularly in the Darfur region \u2013 and they are engaged in a campaign to have rape prosecuted as a war crime. He is also actively involved in the protection of over 2 million Sudanese who have been forced to abandon their homes. Salih Osman\u2019s fight against injustice in Sudan has come at a personal cost. Members of his own family have suffered at the hands of the militias. He himself was persecuted for his actions, detained several times, held incommunicado and tortured. Since 2006, Salih Osman has served as an opposition member of the Sudanese Parliament. He works on legal reform and focuses on promoting the rule of law through the implementation of the provisions of the interim constitution. 2008 Hu Jia Hu Jia, born in 1973 in Beijing, is a prominent Chinese human rights activist and dissident. His work has focused on calls for an official inquiry into the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and HIV/AIDS advocacy and as well as raising environmental concerns. In 2008, after addressing Members of the European Parliament via a conference call during a public meeting of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and expressing his desire that 2008 be the \u2018year of human rights in China\u2019, he was arrested and charged with \u2018inciting subversion of state power.\u2019 He was found guilty and sentenced on 3 April 2008 to three-and-a-half years in jail. He was released in June 2011, but continues to suffer persecution as security agents stationed outside his home would not allow him even to go and buy food, and his internet connection was interrupted shortly after his wife Zeng Jinyan left China for Hong Kong in September 2012. Even in these tough conditions, Hu Jia continues to be an outspoken dissident and an advocate for change in China. 2009 Memorial Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva on behalf of Memorial and all other human rights defenders in Russia were awarded the Prize in 2009. Memorial is a Russian NGO which, since its foundation in 1988, has documented, monitored and strived to promote the truth about violations of human rights in Russia and other former states of the USSR, in order to ensure their democratic future. Memorial has set up a database of over 1 300 000 names of persecuted people, with the aim of building a publicly available archive of historical documentation of the consequences of totalitarian repression. Conducting research and protecting refugees and victims of discrimination and political repression, Memorial has contributed to the adoption of the Law on Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression and in making October 30 a Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Political Repression in the countries of the former USSR. On 4 December 2008 the Russian authorities confiscated twelve hard discs containing the entire digital archive of 20 years\u2019 work on the crimes committed under Stalin. On 15 July 2009 Natalia Estemirova, Memorial representative in Grozny investigating murders and abductions in Chechnya, was abducted and later assassinated. Only weeks later, on 10 August 2009, human rights defenders Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband, working closely with Memorial, were killed in the same tragic circumstances. The Sakharov Prize was awarded in 2009 to three people on behalf of Memorial and Russia\u2019s numerous human rights defenders: Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva. Oleg Orlov, a life long human rights defender and the head of the Council of Memorial, was found guilty in a civil defamation suit in October 2009, having accused Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov of being responsible for Natalia Estemirova\u2019s death. On 31 January 2010, Orlov and some 100 others were arrested in Moscow during a peaceful demonstration on Triumphalnaya Square. In September 2010, Parliament expressed concern about Orlov\u2019s ongoing trial for criminal charges of libel. ",
        "Sergei Kovalev, co-founder of Memorial, is the current chair of the Russian Memorial and founded the first Soviet human rights association, the Initiative Group for the defence of Human Rights in the USSR in 1969. Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the head and co-founder of the Moscow Helsinki Group, is renowned for campaigning for fair trials of arrested dissidents and for their objective coverage in the media. Since August 31, 2009, Lyudmila Alexeyeva has been an active participant in Strategy-31 \u2013 the protest rallies of citizens on Moscow\u2019s Triumphalnaya Square in defence of the 31st Article (on the Freedom of Assembly) of the Russian Constitution. She was detained during one of these protests, prompting Jerzy Buzek, then President of the European Parliament to appeal for the release of the then 82-year-old Alexeyeva and other Russian human rights activists. 2010 Guillermo Fari\u00f1as A doctor of psychology, independent journalist and political dissident in Cuba, Guillermo Fari\u00f1as has over the years conducted over 20 hunger strikes to protest against the Cuban regime, with the aim of achieving peaceful political change, freedom of speech and freedom of expression in his country. As a journalist, he founded the independent press agency \u2013 Cubanac\u00e1n Press \u2013 with the aim of informing the rest of the world of the destiny of political prisoners in Cuba. Eventually, he was forced by the authorities to close his press agency. Committed to non-violence and daring to denounce the Cuban regime, Fari\u00f1as has become one of the most well-known dissidents in his country. His bravery was rewarded with a \u201cReporters Without Borders\u201d Cyber-freedom Prize in 2006. On 8 July 2010 Fari\u00f1as ended a hunger strike after the Cuban government announced it was in the process of freeing 52 political prisoners. By then, Fari\u00f1as, who was calling for the liberation of political prisoners who had taken ill after many years of imprisonment, had been refusing food and liquids for more than 130 days. He had begun his strike in February 2010 after the controversial death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a prisoner of conscience, who died after 82 days of hunger strike. The European Parliament has repeatedly voiced solidarity with the entire Cuban people and affirmed its support for progress towards democracy, respect and promotion of fundamental freedoms. In October 2010, Jerzy Buzek, then President of the European Parliament stated that Fari\u00f1as\u2019 protest carries the hopes for all of those who care for freedom, human rights and democracy, and called for the immediate release of all political prisoners. Guillermo Fari\u00f1as could not participate in the 2010 Sakharov Prize award ceremony in Strasbourg because he was not allowed to leave Cuba. In July 2012, he was arrested at the funeral of another Sakharov Prize Laureate and Cuban dissident, Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, and later released. 2011 Mohamed Bouazizi Mohamed Bouazizi was a symbol for Tunisians fighting for democracy and freedom. He died on 4th January 2011 after setting himself on fire in protest at a system that kept him from making a decent living to support his family. He was only 26 years old. His desperate act inspired the revolt and his name became a rallying call as Tunisians rose to end President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\u2019s 23-year-rule in Tunisia. This was the first revolution of the Arab Spring. 2011 Ali Ferzat Ali Ferzat is a renowned Syrian political satirist, born in 1941, who has published more than 15,000 cartoons in Syrian and international newspapers. As Syrians began to protest the regime of Bashar al- Assad, his cartoons were waved in the streets. His criticism led to his being badly beaten by masked men in public in Damascus, and left on the streets as dead. Both his hands were broken, in what the masked men called a warning to him against dishonouring his masters. Ali Ferzat not only recovered the use of his hands, but broke the barrier of fear to become one of the regime\u2019s most outspoken critics through his words and his art. Unable to attend the Sakharov Prize ceremony in 2011 as he underwent treatment in Kuwait for his injuries, he received the award at the Sakharov Prize Network annual public event held at the European Parliament in October 2012, where he also debated the revolution in Syria and the future of democracy following the Arab awakenings. 25 ",
        "2011 Asmaa Mahfouz Asmaa Mahfouz is an Egyptian activist born in 1985 who braved the Mubarak regime\u2019s crackdown on online activists to post a call on various social media outlets on the internet for Egyptians to claim their freedom, dignity and human rights by protesting peacefully in Tahrir Square on 25th January 2011. The video went viral and inspired a wave of similar videos, resulting in hundreds of thousands occupying Tahrir Square clamouring for Hosni Mubarak to end his 30-year rule of Egypt, which he did on 11th February 2012. In 2008, Asmaa Mahfouz was one of the co-founders of the Egyptian April 6 youth movement, an organization responsible for coordinating nation-wide efforts in support of striking textile workers aiming to advance their demands for fair wages, medical care, access to transportation and education. She continues to be actively engaged in civil and youth movements working for the transformation of existing institutions and for the demands of the revolution to be realized. She was a main speaker at the Sakharov Prize Network annual public event held in Brussels at the European Parliament, in October 2012, debating the post-revolution evolution of the situation in Egypt and the future of democracy in Arab countries following the Arab Spring. She was a main speaker at the Sakharov Prize Network annual public event held in Brussels at the European Parliament, in October 2012, debating the post-revolution evolution of the situation in Egypt and the future of democracy in Arab countries following the Arab Spring. 2011 Ahmed El Zuber El Senussi Ahmed El Senussi, born in 1934, is Libya\u2019s longest-serving \u201cprisoner of conscience.\u201d He was accused of conspiracy in an attempted coup against the Gaddafi regime in 1970 and spent 31 years in prison. He was released in August 2010, alongside dozens of other political prisoners. As a member of the National Transitional Council set up in 2011 as the Libyan revolution toppled the Gaddafi regime, he was in charge of political prisoners. He now continues his courageous work to improve human rights and the rule of law in Libya and considers the Sakharov Prize he received to be an award to the Libyan people. He was a main speaker at the Sakharov Prize Network annual public event held in Brussels at the European Parliament, in October 2012, debating the aftermath of the revolution and armed conflict in Libya and the future of democracy in Arab countries following the Arab Spring. 2011 Razan Zaitouneh Razan Zaitouneh is a Syrian journalist and human rights lawyer who, a year after being awarded the Sakharov Prize, was still in hiding after the Syrian police arrested her husband and her brother-in-law and Syrian state television defamed her as a foreign agent. In spite of the repression, she continued to speak out for human rights in her country and gathering information about the atrocities being committed in Syria through a network of political activists and human rights defenders, to tell the world about them through the foreign media. Born in 1977, Razan Zaitouneh started to practise law in 2001, and in that same year became a defence lawyer for political prisoners and co-founded the Human Rights Association in Syria. In 2005, she set up the Syrian Human Rights Information Link and became an active member of the Committee to Support Families of Political Prisoners in Syria. In 2011, she was also awarded the Anna Politkovskaya Award by Reach All Women in WAR, which accords recognition to women defending human rights in warzones. She refuses to leave Syria until the fighting in the country is over. 26 ",
