        "1 Executive summary The political backdrop of this analysis is provided by the Committee of the Regions (CoR) proposal of a Code of conduct for the involvement of the local and regional authorities in the European Semester 1 and by the territorial analyses of the 2017 Country Reports and 2016 Country-specific Recommendations (CSR). It is important to note that the following analysis describes how the National Reform Programme (NRP) reports on the role and involvement of the Local and Regional Authorities (LRAs) \u2013 it cannot assess the actual involvement of the LRAs in its preparation and implementation. The analysis followed a comparative approach between the current situation and the preceding years (from 2011 onwards). The Report sets out to what extent the involvement of LRAs has improved or worsened. The NRP as a policy document is the result of an inter-administrative coordination process and a subsequent political consultation. A major point is evident: political administrative systems do not change quickly - these systems rather evolve than change all of a sudden. Given this \u2018inertia\u2019 of the systems, one can expect that major findings in many analytical dimensions do not change or vary over time. The three key steps in the methodological approach have been: \uf06e Thorough analysis of the NRPs in a structured manner; \uf06e Calibrating and harmonising the results, in particular the evaluation (i.e. the scoring) on the quality of information; \uf06e Summarising and illustrating the key findings. The review in 2017 has focused on five key elements : \uf06e An assessment of the extent in which the NRP shows regional disparities, differentiated impacts, and specific policies across regional and local territories; \uf06e The involvement of LRAs in the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the NRP in all the policy fields; \uf06e Obstacles to Investments \u2013 an assessment on how and in which extent the NRP includes the support in investment in order to safeguard quality of life for citizens and to create jobs; 1 Adopted by the CoR Plenary on 11 May 2017.

        "2 \uf06e References to institutional capacities and dedicated actions for capacity building; \uf06e Partnership and Multi-Level Governance \u2013 an assessment of whether these principles affect the design and implementation of the NRPs and EU 2020. To give a first indication of the scale of LRA involvement in the NRPs, the following map shows the total score per NRP according to the evaluation grid described in the \u201cMethodology\u201d section. Figure 1. Map illustrating the scale of LRA involvement in the EU 27 ",
        "3 The map reveals a marked diversity. On the one hand, a considerably strong involvement of LRAs is shown by some Northern and Central European EU15- countries with strong traditions of regional self-government. Among these are the three genuine federations within the EU (AT, BE, DE) as well as NL and SE. On the other hand, some peripheral countries show strong involvement of LRAs in their NRPs \u2013 IT and ES (EU-15) on the Mediterranean side and LV (EU-13) on the side of the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). Territorial dimension The majority of NRPs does reflect a territorial dimension although the rationale and approach differ quite strongly. 18 programmes do include at least one or more elements which can be considered as specific policy approach for certain regions. Scores are distributed relatively evenly between 3 and the maximum of 6, only with one exception (IE). LRA involvement in the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the NRP The Northern and Western European countries, as well as the Mediterranean (EU-15), show a strong involvement of LRAs in the preparation process of the NRP reports. Several NRPs explicitly mention the involvement of actors at all levels of administration as well as social partners and civil society in the preparation process. The major part of the NRP mentions LRA involvement, for instance, as a consultation process or bilateral exchange with the Government \u2013 or more specifically in the form of a Contact Committee. However, nine countries do not mention the inclusion of LRAs in the process, eight of them being CEEC with their strongly centralised political-administrative systems (the ninth being LU). When it comes to the role of LRAs in the implementation of policies related to the NRP the aftermath of the economic crisis leaves its mark on the issues where LRA responsibilities are explicitly involved: the prevalent topic of the NRPs, which is highly recurrent, is social inclusion. It is by far the issue most often cited in connection with the involvement of LRAs. The topic has a clear territorial dimension since it concerns primarily regions with high unemployment, often threatened by a \u201cvicious circle\u201d of shrinking or ageing population, rising social expenses, infrastructural deficits and diminishing economic base. Other topics, for example health care, recorded in previous NRPs tend to be less prominent this year. Topics where the involvement of LRAs is explicit are employment initiatives, education programmes and improvements of the business environment. The large refugee flows since summer 2015 leave a mark in the NRPs of some of the most affected countries (BE, DE, EE, FI, LU, SE). ",
        "4 Nine countries make explicit reference to evaluation procedures of previous NRPs including the role of LRAs. Eight NRPs contain minor or general references; ten do not mention approaches to monitoring and evaluation at all, among them seven CEEC and two Mediterranean countries (BG, CZ, EE, ES, HR, HU, LU, PT, SI, SK). The general picture broadly fits the findings of the Territorial Analysis of the Country Reports (CRs) done by the European Committee of the Regions (CoR). The Territorial Analysis also highlights social policies, health care, housing and pensions as one of the most frequent territorial challenges mentioned in the CRs. Education, training and RTDI rank second in terms of frequency \u2013 a point which is not mirrored exactly in the analysis of NRPs \u2013 in particular when it comes to RTDI. Public administration ranks third in the Territorial Analysis of CRs. Obstacles to Investment Obstacles to Investment can be considered as one of the key points of the NRP: CSRs and therefore many policy elements in response to the CSRs refer implicitly or explicitly to obstacles for investment. A territorial perspective on the issue is only found in a small number of NRPs (6 out of 27). Rather concrete references to the governance issue, i.e. the framework for investment at LRA level, are found in 11 cases \u2013 ranging from the fiscal equalisation systems such as in AT and DE or the reform of local level funding (ES) to the role of ESIF policies for the local level. This is also reflected in related policy areas where taxation plays a major role. A second relatively frequent issue is housing policy which - next to its social dimension \u2013 is also crucial for the mobility of labour force. Institutional (administrative) capacity As a general feature, countries with ongoing or recently implemented administrative reforms (BE, CY, DE, ES, FI, LV; to a lesser extent PT) show a tendency for a more intense coverage of LRA involvement than comparable countries without such reform programmes. The role of administrative capacity- building is addressed specifically in this year\u2019s NRP analysis: in ten NRPs the intended approach to capacity-building includes a reference to LRAs (2016: 12). The topics cover a broad and inhomogeneous field ranging from support in the implementation of investment policies to anti-fraud measures. In 12 cases general references are included. In many cases the approaches to policy fields with an increasing role of LRAs would indicate the need for capacity-building, but it is rarely explicit. One major incentive to explicitly report on the issue has been low absorption capacities in SF and ESIF in the previous periods. In such ",
        "5 cases the EC has pinpointed the need for capacity building in many of the regular review processes in Cohesion Policy. Partnership and Multi-Level-Governance The dimension Partnership and Multi-Level-Governance (MLG) has low variations and score reasonably high thus indicating an acknowledgement of the crucial role of LRA in the implementation of the NRPs and Europe 2020 targets. References to coordination among the different tiers of administration can be found in more than half of the NRPs (15). Among these, the EU-15 Member States (MS) play a major role but also PL, whereas the NRPs of EU-13 MS with rather centralised political systems include only minor or no reference to inter- administrative coordination issues at all. Among multi-level or partnership- based cooperation models education is an important topic. ",
        "",
        "7 1 Introduction In the context of the European Semester the EU Member States (MS) had to deliver their National Reform Programmes (NRP) by mid-April 2017 2 . The programmes are based on the priorities defined by the European Commission (EC) in the Annual Growth Survey. The Commission says about the NRPs: All Member States have committed to the Europe 2020 strategy. However, each country has different economic circumstances and translates the overall EU objectives into national targets in its National Reform Programme \u2013 a document which presents the country's policies and measures to sustain growth and jobs and to reach the Europe 2020 targets. The National Reform Programme is presented in parallel with its Stability/Convergence Programme, which sets out the country's budgetary plans for the coming three or four years. The NRP is a document designed and elaborated by the administration at national level. It is primarily meant to give an aggregate picture on major reform processes. Thus the level of detail of NRPs on e.g. the territorial dimension of challenges is limited and will remain so. But still in most policy fields several or all tiers of government have to interact in a coordinated way in order to efficiently and effectively implement the respective measures. Among others, the impact of policies is always a local one in the end \u2013 for example: investment in high-grade infrastructure, which tends to strengthen cities as network nodes or hubs, or social inclusion policies, which might become decisive for the economic future of disfavoured urban areas. In most cases the effectiveness of policy measures is dependent on the effectiveness of coordination between the government levels. This fact should also be reflected in the NRP. The NRP is intended to report on policy issues which in many cases represent long-term challenges: measures in structural policies (such as labour market, education policies or shortfalls in infrastructure networks as obstacle to investment) will not have immediate impact but rather come into effect in the mid-term. This is also reflected in the results of this analysis which is done on an annual basis. In many regards the results are quite constant over the years \u2013 reflecting the long-term character of structural changes; the dynamic in the focus of the NRPs is owed significantly to the responsiveness of MS to the CSRs. NRPs should follow a multi-level governance (MLG) approach which means being designed and implemented by all tiers of government in partnership. It is 2 European Commission. Website Europe 2020. https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/european-semester_en ",
        "8 evident that annual reporting as requested in the frame of the European Semester might tend to become administrative routine thus favouring a pragmatic approach. In order to counteract such tendencies the role of third parties observing the process and monitoring the contents of NRPs is useful. The political background of this analysis is provided by the CoR proposal of a Code of conduct for the involvement of the local and regional authorities in the European Semester 3 and by the territorial analyses of the 2017 Country Reports (CR) and 2016 Country-specific Recommendations (CSR) 4 . The Code as well as the territorial analysis strongly advocate for a more thorough consideration of the role of LRAs in all policy processes, which are interlinked with the European Semester. This analysis seeks to contribute to raise awareness in this sense. The following sections of the report include an analysis of the 27 NRPs published in 2017 and if necessary their annexed or secondary documents. The review has focused on five key points : \uf06e An assessment of the extent in which the NRP shows regional disparities, differentiated impacts, and specific policies across regional and local territories. \uf06e The involvement of LRAs in the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the NRP in all the policy fields; it is evident that in particular direct involvement in the preparation would represent a major lever to shape the contents of the document. \uf06e Obstacles to Investments \u2013 an assessment on how and in which extent the NRP includes the support in investment in order to safeguard quality of life for citizens and to create jobs. \uf06e References to institutional capacities and dedicated actions for capacity building. \uf06e Partnership and Multi-Level Governance \u2013 an assessment of whether these principles affect the design and implementation of the NRPs and EU 2020. As a cross-cutting feature the Report also highlights examples of good practices in all aspects. 3 Adopted by the CoR Plenary on 11 May 2017 4 http://portal.cor.europa.eu/europe2020/Pages/welcome.aspx ",
        "9 2 Methodology As far as possible the analysis followed a comparative approach of the current situation and the preceding years (from 2011 onwards). The Report sets out in which extent the involvement of LRAs in the NRP process has improved or worsened. The three key steps in the methodological approach have been: \uf06e Thorough analysis of the NRPs in a structured manner; the result of the analysis is summarised in the so-called Country Fiches providing a brief outline of the findings structured according to the pre-defined questions; the task was carried out by a group of country experts. \uf06e Calibrating and harmonising the results, in particular the evaluation (i.e. the scoring) of the quality of information. \uf06e Summarising the key findings. Review of the NRPs against the EC Guidance The EC has developed a concise guidance for the NRPs where the major expectations concerning the NRPs are shown: 5 \uf06e The main focus is on the implementation of the country-specific recommendations (CSR); \uf06e The implementation of Europe 2020 is the complementary focus in order to provide the EC with recent information on developments in those policy fields which are crucial to attain the goals of EU 2020. According to the EC guidance, a specific section should be dedicated to institutional issues and the involvement of stakeholders; a specific reference to the involvement of the LRAs in the preparation and implementation of the NRP is explicitly requested. In general NRPs should be closely and consistently interlinked with the Stability and Growth / Convergence Programmes (SGP / SCP). Thus in case of a lack of 5 European Commission, Guidance on the content and format of the National Reform Programmes, October 2013, Brussels, p. 5. ",
        "10 crucial information also these programmes have been consulted. However, research in secondary documents had to be kept to a minimum. Analysing the territorial dimension A major interest is the analysis of the NRPs regarding the territorial dimension: i.e. in which extent the NRPs address territorial disparities taking the situation at sub-national level into account. This relates mainly to: \uf06e The territorial dimension in key sectoral policies presented in the NRPs; \uf06e The challenge of improving the administrative capacity of the local and regional authorities. The analysis of the territory-related challenges has been aligned with the analysis of territory-related challenges in the European Semester and of territory-related Country-Specific Recommendations based on the Country Reports for 2017. Operational guidelines for the analysis of the 2017 NRP The template of a Country Fiche (annexed to the Report) is the model to rank the quality of information provided in the NRP according to a simple and straightforward classification divided into three stages. The following table outlines our understanding of the dimensions of the analysis and the key evaluation questions to be answered. Table 1.

The Country Fiches follow the structure of the Table 2 above concerning dimensions and key evaluation questions. Evaluation of the quality of information In order to provide overviews and a comparative analysis it was necessary to introduce a classification on the quality of the information provided in the NRP.

        "15 3 Summary report on findings The following section includes a general assessment of all 2017 NRPs and a comparative analysis with NRPs from previous years. For the report on the NRPs 2017 the methodology has been slightly changed. An additional section is dealing with institutional capacity. The administrative capacity in general \u2013 but in particular the capacity at sub-national level \u2013 is a pre-requisite for efficient and effective approaches in all policy fields. The NRP as a policy document is the result of an inter-administrative coordination process and a subsequent political consultation. A major point is evident: political administrative systems do not change quickly \u2013 these systems rather evolve than change all of a sudden. This is reasonable since the public sector is in charge of tasks which for example require long-term stability in terms of delivery and maintenance (e.g. education, water supply), tasks which serve social purposes or tasks where competition makes limited sense (e.g. in case of most infrastructure networks). The major part of state budgets is dedicated to long-term liabilities; the room for manoeuvre, i.e. unprecedented and new tasks is clearly limited. Given this \u2018inertia\u2019 of the systems, one can expect that major findings in many analytical dimensions do not change or vary over time. The more detailed results according to the key evaluation questions can be found in Annex 2. 3.1 Total scores of LRA involvement in the NRP To give a first indication of the scale of LRA involvement in the NRPs, the following Table 4 shows a map with a total of all scorings per NRP according to the evaluation grid described above in Chapter 2 on Methodology. The following analysis describes how the NRP reports on the role and involvement of the LRAs \u2013 it does not assess the actual involvement of the LRAs in its preparation and implementation. ",
        "16 Figure 2. Map illustrating the scale of LRA involvement in the EU 27 The map reveals a marked diversity. On the one hand, a considerably strong involvement of LRAs is shown by some Northern and Central European EU15- countries with strong traditions of regional self-government, among these are the three genuine federations within the EU (AT, BE, DE) as well as NL and SE. This mirrors the results of the 2016 study indicating an unchanged role of LRAs in the political structures of these countries. On the other hand, some peripheral countries show strong involvement of LRAs in their NRPs \u2013 IT and ES (EU-15) on the Mediterranean side and LV (EU-13) on the side of the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). High scorings of peripheral countries have also been noted in the 2016 study; however most of the MS concerned have changed. Only LV had already shown ",
        "17 similar high scorings in 2015 by carrying out a local government reform in 2009 7 . The results seem to indicate that, with a few exceptions, LRA involvement in Mediterranean and CEE MS is not anchored as deeply in the political processes as in the first group of MS resulting in fluctuations caused by contingencies changing every year. As last year, on the average the overall scorings are slightly lower than for the previous year (2017: 1.32 mean per country per question, 2016: 1.34, 2015: 1.42). Taking into account a certain inevitable room for interpretation inherent to the underlying comparative approach, this has not necessarily be interpreted as a sign of stagnation. Based on the detailed scores the following patterns can be observed: \uf06e The Northern and Central European countries as well as the Mediterranean show a strong involvement of LRAs in the preparation process of the NRP reports. Several NRPs explicitly mention the involvement of actors at all levels of administration as well as social partners and civil society in the preparation process. The major part of the NRPs mentions LRA involvement as a consultation process or bilateral exchange with the Government, or more specific like in the form of a Contact Committee. However, nine countries do not mention the inclusion of LRAs in the process, eight of them being CEEC with their strongly centralised political-administrative systems (the ninth being LU). \uf06e The majority of NRPs does reflect a territorial dimension although the rationale and approach differs quite strongly. 18 programmes do include at least one or more elements which can be considered as specific policy approach for certain regions. Scores are relatively evenly distributed between 3 and the maximum of 6 with one exception (IE). \uf06e A high variability of scores can be observed within the dimensions Obstacles to Investment and Administrative Capacity . These are rather specific evaluation criteria opening a broad range of scores in the individual NRPs. Scores range from 0 up to 6 (which is the maximum for both dimensions). In six cases, specific reference was made to the territorial perspective on Obstacle to investments, partly by EU-15 countries with a long tradition of regional self-governance (AT, BE, UK), partly by EU-13 countries (RO, SI, SK). It should be mentioned that more 7 Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR), Decentralisation at a crossroads - Territorial reforms in Europe in times of crisis, Brussels, October 2013, p. 40 and 50. ",
        "18 NRPs mention specific policies targeted at Obstacle to investment than last year, mirroring the new policy focus. \uf06e The dimension partnership and MLG have low variations and reasonably high scores thus indicating an acknowledgement of the crucial role of LRA in the implementation of the NRPs and Europe 2020 targets. \uf06e Old MS tend to involve LRAs in the NRPs stronger than new MS; exceptions do exist \u2013 which can be traced back to detailed descriptions in the NRP reports, this year in the Report of LV. \uf06e The large refugee flows since summer 2015 leave a mark in the NRPs of some of the most affected countries (BE, DE, EE, FI, LU, SE). \uf06e Countries with ongoing or recently implemented administrative reforms (BE, CY, DE, ES, FI, LV; to a lesser extent PT) show a tendency to a more intense coverage of LRA involvement than comparable countries without such reform programmes. From a methodological point of view, it must be added that in the assessment process undertaken by different country experts it cannot be excluded \u2013 despite the common methodology and several rounds of validation \u2013 that some interpretations were slightly different from others. For more insights in the detailed assessment per country, the country fiches that can be found in a separate file shall be consulted. 3.2 Territorial dimension Generally speaking, it is important to note that the NRP is not meant as a policy document which is specifically focussing on a territorial dimension. Policy actors at national level do have the key role in drafting the document and the perspective is mostly on overarching policy approaches and corresponding challenges. Despite its implicit and explicit focus on a concise and aggregate view, the majority of NRPs does reflect a territorial dimension though the rationale and approach differs quite strongly. ",
        "19 Challenges and needs A visible group of MS (16) outlines specific disparities, needs or challenges for types of regions or even specific regions in the NRP (2016: 12). The main challenges addressed in the NRP range from: \uf06e Digital infrastructure/e-commerce/ICT skills (7); \uf06e Education (6); \uf06e Natural resources/natural disasters (5); \uf06e Employment (4); \uf06e Transport (4); \uf06e Social inclusion/poverty risk (4). For example the NRP of CZ highlights regional disparities i.e. the mismatch between demand and supply on regional labour markets. A further challenge in CZ is securing the flood prone areas which is an obvious territorial challenge in particular when it comes to agglomeration areas. DK mentions housing prices in larger cities and regional distribution of RTDI and higher education. LV points out the need for improving the accessibility of Information and Communication Technology (ICT; in this case broad band access) in rural regions as well as territorial disparities in early school leaving and regarding employment rate at the regional level. In RO, the Danube Delta faces a dual challenge: the conservation of its ecological assets and improvement of the quality of life for its residents. One NRP does not include any reference to disparities, needs and challenges from a territorial perspective. Ten NRPs make general or minor reference to the issue. Impact and coverage For about half the MS \u2013 14 in total - the NRPs include references to the impact of envisaged measures on specific territories (in total 7 in 2016). The local or regional effects of programs and measures can often be found in a table in the annex of the NRP. In other cases the NRP clearly separates between certain territories throughout the document. One programme does not relate to any specific territorial aspects of impact or coverage. ",
        "20 Specific policies The majority of the programmes (18) do include at least one or more elements which can be considered as specific policy approach for certain regions (2016: 21). The most frequent reference is to employment (10). Further common topics are regional/urban/rural development and spatial planning (9) as well as initiatives concerning transport issues (9), social inclusion (8) and energy (7). Examples include the Austrian EAFRD Programme 2014-2020 dealing with employment policy in rural areas. In CY, a successful project related to reduction and separate collection of municipal waste through recycling in hotels in certain coastal areas will be further expanded in 2017, with the collaboration of the local authorities. In FR, the set-up of the statute of metropolises and thus a new approach to governance of urban agglomeration areas is considered as one major pillar of administrative policy reforms which should have beneficial effects. IT has dedicated programmes targeting the Mezzogiorno (employment, RTDI) and regions hit by the earthquake (housing, infrastructure repair, prevention). In the case of seven programmes, the topic is dealt with in a rather general way or concerns minor topics. It is interesting to note that only two NRPs do not mention any specific policy with an explicit territorial dimension. 3.3 Involvement of LRAs in the NRP Preparation of the NRP A total of 15 NRPs provides specific references to the involvement of LRAs (2016: 13). The most detailed descriptions are provided in the programmes of DE, DK, FR, NL and SE; i.e. a group of EU-15 MS, mostly with a long tradition of regional self-governance. Three NRPs only provide a very general reference to the involvement of LRAs and in nine NRPs the role of the LRAs in the preparation of the document is not mentioned. Implementation of the NRP All NRPs include references although the level of information varies significantly. ",
        "21 The clear majority of MS (20) provides references to specific policy areas where LRAs do have a role in implementation (2016: 24). It is interesting to note that the most frequently mentioned policy fields are: \uf06e social inclusion (14); \uf06e budgetary, fiscal and administrative issues (13); \uf06e labour policy/employment (10); \uf06e economic policy, industrial policy, business development (8); \uf06e education (7). The top five policy fields have remained the same as in 2016 which is not surprising since all of the fields represent long-term structural challenges where rapid changes cannot be expected. These topics are all connected with the economic crisis and its main effect: unemployment with its social and budgetary consequences. The list of policy fields represents the key approaches to reduce unemployment, i.e. education and support to start-ups. An example would be LU where participation of LRAs is mentioned in the fields of development of the services sector, removal of obstacles in the retail and real estate sector and social housing. Another example is IE mentioning labour market activation policies, especially in relation to low-work intensity households, poverty risk of children, and affordable childcare. Seven documents include only quite general references. Evaluation of the NRP Nine countries make explicit reference to evaluation of previous NRPs highlighting the role of LRAs. Eight NRPs contain minor or general references; ten do not mention approaches to monitoring and evaluation at all, among them seven CEEC and two Mediterranean countries (BG, CZ, EE, ES, HR, HU, LU, PT, SI, SK). For example France \u2013 also in response to the CSR - is seeking to modernise its public services: part of the process consists in the evaluation of the quality of public spending. The process is ongoing since 2012. The spending reviews cover policies at all levels i.e. including the local level (collectivit\u00e9 territoriales). The territorial reform of urban agglomeration areas is understood as a major contribution in this sense. ",
        "22 EU 2020 The responses related to EU 2020 correlate more or less to those presented in the previous section, i.e. to the question on LRA involvement in preparation, implementation and evaluation of the NRP. The number of references to specific policy areas is 18 (2016: 18). The policy areas most frequently mentioned are: \uf06e social inclusion (13); \uf06e energy efficiency, climate and environmental measures (13); \uf06e labour/employment (11); \uf06e education (9); \uf06e RTDI (8). The top five topics have remained constant since 2016 but the ranks in frequency have changed among the policy fields; education has fallen behind from 1 st place in 2016 to 4 th place and energy efficiency and climate measures have risen from the 4 th to the 1 st place, together with social inclusion (2 nd in 2016). Three NRPs (DE, LU and SE) explicitly mention the integration of refugees in the aftermath of the crisis of 2015 (2016: DE and SE). A good example for the dominant focus on energy policy is IT where financing of about 100 MEUR from ERDF and Cohesion Funds is mentioned with 66 energy efficiency projects for public buildings of local authorities (municipal buildings, schools). Another example in the field of education is SE whose municipalities and county councils/regions organized about 90,000 holiday jobs for young people in 2016 who will start or study at high school. No reference to LRAs is made in five cases, only general reference in four cases. 3.4 Obstacle to Investment Territorial perspective In six cases, specific reference was made to the first dimension concerning the territorial perspective on Obstacles to Investments (2016: 7), partly by EU-15 countries with a long tradition of regional self-governance, partly by CEEC (AT, BE, RO, SI, SK, UK). ",
        "23 An example is SI where the construction of broadband infrastructure with public funds will be co-financed in rural areas where commercial interest is insufficient in order to trigger the investment. In the UK the following Obstacles to Investment with a strong involvement of LRAs are pinpointed in the NRP: shortfalls in infrastructure networks; shortage of housing supply; planning procedures; shortfalls in skills development and childcare. The issue was not covered at all in seven NRPs, 14 NRPs included only quite general references to the topic. Role of LRAs The rationale was to look for more concrete references to the role of LRAs in investment policies, particularly in actively removing Obstacle to Investment. In 11 cases quite specific references have been found (2016: 8): DE with its system of fiscal equalisation 8 is a well-known example. 9 NRPs only made general reference to the topic and seven did not address the issue at all. Related policies With a view to policies related to investment challenges, specific reference was made in 19 cases (2016: 15). A wide range of policy topics is covered, e.g. taxation (4), social housing (4) and financing of LRAs. In seven NRPs the role of ESIF is being highlighted as major public investment policy. Examples include LT with co-investment funds and so-called \u201cbusiness angel\u201d programmes providing capital for start-ups, both supported by ERDF. RO is also developing support services to stimulate entrepreneurship and creativity among SMEs. In ES, a reform of the financing system of Autonomous Communities (LRAs) shall safeguard investment in their main areas of competence: basic education, health and social services. In UK, the NRP concedes shortfalls in network infrastructure and refers to the priorities of the National Infrastructure Delivery Plan (NIDP) 2016-2021. The NIDP as guidance for infrastructure investment is explicitly intended to benefit LRAs by enabling economic growth and improving supply chains with other regions 9 . The Plan 10 covers a broad 8 So-called \u201cFinanzausgleich\u201d. 9 \u201cInfrastructure can be a powerful force in helping to unlock the economic potential of regions, supporting jobs and helping to rebalance the economy.\u201d Infrastructure and Projects Authority (UK), National Infrastructure Delivery Plan 2016\u20132021, London 2016, p. 81. 10 As of March 2016. ",
        "24 range of infrastructure: transport, energy, waste and water, coastal erosion, ICT, RDTI, housing supply, social and regional infrastructure. In six cases, general reference is made to the topic; two NRPs do not mention it. 3.5 Institutional Capacity Administrative capacities of LRAs related to NRP and Europe 2020 Nine NRPs refer to the topic in a specific way (2016: 20). For example CY sees the need for improving the administrative capacity of LRAs through a facilitated procedure of planning and building at a local level. SE reports challenges in dealing with the arrival of a large number of asylum seekers in 2015. In SK the LRAs need to be reformed to become more efficient. SK has more than 3.5 times more mayors and more than 2 times more local representatives per 100.000 inhabitants than the EU average. Partly the comparatively small units at local level are owed to the mountainous and rural character of the landscape. Consequently, many local key infrastructures lack economies of scale (e.g. water management or education) and the fragmented administrative system lacks efficiency in many areas and results in high expenditure on local self-administration. For seven NRPs there is no reference to the issue at all; in eleven cases the reference is general or covers minor topics. Administrative capacities of LRAs related to Obstacles to Investment In nine cases, specific reference is made to the topic. For example in HR, audit reports emphasise the need to strengthen the capacity in ESIF management and control systems, in particular considering the multiple increases in the amount of funds available from the ESIF available in the 2014- 2020 programming period. The reports state the need to employ approximately 700 people in 2017 in order to accelerate the absorption of funds. In NL, the Central Government provides more freedom to LRAs to decide how to use the regional budget. In BG, an analysis of regulatory regimes of municipalities was carried out in order to limit corruption and reduce the administrative burden on SMEs. Ten NRPs show general or minor references; in 8 cases no reference is made. ",
        "25 Institutional capacity building In ten NRPs the intended approach to capacity-building includes a reference to LRAs (2016: 12). The topics cover a broad and inhomogeneous field ranging from support in the implementation of investment policies to anti-fraud measures. For example, the Cyprus Academy of Public Administration (CAPA) that delivers training to communities and rural municipalities. In DE consulting is offered by a dedicated state company, \u201ePartnerschaft Deutschland \u2013 Berater der \u00f6ffentlichen Hand GmbH\u201c, for municipalities on planning and implementing investment projects. HU mentions voluntary corruption prevention and integrity management tasks of local governments: the institutions aim voluntarily to foster integrity management systems by publishing methodological guidelines and recommendations. Furthermore a training programme is being prepared for government and public administration officials on risk management system, too. SE provides government support to municipalities in the fields of integration of refugees, education, and future recruitment challenges of LRAs. In five programmes institutional capacity building is not addressed. A group of 12 programmes include general or minor references to the subject. 3.6 Partnership and Multi-Level Governance (MLG) Coordination among the tiers of administration In 15 cases specific reference is made (2016: 18 cases). In seven programmes the references are rather general and do not provide any hint on the actual weight of the issue. In FR, the national level and the regional councils have set-up a coordination platform in order to ensure joint efforts in employment policies. The platform also encourages partnerships and cross-sectoral coordination of actors. In accordance with the new Act on Territorial Organisation the national level can delegate the coordination of actors in employment policies to the regions. It can also encourage partnerships between the Employment Agency and the regions. In six NRPs the aspect of administrative coordination is not mentioned at all. ",
        "26 Cooperation models The question aims at reference to specific models of cooperation such as Territorial Pacts or other forms of cooperation. In 11 programmes the subject of cooperation and/or the approach to cooperation could be considered as models (2016: 15). The subject of cooperation varies among the MS. One example is the coordination platform Alliance Society 4.0 in CZ that was accepted by the Government in 2017 to ensure cooperation between all actors in the field of Society 4.0 (research on the effects of the 4th industrial revolution on economy and society). These actors are members of the public sector, economic and social partners, enterprises and academics. DK has a cluster strategy for bridging RTDI activities of regions, research institutions and companies. In NL, the Perspective Memorandum has been established to prepare for the future pension system in collaboration with stakeholders, social partners and senior citizens\u2019 organisations. In the UK, Local Enterprise Partnerships form cooperation between local authorities and businesses, which is going to be an increasing role in local infrastructure investment. Six out of the 26 NRPs do not include visible reference to cooperation models; ten provide rather general reference. Wider partnership The focus of interest is on social partners and the involvement of CSOs and NGOs with a clear-cut function in the implementation process. In 17 cases specific reference is made to the role of wider partnerships (2016: 23). A quite specific feature is the strong focus on the inclusion of the social partners in ten programmes (AT, BE, CY, DE, DK, HR, HU, LV, MT, NL). There is only one programme that does not refer to the inclusion of a wider partnership in policy development. In 9 cases the reference is rather general and does not allow drawing any conclusions on the subject or intensity of the consultation or participation process. 3.7 Comparative analysis This chapter comprises a summary and comparison on the role of LRAs in the Europe 2020 and NRPs. The objects of investigation have been the corresponding studies for the NRPs covering the years 2011 to 2016. The review of these reports is the fundament for the presentation of the main findings for the 2017 NRPs. Once again it is important to stress that all aspects in the ",
        "27 comparative analysis describe how the NRP reports on the role and involvement of the LRAs \u2013 it does not assess the actual involvement. In all NRPs, the extent to which LRA involvement and partnership and MLG is mentioned varies by Member State (MS). In all seven analyses of the National Reform Programmes concerning the involvement of the local and regional authorities in the European Semester between 2011 and 2017 11 , it is stressed that countries with a federal, decentralised government or devolved regional administrations usually provide fuller and more substantial information on LRAs and MLG than those with a centralised government. When looking back on the series of reports since 2011 one has to see that for the analysis of the NRPs 2015 12 the methodology had been fundamentally changed \u2013 i.e. the questions were modified and clustered under three key headings, i.e. firstly the involvement of the LRAs in the preparation and implementation of the NRP, secondly the role of Partnership and MLG in the NRP and finally the territorial dimension of the NRP. The latter aspect had been introduced for the first time in 2015. A second major point is that the approach of the assessment has been altered to a certain extent since 2015 \u2013 thus the assessment results are only partly comparable. For the 2016 report, an additional cluster on Obstacles to Investment has been introduced. The 2017 Report rearranged the clustering of criteria into five dimensions and added two new criteria (see above under Chapter 2 on Methodology). Table 3.

Territorial dimension Three new dimensions were evaluated in the 2015 NRPs that were not evaluated in previous years. These are territorial dimensions 1) reflecting on challenges and needs concerning certain LRAs or types of LRAs or territories, 2) the impact and coverage of policy measures on certain territories or LRAs and 3) specific policies targeting types of LRAs or territories. The first dimension concerning challenges and needs was covered by 54%/43% of the NRPs respectively in 2015 and 2016. Reference to the second dimension on impact and coverage in the 2015 and 2016 NRPs was made in respectively 36% and 25% of the cases. But in total 57% (2015) and 75% (2016) NRPs have included references to specific territorial policies targeting LRAs. In the 2017 report the first dimension concerning disparities, challenges and needs was covered by 59% of the NRPs (16) 14 . Reference to the second dimension on impact and coverage was 52% in the 2017 NRPs (14). 18 NRPs (67%) have included references to specific territorial policies. Direct references and involvement The NRPs from 2013 have the highest percentage of direct references to LRAs in the NRPs (96%) \u2013 for the NRPs 2014 the value has dropped to 71%. The 13 Included in the italics boxes. 14 For 2017, the sample only consists of 27 NRPs, without EL. ",
        "29 extent to which the LRAs are mentioned varies. In 2013, NRPs from Germany, Sweden and the UK contain the most extensive coverage of LRAs; in 2014 this was the case for the NRPs from Austria, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and the UK. In 2015 and 2016, 28 NRPs (100%) provide direct references to LRAs. In 2017, 27 NRPs (100%) provide direct references to LRAs. The descriptions on the role of LRAs in the preparation of the NRP show a stable position over the years \u2013 starting from 17 NRPs (63%) in 2011 to 15 NRPs (54%) in 2015 and 13 (46%) in 2016. In 2017, 15 NRPs (56%) include such references. In the 2011 report, 100% of the NRPs mention the role of LRAs in implementing the activities described in their NRPs. In 2013, 93% of NRPs mentioned LRAs role while for the NRPs 2014 the percentage decreased to 86%. For the 2015 NRPs the general result pointed at 23 or 82% of NRPs, for 2016: 24 or 86% of NRPs which include either cross-cutting or specific references to the role of LRAs in the implementation of activities. For the NRPs 2017, 20 or 74% of NRPs include either cross-cutting or specific references to the role of LRAs in the implementation of activities Obstacles to Investment In 2016, 7 NRPs (25%) include specific references to the territorial perspective related to investment needs. The role of LRAs is highlighted in 8 cases (29%). 15 NRPs (54%) mentioned dedicated policy measures to tackle Obstacles to Investment. For 2017, six NRPs (41%) emphasise the territorial perspective and 11 (70%) mention the role of LRAs. 19 NRPs (70%) include policy measures measures. Institutional Capacity In all five years 2011-2015, many countries\u2019 NRPs reference the importance of strengthening or developing the administrative capacity of LRAs for implementing the NRP - the highest percentage had been reached with the 2016 NRPs (71%). For 2017 a total of nine NRPs (33%) including direct references have been identified. ",
        "30 Specific institutional capacity-building measures targeting LRAs have been mentioned by 12 NRPs in 2015 and 2016 (43% for 2015 and 43% for 2016). For 2017 a total of ten NRPs (37%) mention institutional capacity-building activities. Partnership and Multi-Level Governance Coordination among the tiers of government has been explicitly mentioned in 23 cases (82%) in 2015 and in 18 cases in 2016 (64%). The mention of broader partnerships such as Territorial Pacts is rare in the NRPs for 2011-2014, with one NRP mentioning a partnership in 2011 (Romania) and one in 2013 (the UK); in 2014, the Luxembourgish NRP highlighted the example of the Climate Pact. Since the 2015 report, the question has been formulated more openly, searching the NRPs for cooperation models involving LRAs. About 64% of the NRPs (18) have included such references across a variety of sectors in 2015 and 54% (15) in 2016. Wider partnerships, mainly with social partners and CSOs, were included in 25 NRPs (89%) in 2015 and in 23 NRPs (82%) in 2016. For 2017, 56 % (15) references to coordination between different tiers of government are found. 41% of the NRPs (11) have included references to cooperation models. 63% of NRPs mention wider partnerships. ",
        "31 4 Conclusions The overall picture of LRA involvement in the NRPs remains similar to 2016. The highest aggregate scores can be found in Central and Northwest European EU-15 countries with a long tradition of regional self-governance, which is reflected in frequent references to LRA responsibilities. Some peripheral MS show high scores, too; however, they are only partly identical with the ones that showed high scores in 2016. The results seem to indicate that, with a few exceptions, LRA involvement in Mediterranean and CEE MS in the NRP process is not anchored as deeply in the political processes as in the first group of MS resulting in fluctuations caused by contingencies changing every year. Countries with ongoing administrative reforms show a tendency for a more intense coverage of LRA involvement than comparable countries without such reform programmes. The NRPs BE, CY, DE, ES, FI, FR, LV explicitly mention such reforms. The majority of NRPs does reflect a territorial dimension although the rationale and approach differ quite strongly. 18 programmes do include at least one or more elements which can be considered as specific policy approach for certain regions. It should be mentioned that more NRPs mention specific policies targeted at Obstacles to investment than last year \u2013 obviously mirroring an increasing weight of the new policy focus in the elaboration of the NRP. When it comes to the role of LRAs in the implementation of policies related to the NRP the aftermath of the economic crisis leaves its mark on the issues where LRA responsibilities are explicitly involved: the prevalent recurrent topic of the NRPs is social protection. It is by far the issue which is most often cited in connection with the involvement of LRAs. The topic has a clear territorial dimension since it concerns primarily regions with high unemployment, often threatened by a \u201cvicious circle\u201d of shrinking or ageing population, rising social expenses, infrastructural deficits and diminishing economic base. Other topics, like health care, which were recorded in last year\u2019s NRPs tend to be less prominent in this year. Additional topics, where the involvement of LRAs is explicit, are employment initiatives, education programmes and improvements to the business environment. Concerning the role of LRAs in preparation and evaluation of NRPs the fact that eight EU-13 countries, but only one EU-15 country (LU), are not involved in the preparation of the NRPs seems to be most noticeable. The picture is very similar for evaluation of NRPs, where seven EU-13 countries and only three EU-15 ",
        "32 countries (ES, LU, PT) are not involved. The figures seem to reflect centralised political traditions in the CEEC (and also in the Mediterranean area). The large refugee flows since summer 2015 leave an even stronger mark in the NRPs of some of the most affected countries than last year (BE, DE, EE, FI, LU, SE as compared to DE, SE, SI last year). The topic manifests itself in three dimensions: as territorial challenge (BE, EE, FI, SE), in the implementation of CSR and Europe 2020 (BE, DE, LU, SE) and as a matter of institutional capacities (SE). Obviously, the budgetary and financial consequences of the integration efforts have started materializing. As an important challenge some of the NRPs stress the constraints put on public budgets with their consequences for LRAs. The general picture broadly fits to the findings in the Territorial Analysis of the Country Reports (CRs) done by CoR. The Study also highlights social policies, health care, housing and pensions as one of the most frequent territorial challenges mentioned in the CRs. In the CoR Analysis education, training and RDTI rank second in terms of frequency \u2013 a point which is not exactly mirrored in the analysis of NRPs \u2013 in particular when it comes to RTDI. Public administration ranks third in frequency in the Study on CRs. Obstacle to investment can be considered as one of the major underlying rationales of the NRP as such: CSRs and thus also many policy elements in response to the CSRs refer implicitly or explicitly to obstacles for investment. A territorial perspective on the issue is only found in a small number of NRPs. Rather concrete references to the governance issue, i.e. the framework for investment at LRA level range from the fiscal equalisation systems such as in AT and DE or the reform of the financing system for the local level (ES) to the role of ESIF policies for the local level. This is also reflected in related policy areas where taxation plays a major role. A second relatively frequent issue is housing policy which - next to its social dimension \u2013 is also crucial for the mobility of labour force. With a view to public administration the role of administrative capacities is addressed specifically in this year\u2019s NRP analysis. In many cases the approaches to policy fields with an increasing role of LRAs would indicate the need for capacity-building but it is rarely made explicit. One major incentive to explicitly report on the issue have been low absorption capacities in SF respectively ESIF in the previous periods. In such cases the EC has intervened and pinpointed the need for capacity building in many of the regular review processes in Cohesion Policy. ",
        "33 Partnership and MLG plays a major role in the EU-15 but also in PL whereas the NRPs of EU-13 MS with rather centralised political systems include only minor or no reference to inter-administrative coordination. Among multi-level or partnership-based cooperation models education is an important topic. ",
