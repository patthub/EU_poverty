( 2 ) OJ C 224, 27.6.2018, p. 58. ",
        "C. whereas the Eastern Partnership pursues the common goals of promoting stability, confidence-building and cooperation, supporting democratic reforms, strengthening and consolidating democratic institutions, good neighbourly relations, peaceful conflict resolution and regional cooperation, enhancing people-to-people contacts and boosting trade, in order to enhance political dialogue and association as well as economic cooperation and integration; whereas, alongside the principle of differentiation, every partner country is offered the opportunity to enhance its political and economic relations with the EU, to the extent that this corresponds to its ambition; whereas pursuant to Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and in line with the Rome Declaration of 25 March 2017, any European state may apply to become a member of the EU, provided it adheres to the Copenhagen criteria and the principles of democracy, that it respects fundamental freedoms and human rights, including those of minority groups, and that it upholds the rule of law; D. whereas all of the Eastern European Partners as sovereign states should decide freely on the course of their foreign and security policies without external pressure or being exposed to the risk of military or economic reprisals, as is required by international law; E. whereas, at the 2017 Brussels Eastern Partnership Summit, the participants highlighted the role of the Eastern Partnership in strengthening state, economic and societal resilience in the EU's neighbourhood as also outlined in the Global Strategy for the EU's Foreign and Security Policy and the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy; F. whereas good governance and progress towards democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as sustainable economic development and poverty reduction, are important elements for ensuring stability and strengthening internal security and reinforcing the resilience of partner countries, helping them to create an enabling environment for the development of more resilient and competitive economies; whereas a vibrant and independent civil society, as well as independent media, are vital in creating resilient societies; G. whereas unprecedented security challenges in Europe, encompassing both conventional and hybrid warfare, extremism and radicalisation, cybercrime, terrorism and organised crime, have emerged and cannot be solved without shared responsibility and cooperation; H. whereas the EU has renewed its commitment to promote the stabilisation and resilience of its Partners, and has earmarked further resources in the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy framework for this purpose; whereas the EU has included the fight against cybercrime and corruption, and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, among its priorities in the security field; whereas it is of the utmost importance to ensure that the EU's post-2020 multiannual financial framework (MFF) maintains a separate financial instrument for the neighbourhood as clear evidence of the political importance the EU attaches to the region, and to ensure the long-term tangible impact of reforms; I. whereas, both in the EU and the Eastern European Partners, citizens, companies and administrations rely heavily on information and communication technologies and are therefore increasingly vulnerable to cybercrimes; whereas responding to cyber incidents requires abilities, expertise, technologies and intelligence that need to be developed in the EU Member States and Eastern European Partners; whereas it is obvious that the Russian Government has been responsible for cyber-attacks against several EU and partner states; J. whereas, since November 2017, the Commission has been engaging in a consultation on the issues arising from the spread of false information across traditional and social media and the best means of countering it; K. whereas, in September 2015, the EU established the East Strategic Communication Task Force (East StratCom) as an instrument to counter Russian propaganda and disinformation, which remains insufficiently funded; L. whereas unresolved conflicts affecting Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova, and ongoing Russian military aggression in eastern Ukraine have caused grievous loss of life and remain a major challenge to the democratic development and security of the region; M. whereas Russia has generated and sustained some of these conflicts as part of its strategy of playing a predominant regional role in Eastern Europe as well as of using a military presence as leverage to exert pressure on partner countries, in contradiction with its international commitments to uphold the international legal order; whereas Russia illegally maintains military forces in the occupied territories and separatist regions of Georgia and Moldova respectively, and provides leadership, personnel and military equipment to separatist forces in Ukraine; whereas Russia illegally maintains military forces and considerable amounts of ammunition and military equipment in the occupied territory and separatist region of Transnistria in the Republic of Moldova, and has conducted joint military exercises with the military forces of the Transnistrian regime; 25.9.2018 C 343/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "N. whereas the occupation by the Russian Federation of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia following the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, and the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by the Russian Federation in 2014, have been a brutal demonstration of a disregard for international law; whereas the total militarisation of these territories by the occupying Russian authorities poses a significant threat to regional and pan-European security; whereas a deterioration in the human rights situation is visible in the occupied territories, most notably the killing and political persecution of Georgian and Ukrainian citizens, particularly Crimean Tatars; O. whereas the EU supports the full and genuine implementation of the Minsk arrangements in eastern Ukraine and the prolongation of sanctions tied to full implementation; whereas the EU supports the 1999 Istanbul decision of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as regards the Republic of Moldova as well as the conversion of the current peacekeeping operation on the Dniester river into a civilian mission with an internat\u00ad ional mandate, and the OSCE Minsk Group and its Co-Chairs in their efforts to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and avoid any new eruption of violence and military fighting; whereas the EU insists on the full implementation of the EU-brokered ceasefire agreement between Georgia and Russia by the Russian Federation and supports the Geneva International Discussions (GID) established to address the consequences of the 2008 Russo-Georgian war employing instruments of conflict resolution such as GID co-chairmanship, the deployment of the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) in Georgia's occupied territories, full support for the non-recognition and engagement policy, and the reversal of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Russian Federation; P. whereas the EU carries out actions aimed at complementing these efforts by promoting confidence- and peace- building activities across the conflict divide, inter alia, through the positive efforts of the EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus, and through the implementation of the \u2018European Partnership for the peaceful settlement of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019 (EPNK) programme, aimed at bringing the respective civil societies closer; Q. whereas the hazards posed by chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) materials are a major concern for the security of populations; whereas the nerve gas attack by the Russian government on former intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal, in Salisbury on 4 March 2018 must be seen as a threat to European security as such; R. whereas a more coherent and assertive EU approach and a resolve to address the Russian Federation with one voice using all the instruments at the EU's disposal, in particular conditionalities and sanctions, can make EU action more effective in addressing the security challenges of the Eastern Partnership countries; Advancing stability by strengthening Eastern European Partners' democratic governance, economic and social development 1. Stresses that progress towards good democratic governance, respect for human rights, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and a reduction in corruption in the Eastern European Partners is the key for maintaining their security and reducing societal vulnerabilities to internal and external destabilising attempts; calls on the Eastern European Partners to pursue political reforms or initiate new ones on the basis of democratic principles and the rule of law, bearing in mind that these reforms are essential to building up citizens' confidence in state institutions; calls for the Eastern European Partners, as well as the EU, to ensure equal rights for all citizens, including for national minorities and their languages; 2. Stresses that upholding good governance in law enforcement, security and defence institutions is key to protecting the Eastern European Partners from attempts at destabilisation; urges the Partners' parliaments to fully exercise their democratic oversight over law enforcement agencies and military and security services; 3. Underlines the role of human rights defenders organisations, the independent media and civil society organisations in contributing to democratisation processes and exercising civic oversight; calls on the Partners to ensure that they enjoy robust protection; urges the Partners to fully implement the outstanding judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, particularly those pertaining to violations of Article 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights; 4. Supports the Partners' efforts aimed at developing or transforming their economies, removing monopolies and the concentration of ownership in the private sector, guaranteeing a stable economic and legal framework, promoting international trade and making them attractive for foreign investors; takes the view that the Partners should give a new impetus to economic reforms in order to advance towards well-functioning and sustainable social market economies; stresses that further steps need to be considered to deepen bilateral and multilateral regional integration among the Eastern European Partners, as appropriate, and to strengthen regional infrastructure, including energy infrastructure; 25.9.2018 C 343/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "5. Encourages the Commission and the Partners' governments to engage in discussions on the prospects for helping the Partners to advance along their European trajectory by seeking new avenues for deeper integration, that, by way of illustration and depending on the depth and scope of the individual Partner's ambitions, could lead to the accession of associated countries to the EU's customs union, energy union and digital union, in line with mutual interests; 6. Underlines that EU financial support to its Partners should be conditional on concrete reform steps and their effective implementation, and that the EU's incentive-based approach will continue to benefit the Partners most engaged in ambitious reforms, on the basis of the \u2018more for more\u2019 principle; stresses further that EU support should be tailor-made to match the level of shared ambition for cooperation with each Partner; calls on the Commission, in this context, to further reinforce programmes dedicated to Association countries to provide robust assistance for complex reforms by Associated Partners, notably to support legal approximation and sectoral integration efforts; 7.

Calls for dialogue in the field of security and defence between, on the one hand, the EU and its Member States, and, on the other, the Eastern European Partners, to be strengthened where appropriate, and for further cooperation in the field of Common Foreign and Security Policy/Common Security and Defence Policy (CFSP/CSDP); welcomes the EU's value-based engagement in a number of CSDP missions, for instance the EUMM in Georgia and the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) in Ukraine; welcomes the Partners' contributions, in particular those by Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, to CSDP; 9. Expresses deep concerns over the use of CBRN weapons and Russia's involvement in the attack against former intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal on 4 March 2018; calls on Russia to respect its commitment to the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their precursors; calls for the EU to reinforce cooperation with its Partners in order to mitigate the risks arising from CBRN materials and related technological expertise; Advancing towards a peaceful settlement of regional conflicts 10. Reiterates that sovereignty, independence and the peaceful settlement of disputes are key principles of the European security order; stresses that the resolution of conflicts in Eastern Europe is essential to enhance the security and stability of the entire continent; considers that these conflicts remain a major threat to the independence and sovereignty of the Partners, to the security of the region and beyond, and a potential source of instability for the whole of Europe; continues to firmly support the principle of territorial integrity of the Partners within their internationally recognised borders; maintains that the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and the 1990 OSCE Charter of Paris represent the cornerstones of a peaceful European continent; 11.

Condemns Russia's foreign policy that aims to maintain an influence in the policy-making of its neighbours, through encouraging and supporting de facto authorities of separatist regions in Ukraine and Moldova and of occupied territories of Georgia, thereby undermining the restoration of their sovereignty over these regions and their territorial integrity, and preventing the safe and dignified return of internally displaced persons (IDPs); 25.9.2018 C 343/4 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "considers the ongoing Russian military aggression in eastern Ukraine to be the most important challenge to security in Europe; reiterates its support to the full implementation of the Minsk arrangements, but is disappointed by the lack of progress; takes note of the ongoing talks between US and Russian Special Representatives on a possible deployment of a UN-mandated peacekeeping operation in eastern Ukraine; invites the leaders of the Normandy Format to engage in discussing this option and to take new initiatives; continues to support all efforts to secure a lasting peaceful solution which respects the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in particular by the deployment \u2013 with the consent of the Ukrainian authorities \u2013 of a peace-building and peacekeeping mission to the whole territory of Ukraine; calls for safe and unrestricted access for international monitoring along the Ukrainian Russian border; 13.

Underlines the strategic importance of the ENP, as a policy creating multi-layered relations; highlights the fact that the fundamental challenge of the ENP lies in delivering tangible and concrete improvements to the citizens of the partner countries; considers that the ENP should become a stronger and more efficient policy, inter alia through the reinforcement of its positive elements, including a greater focus on developing effective investment policies based on EU best practice; 2. Believes in the continued value of the ENP's initially stated objectives of creating an area of prosperity, stability, security and good neighbourliness, based on the common values and principles of the European Union, by providing assistance and incentives for deep structural economic reforms in the neighbouring countries, carried out under their own responsibility and agreed with them, which will allow for reinforced engagement with the EU; stresses, therefore, the need to attract more FDI in order to ensure economic development; 3. Emphasises that FDI attraction, transparency, good governance, mutual accountability and inclusiveness should be key aspects of the new approach so as to ensure that the benefits of the ENP reach all levels of society in the countries concerned, rather than being concentrated within particular groups; 4. Recalls the shared interest of the European Union in helping the Eastern Partnership countries to pursue long-term stable and sound economic growth and to establish modern economic governance, which can be achieved by linking the economies of the Eastern Partnership countries with the EU's single market via DCFTAs with full respect for greater differentiation reflecting the diversity among Eastern Partnership countries; underlines the fact that FDI is essential to ensuring a boost in competitiveness and should lead to productivity enhancement, job creation and long-term sustainable growth; 5. Stresses that deeper market integration between the EU and the Eastern Partnership countries could contribute to stimulating economic growth in both the EU and the EaP, and to eliminating regional economic imbalances and social inequalities between and within these countries and regions, and therefore enhance the welfare of their respective populations, a significant outcome particularly at a time of slow economic recovery and rising social and economic inequality as well as geopolitical instability; 6. Stresses that FDI can be instrumental in achieving the economic paradigm shift towards productive and sustainable investments and exports; stresses also that FDI can contribute to the required competitiveness boost by developing skills and infrastructure, as well as opening new markets for goods and services from Eastern Partnership countries and facilitating their participation in pan-European value chains; 7. Recognises that, in their transition towards a market economy, the Eastern Partnership countries have opened up to FDI, but have so far attracted a rather limited amount; considers that further efforts are needed to provide a stable business environment and for these countries to reach their full potential in the area of the rule of law; 8. Notes that FDI could help the Eastern Partners to diversify their energy supply and improve energy infrastructure, and thus to achieve supply independence and greater efficiency; 25.9.2018 C 343/9 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "9. Notes that the Eastern Partnership countries have undertaken major efforts towards the improvement of their general investment environment; notes also that recent and ongoing reforms have focused on two main pillars, namely alignment with EU rules and regulations, and the introduction of international best practice in support of private sector development; 10. Recognises that EU financial and technical assistance financed through instruments such as the ENI and MFA have contributed to creating a better business climate in Eastern Partners and to attracting greater amounts of FDI; 11. Emphasises that good laws do not automatically translate into a conducive investment climate, and that the quality of public administration and its capacity to implement these laws have an important role to play; considers, in this respect, that additional efforts are required in the Eastern Partnership countries; believes that the implementation of reforms in public administration and the judiciary, as well as the fight against corruption, are essential to achieving excellence; considers that civil services must be professionalised and better remunerated and that public service reform will require better use of IT facilities, training and rationalisation of resources; believes that a strong focus must also be placed on improving governance; 12. Notes that the Eastern Partnership countries can attract more and higher-value FDI with appropriate policies; affirms that more FDI would help to achieve the countries' national development goals and the Sustainable Development Goals by contributing to job creation, technology transfer, export promotion, sustainable growth and poverty alleviation; notes that higher-value FDI would lead to improvements in infrastructure development, sectoral diversification and the improvement of education systems; 13. Highlights the fact that transparent FDI could be instrumental in reducing the share and role of the informal economy in Eastern Partners, thus helping to combat tax evasion, organised crime and corruption; 14. Argues that the creation of jobs through FDI could be advantageous in terms of reducing youth unemployment; believes also that FDI in sectors requiring skilled labour would help decrease the number of young unemployed or low-paid graduates when coupled with active labour market policies and an emphasis on relevant skills in education and training; 15. Stresses that promoting women entrepreneurship could be an effective tool in stimulating economic growth, decreasing unemployment, promoting inclusivity and gender equality, and reducing social imbalances; 16. Emphasises the importance of SMEs for the economies of Eastern Partners; argues that investments in SMEs offer the best opportunity for generating sustainable growth, combating unemployment and boosting trade between the Eastern Partnership countries and the EU; urges the EU and its Member States, and the Eastern Partners to work together towards attracting more FDI to SMEs in the latter; 17. Realises that Eastern Partnership countries will also be in a better position to reconsider their tax base, which in turn will provide funding to improve living standards and, with time, reduce their dependence on international assistance and remittances; believes that this would eventually allow Eastern Partnership countries to turn to more progressive taxation in order to bridge inequalities and social divides in their societies; 18. Recognises that, while one of the objectives of the Eastern Partnership countries is to receive more FDI relying on skilled labour, the Partners must undertake additional efforts to enhance certain professional skills among their own populations; points out that, although FDI can help in this process in various ways, it cannot act as a substitute for the role of national education systems in providing the necessary skills for a strong economy, re\u00ad sponsibility for which lies with governments; 19. Calls for a large injection of investment in the Eastern Partnership countries' infrastructure, labour skills and economic development, which goes beyond enhancing the capacity of the local public or private sectors; 20. Urges the authorities of the Eastern Partners to develop a set of incentives for job creation in order to attract FDI, with the purpose of significantly increasing the weight of the private sector in job generation; 21. Urges that short-, medium- and long-term priorities and strategic objectives be defined, bearing in mind that the ENP should aim to create a differentiated approach to promote investment attraction; stresses that, in defining its approach, the EU should look at its interests and priorities and those of the individual countries concerned, together with their level of development, taking due account of the interests and aspirations of their societies, political ambitions and the geopolitical environment; 25.9.2018 C 343/10 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

Emphasises the importance of communication policies, the need to demonstrate the benefit of reforms to the citizens of the Eastern Partnership countries, and the need, therefore, to further strengthen strategic communi\u00ad cations efforts; 31. Supports the implementation of best practice promoted by the EU, Eastern European Partners and international and regional organisations, including financial institutions, banks and donors in individual countries, to promote FDI; 32. Encourages the EU Member States to develop stronger bilateral and multilateral links with the Eastern Partnership countries and to be actively involved in transitional assistance, technical support, capacity building and experience sharing with a view to promoting FDIs, as well raising awareness of the opportunities afforded by the DCFTA; 33. Recognises that many of the challenges faced by the Eastern Partners are shared ones; encourages, therefore, stronger cooperation and forward-looking political dialogue between the Eastern Partnership countries to address common challenges and encourage investment; 34. Urges that steps be taken to prevent money laundering and to ensure transparency and social responsibility regarding foreign investments; 35. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the President of the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Commission, the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, the European External Action Service, and the governments and parliaments of the EU Member States and of the Eastern European partner countries. 25.9.2018 C 343/11 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

        "D. whereas the Commission has proposed a new directive on transparent and predictable working conditions; E. whereas the Commission has presented a proposal for a Council recommendation on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed; F. whereas the Commission has announced the establishment of a European Labour Authority to ensure that EU rules on labour mobility are enforced; whereas it has also announced plans to introduce a European Social Security Number; G. whereas the European neighbourhood policy, in particular the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, and visa-free travel arrangements have far-reaching implications for the labour market and the social conditions of employees both in the EU Member States and the Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries; whereas cross-border business requires cooperation among national labour monitoring and enforcement bodies to ensure the implementation of existing legislation; H. whereas unemployment, corruption and bad governance, and violent conflicts in the EU neighbourhood force people to leave their homes and find work where they can, including abroad; whereas refugees and immigrants are more likely to become undeclared workers without social protection and are often employed for unskilled work; whereas refugees and migrants, in particular women, represent the most vulnerable groups on the labour market and in society as a whole; I. whereas the social consequences of the global financial and economic crisis and the transformation processes in EU Member States and EaP countries have been far-reaching, from youth and long-term unemployment to growing inequality and poverty; whereas these developments, which are often a by-product of austerity measures, have resulted in a number of changes in the social security systems of EU Member States and neighbourhood countries that have led to reduced standards, including in the areas of healthcare and pensions; whereas labour code reforms have resulted in deregulation and liberalisation, but have not reduced the informal economy; J. whereas undeclared work often has a cross-border dimension; whereas the nature of undeclared work may vary from one country to the other, depending on the economic, administrative and social context; whereas national legislation on undeclared work and the definitions used at national level differ from country to country; whereas measures to tackle undeclared work should therefore be tailored to take account of these differences; K. whereas the possibility of finding undeclared work is a key pull factor in encouraging illegal immigration; whereas residents with irregular or non-regulated status, who tend to fall outside the social security system, are often offered undeclared work under conditions that are socially unacceptable and in breach of health and safety regulations or national collective agreements; L. whereas labour markets and societies are evolving in both the EU Member States and the EaP countries, with substantial challenges arising from the digital revolution, changing working patterns and demographic developments, creating new challenges and opportunities for the labour market; M. whereas despite the fact that severe forms of labour exploitation are criminalised under EU and EU Member State law, there are cases in which exploitation in the domestic work sector, for example in roles involving cleaning and caring for children or the elderly, is tolerated; General remarks 1. Stresses that the fight against undeclared work and measures to guarantee social security constitute a serious joint challenge for EU Member States and EaP countries and should therefore become the subject of joint efforts and cooperation; 2. Recognises that undeclared work is a complex and demanding challenge, especially for countries encountering difficult socioeconomic circumstances marked by high unemployment, widespread poverty and social exclusion, a poor business environment and a lack of fiscal space; stresses, however, that undeclared work has serious consequences for societies in general, including lost revenue for national tax authorities, the undermining of social welfare funding and distribution, precarious working conditions and systemic risks relating to violations of fundamental workers' rights, a lack of collective representation and unfair competition between businesses; underlines, therefore, that coherent and integrated national strategies and international cooperation are needed to facilitate the transition from the informal to the formal economy; 25.9.2018 C 343/20 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "3. Regrets, therefore, that the complex web of issues linked to undeclared work, to the transition from informal to formal as regards the economy and work, and to the social security of workers has not so far been a focus of Eastern Partnership policy; 4. Points to the fact that a public administration and judicial system that can be trusted by citizens discourages undeclared work; underlines, therefore, that the rule of law, good governance and the eradication of corruption are crucial for the transition from the informal to the formal economy; 5. Expresses concern at the level of youth unemployment and the number of young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs) in the EU and the EaP countries, and the level of youth participation in the shadow economy; stresses that it is young people who carry a country's cultural, economic and social heritage forward into the future and that priority should therefore now be given to job creation for young people and to measures that encourage those working undeclared to move into the declared economy; points out that the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the successor to the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) should provide increased support to youth employment in the official economy by employing the good practices developed under the Youth Employment Initiative; 6. Encourages the development of a system through which qualifications obtained in EaP countries are recognised in the EU; 7. Reiterates the importance of zero-tolerance policies in public procurement and in lending by international financial institutions (the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank) on undeclared work, including in sub- contracting and supply chains; Short-term measures 8. Calls on the EU Member States and the EaP countries to increase public awareness of the urgent need for action and to step up their efforts to tackle undeclared work, including through public awareness campaigns in conjunction with the social partners; calls on the Commission to support the EU Member States and the EaP countries in ensuring the effective provision of information about the implications of undeclared work for workers, businesses and society, and about workers' rights stemming from the international labour norms enshrined in the ILO conventions, including complaint and appeal procedures; stresses the need to increase awareness among the general public of the fact that people working undeclared can be severely exploited and to promote a climate of zero tolerance of the exploitation of such workers, including their exploitation in private households; 9. Encourages the EU and EaP countries that have not yet done so to ratify and promote in practice the relevant ILO conventions and recommendations, including Nos 94 (Labour Clauses (Public Contracts)), 102 (Social Security (Minimum Standards)), 144 (Tripartite Consultation), 155 (Occupational Safety and Health) and its Protocol of 2002, 167 (Safety and Health in Construction), 177 (Home Work), 184 (Safety and Health in Agriculture), 187 (Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health), 189 (Domestic Workers), 202 (Social Protection Floors), 204 (Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy) and 205 (Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience); 10. Takes the view that much more emphasis should be placed on the implementation of provisions related to the \u2018trade and sustainable development\u2019 and \u2018employment, social policy and equal opportunity\u2019 chapters of the bilateral agreements between the EU and the EaP; calls on the Commission to provide extensive information about the implementation of the relevant provisions in the AA/DCFTAs with Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine in the context of the annual implementation reports, as well as progress towards the implementation of the relevant provisions of the EU-Armenia CEPA following its ratification; 11. Calls for the establishment under the EaP multilateral architecture of an institutional cooperation mechanism to tackle undeclared work; recommends the establishment of a multilateral (sub)platform under the Directorate- General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion that could provide the EaP bodies, including Platform 2, with input on the social and labour aspects of trade and economic cooperation; 12. Takes the view that a mechanism based on an exchange of best practices and the improvement of data collection could be established following the example of the UDW platform; points out that such a mechanism should provide a framework to assess the factors, characteristics, causes and circumstances relating to informal and undeclared work and poor working conditions in a national and cross-border context, and to exchange best practices on how to enhance the social security of workers and promote decent work and social protection for all; 25.9.2018 C 343/21 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "13. Calls on the Member States and the EaP countries to conclude bilateral agreements on data exchange and adminis\u00ad trative cooperation on cross-border undeclared work; stresses the need to develop practical tools to combat organised forms and networks of cross-border undeclared work; 14. Welcomes the adoption of the European Pillar of Social Rights; calls on the EU Member States and the EaP countries to hold discussions at their next high-level meeting on how to adapt Eastern Partnership policy in the light of the European Pillar of Social Rights and to develop a common framework for analysing the state of the implementation of fundamental social rights, using the 20 principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the social indicator scoreboard as a reference, and with the long-term goal of the adherence of the EaP countries to the 20 principles; 15. Is of the opinion that the UDW platform established may contribute to increased cooperation, bringing together experts from both EU and EaP countries; calls on the EU to reflect on a mechanism that could enable non-EU countries to participate in the activities of the UDW Platform and benefit from them; 16. Calls for the employment and decent work promotion programmes to be opened up to the EaP countries; 17. Stresses that labour inspection plays an important role in protecting employees' rights, ensuring health and safety in the workplace, combating unsafe working environments, preventing breaches of employment protection rules and promoting fair and socially responsible economic growth, inasmuch as it helps to ensure that wages are actually paid and social security contributions made, thus increasing tax revenue and the inflow of money to social security systems and ensuring that employees are covered for sickness, accidents in the workplace and pensions; deplores the fact that labour inspection authorities have been weakened or even abolished as a consequence of austerity measures and transition processes; calls, in particular, on the EaP countries to reverse this development and to provide the national labour inspection authorities with adequate funding, staffing and training; calls on the Commission to support cross-border training and other forms of cooperation among national labour inspection authorities; 18. Notes the important role played by social partners in many EU Member States in combating undeclared work; stresses the need to step up social dialogue and consultation of social partners in EaP countries in order to involve them in improving working conditions, labour standards and social protection; 19. Advises national authorities in EU Member States to encourage domestic alliances against undeclared work in the fields most affected, such as construction, transport, tourism and agriculture; 20. Underlines the important role of trade unions in combating undeclared work and protecting undeclared workers, as trade unions are usually the first bodies to be made aware of problematic, fraudulent, abusive or illegal situations; notes with concern the difficulties that trade unions face in the EaP countries, ranging from limitations on the freedom of association and assembly to impediments to pursuing social dialogue; calls on the EU Member States and the EaP countries to provide for the conditions necessary for trade unions to act, and calls on the European Commission to continue supporting them; 21. Encourages members of the business community in the EU and the EaP countries to assume their corporate social responsibility in fighting undeclared work, including in supply chains; reminds them that undeclared work creates unfair market competition; 22. Welcomes the establishment of Working Group 5 on social and labour policies and social dialogue within the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum; proposes that this working group contribute to the ongoing discussion on combating undeclared work through its own contributions on the role of civil society; 23. Calls for the EU to dedicate some of the assistance provided to the EaP countries, which will be deployed under the financial instruments of the post-2020 MFF, to this complex set of issues, including support to the institutional development of labour inspection systems, and to strengthening social dialogue and the capacities of the social partners, including at sectoral level, as well as civil dialogue and the work of civil society organisations in general; 25.9.2018 C 343/22 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "Long-term measures 24. Stresses that the transition from the informal to the formal economy should be part of a broader long-term strategy to increase structured job creation, improve job quality and access to employment support, fight the segmentation of the workforce, combat corruption, secure fiscal and social contributions, develop or expand comprehensive social insurance coverage and ensure universal social protection floors in line with ILO Recommendation No 202; 25. Stresses that experience shows that both empowering authorities to enforce compliance with existing legislation and providing incentives, such as income tax relief and subsidy schemes aimed at regularising jobs, successfully contribute to moving undeclared work into declared work; calls on the EU Member States and the EaP countries to develop a long-term roadmap with verifiable benchmarks; 26. Encourages EaP countries to develop national capabilities for preventing and tackling undeclared work with the wide participation of stakeholders, including social partners and NGOs; 27. Stresses that the attractiveness of undeclared work can be effectively reduced by developing transparent tax and public social protection systems that are accessible and appealing; calls on the EU Member States and the EaP countries to develop national strategies aimed at achieving comprehensive social security systems in line with ILO Recommendation No 202 on social protection floors and with Convention No 102 on social security, so as to extend coverage to the currently uncovered population in the informal economy and to adequately address the issue of undeclared work; 28. Encourages EU Member States and EaP countries to conclude bilateral agreements, especially in the case of those countries experiencing a trend in emigration and immigration fluxes that ultimately generates undeclared work; 29. Calls on the Member States and the EaP countries to develop a common framework for social security coordination, in order to safeguard the social security entitlements of mobile workers; 30. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the President of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the European External Action Service, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States and of the Eastern Partnership countries. 25.9.2018 C 343/23 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

        "8. Supports the perspective of the association of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine with the Schengen area and their integration into the EU's customs union, energy union and single digital market; 9. Believes that the new MFF should explicitly reflect the strategic priority of supporting the Eastern European partners on their path towards EU integration, and that the special status of being European states neighbouring the EU is a defining factor that must be acknowledged in the MFF; 10. Believes that the merger of the traditional European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) with other financing instruments designed for various regions would send a politically wrong and damaging signal to other countries, especially the associated partners, and would be interpreted as an indication of reduced political interest on the EU's part in the Eastern Partnership region; 11. Urges maintaining the principles of differentiation and \u2018more for more\u2019, in order to incentivise the reform endeavours of the partners, noting that merging all external instruments into one may challenge the performance- based approach and shift the focus from better-performing countries to those with more acute challenges; 12. Urges the EU institutions to maintain the ENI as a separate financing instrument tailor-made for the EU Neighbourhood, in order to effectively address the existing priorities, needs and challenges of the associated countries and ensure the security and stability of the region and the EU, as well as the sustainability and consistency of EU assistance. 25.9.2018 C 343/28 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
