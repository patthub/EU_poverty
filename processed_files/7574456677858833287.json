The Union shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child. (2) Pursuant to Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union, in defining and implementing its policies and activities, shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion and a high level of education, training and protection of human health. (3) Article 151 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the Union and the Member States, having in mind fundamental social rights such as those set out in the European Social Charter signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and in the 1989 Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, shall have as their objectives the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation while the improvement is being maintained, proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion. (4) Article 152 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the Union recognises and promotes the role of the social partners at its level, taking into account the diversity of the national systems. It shall facilitate dialogue between them and respect their autonomy. (5) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, first proclaimed at the Nice European Council on 7 December 2000, safeguards and promotes a number of fundamental principles that are essential for the European social model. The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. (6) The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union contains provisions laying down the powers of the Union relating, inter alia, to the freedom of movement of workers (Articles 45 to 48), the right of establishment (Articles 49 to 55), social policy (Articles 151 to 161), the promotion of dialogue between management and labour (Article 154), including agreements concluded and implemented at Union level (Article 155), equal pay for men and women for equal work (Article 157), the contribution to the development of quality education and vocational training (Articles 165 and 166), Union action complementing national policies and fostering cooperation in the field of health (Article 168), economic, social and territorial cohesion (Articles 174 to 178), the formulation, and the surveillance of the implementation, of the broad guidelines of the economic policies (Article 121), the formulation, and the examination of the implementation of the employment guidelines (Article 148) and more generally, the approximation of legislation (Articles 114 to 117). 29.4.2017 L 113/56 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "(7) The European Parliament called for a solid European Pillar of Social Rights to reinforce social rights and deliver a positive impact on people's lives in the short and medium term and enable support for European construction in the 21st century ( 1 ). The European Council stressed that economic and social insecurity needs to be addressed as a matter of priority and called for the creation of a promising future for all, safeguards for our way of life and the provision of better opportunities for youth ( 2 ). The leaders of 27 Member States and of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission made a commitment to work towards a social Europe in the Rome agenda. That commitment is based on the principles of sustainable growth and the promotion of economic and social progress, as well as cohesion and convergence, while upholding the integrity of the internal market ( 3 ). The social partners have committed to continue contributing to a Europe that delivers for its workers and enterprises ( 4 ). (8) The completion of the European single market in the last decades has been accompanied by the development of a solid social acquis which has resulted in progress in the freedom of movement, living and working conditions, equality between women and men, health and safety at work, social protection and education and training. The introduction of the euro has provided the Union with a stable common currency shared by 340 million citizens in nineteen Member States, facilitating their daily lives and protecting them against financial instability. The Union has also enlarged significantly, increasing economic opportunities and promoting social progress across the continent. (9) Labour markets and societies are evolving quickly, with new opportunities and new challenges arising from globalisation, the digital revolution, changing work patterns and societal and demographic developments. Challenges, such as significant inequality, long-term and youth unemployment or intergenerational solidarity, are often similar across Member States although in varying degrees. (10) Europe has shown its resolve to overcome the financial and economic crisis, and as a result of determined action, the Union economy is now more stable, with employment levels at an unprecedented high and a steady fall in unemployment. However, the social consequences of the crisis have been far-reaching \u2014 from youth and long- term unemployment to the risk of poverty \u2014 and addressing those consequences remains an urgent priority. (11) To a large extent, the employment and social challenges facing Europe are a result of relatively modest growth, which is rooted in untapped potential in terms of participation in employment and productivity. Economic and social progress are intertwined, and the establishment of a European Pillar of Social Rights should be part of wider efforts to build a more inclusive and sustainable growth model by improving Europe's competitiveness and making it a better place to invest, create jobs and foster social cohesion. (12) The aim of the European Pillar of Social Rights is to serve as a guide towards efficient employment and social outcomes when responding to current and future challenges which are directly aimed at fulfilling people's essential needs, and ensuring better enactment and implementation of social rights. (13) A stronger focus on employment and social performance is particularly important to increase resilience and deepen the Economic and Monetary Union. For this reason, the European Pillar of Social Rights is primarily conceived for the euro area but it is applicable to all Member States that wish to be part of it. (14) The European Pillar of Social Rights expresses principles and rights essential for fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems in 21st century Europe. It reaffirms some of the rights already present in the Union acquis . It adds new principles which address the challenges arising from societal, technological and economic developments. (15) The principles enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights concern Union citizens and third country nationals with legal residence. Where a principle refers to workers, it concerns all persons in employment, regardless of their employment status, modality and duration. 29.4.2017 L 113/57 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) European Parliament resolution of 19 January 2017 on a European Pillar of Social Rights (2016/2095(INI)).

        "(16) The European Pillar of Social Rights shall not prevent Member States or their social partners from establishing more ambitious social standards. In particular, nothing in the European Pillar of Social Rights shall be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting rights and principles as recognised, in their respective fields of application, by Union law or international law and by international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States are party, including the European Social Charter signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and the relevant Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Organisation. (17) Delivering on the European Pillar of Social Rights is a shared commitment and responsibility between the Union, its Member States and the social partners. The principles and rights set by the European Pillar of Social Rights should be implemented at both Union level and Member State level within their respective competences and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. (18) At Union level, the European Pillar of Social Rights does not entail an extension of the Union's powers as defined by the Treaties. It should be implemented within the limits of those powers. (19) At Member State level, the Pillar respects the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe, as well as the national identities of the Member States and the organisation of their public authorities at national, regional and local levels. In particular, the establishment of the Pillar does not affect the right of Member States to define the fundamental principles of their social security systems and should not affect the financial equilibrium thereof. (20) Social dialogue plays a central role in reinforcing social rights and enhancing sustainable and inclusive growth. Social partners at all levels have a crucial role to play in pursuing and implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights, in accordance with their autonomy and the right to collective action.
