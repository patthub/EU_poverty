        "4 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Andris Piebalgs Commissioner for Development European Commission, Founding Donor Philippe Maystadt President of the European Investment Bank Manager of the Trust Fund Joint Foreword by EC Commissioner Piebalgs and EIB President Maystadt 2010 was a very good year for the EU-Africa Infrastruc- ture Trust Fund. Last year the Trust Fund, created in 2007, moved up a gear thanks to a significant number of achievements in several key areas. These are high- lighted and detailed in this Annual Report and relate above all to the volume of operations, the innovative nature of projects and the participation of additional financial institutions in their financing. The Trust Fund forms part of an innovative financial mechanism designed to leverage aid finance from donors by blending it with long-term financing from financial institutions, thereby increasing the impact of both and making certain projects bankable as well as environmentally and socially sustainable. The Euro- pean Union\u2019s development policy is increasingly look- ing at innovative ways of financing as depleted national budgets are not enough to fund aid. The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund came into being as one of the EU\u2019s responses to the challenge of the Mil- lennium Development Goals (MDGs), to the adoption of the EU Strategy for Africa by the European Council in 2005 and to the subsequent creation of several spe- cific EU-Africa partnerships. One such partnership is the Partnership on Infrastructure, aimed at providing improved and sustained African infrastructure with the objective of promoting regional integration, which is key to Africa\u2019s development. The Trust Fund was thus conceived in 2007 as the EU\u2019s main financial instrument for funding and implementing infrastructure projects in Africa with a regional dimension. The EU reaffirmed its commitment to the MDGs and to its partnerships with Africa in 2010 at the UN Summit in New York in September. In doing so it underlined the central role that infrastructure plays in improving com- ",

The global food, fuel and financial crises of 2009 sig- nificantly slowed down growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, from an average of about 6.5% over the period 2004- 2008 to 2.8% in 2009. Fortunately the region is now recovering, with 4.9% growth in 2010, expected to reach 5.5% in 2011. However, to regain momentum in its efforts to achieve the MDGs, Sub-Saharan Africa needs higher growth and renewed investment in infra- structure. To date, EUR 2.2bn is envisaged for invest- ment in regional infrastructure as a result of direct blending with EUR 175m in grants from the Trust Fund (leverage of 13:1), which has also provided an addi- tional EUR 34m for the preparatory phases of other infrastructure projects. The Trust Fund, jointly run through a Steering Com- mittee of EU and African members and managed by the European Investment Bank, is a successful exam- ple of an integrated EU instrument combining grants from the European Development Fund and EU Mem- ber States with loans from eligible financing institu- tions. We are determined to see it contribute further to regional integration in Africa. ",
        "6 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Joint Statement by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee The Steering Committee of the EU-Africa Partnership on Infrastructure provides strategic guidance and over- sight for the instruments of the Partnership, including the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund. Members of the Partnership Steering Committee (PSC) include an equal number of representatives from the European Union and the African Union. We are very pleased with the operational results in 2010, which show an impressive increase on 2009, and with the implementation of several priorities that we recommended for the Trust Fund at our last PSC meet- ing, which took place in Tunis in April 2010. We welcome the African Development Bank (AfDB) as a full member of the Trust Fund\u2019s Project Financiers Group. After resolving legal issues related to the bank\u2019s status as an international organisation, we are now in a position where the AfDB can contribute actively to the identification of priority regional infrastructure projects for Africa and participate in their co-financing. We also note with satisfaction the approval of two grant operations in the ICT sector (the AXIS African Internet Exchange System \u2013 and the Satellite-Enhanced Tele- medicine and e-Health Project, which were among the priority projects of the EU-Africa Partnership on Science, the Information Society and Space. These proj- ects for regional terrestrial backbones and broadband satellite-based networks are fully in line with the out- come and theme of the 14 th African Union (AU) Summit of Heads of States, \u201cInformation and Communication Technologies in Africa: Challenges and Prospects for Development\u201d. The approval of five grants totalling over EUR 43m for transport operations demonstrates that the Trust Fund is making a significant contribution to this priority sec- tor. In this context, we would like to highlight the Great East Road rehabilitation project, not only as an impor- tant transport sector project, but also as an example of the catalytic power of the Trust Fund in regional infrastructure business in Africa.

        "7 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund dination and preparatory work of the EU Delegation in Zambia, the EIB and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppe- ment (AFD), by deploying interest rate subsidies and technical assistance from the Trust Fund, were able to join the EDF and AfDB in co-financing this important section of the regional Nacala Corridor, which links Zambia and Malawi to Nacala port in Mozambique. This project would not have been possible without inter- est rate subsidies totalling more than EUR 25m from the Trust Fund. Overall, the Great East Road rehabilita- tion project in Zambia, with ITF support, has attracted a total of EUR 250m of financing. Furthermore, we note that collaboration with Afri- can banks was enhanced by the provision of EUR 3m of technical assistance funding for clean and renew- able energy projects to the Banque Ouest Africaine de D\u00e9veloppement (BOAD) as well as to local banks in East Africa. With a view to reinforcing the dialogue with African partners, we encourage the Trust Fund Secretariat to continue building synergies with regional organisa- tions and specialised institutions and with the Infra- structure Consortium for Africa, including the sharing of information and coordination of project pipelines between the Trust Fund and the NEPAD-Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility. Finally, we feel that the Trust Fund should further pur- sue the active involvement of the private sector in regional infrastructure projects. We commend the Trust Fund for taking an active part in the EU-Africa Business Forum in Tripoli in November 2010 and we would like to see it explore the potential for collaboration and com- plementarities between private sector companies and the Trust Fund, as was underlined in Tripoli. The Steering Committee welcomes the results achieved in 2010 in line with its recommendations and looks for- ward to further progress in 2011. ",
        "8 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Statement by the Chairman of the Executive Committee First, I would like to express our gratitude to the Trust Fund donors which provided additional financial con- tributions in 2010, i.e. Austria, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Commission (funds from the European Development Fund). I would also like to welcome the three new financial institutions which joined our Project Financiers Group, i.e. the African Development Bank (AfDB \u2013 nominated by the UK), Finnfund (nominated by Finland) and the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) Trust (nom- inated by the Netherlands). All three financiers bring additional experience in project structuring and imple- mentation and specific expertise in the private sector. In the Outlook for 2010 that we provided in the Annual Report of last year, we indicated three broad expec- tations for 2010: an increase in grant approvals to EUR 100m; the identification of grant operations in infra- structure sectors not yet supported by the Trust Fund, i.e. the ICT and water sectors; and diversification in the forms of support provided by the grants beyond those already used, i.e. interest rate subsidies and technical assistance. The Trust Fund exceeded expectations in the above areas, as well as in others. At the operational level, the Trust Fund achieved a record year in 2010. Seventeen grants for EUR 111m were approved in 2010, up from four projects and EUR 15.5m in its first year of operation in 2007, bringing the overall total of approved grant operations to nearly 36 projects and EUR 209m. Almost half of those 36 proj- ects were approved during 2010 alone. In addition, in 2010, three grant operations for EUR 86m received a \u201cClearance in Principle\u201d, i.e. a positive initial decision on their eligibility. All grant operations are described on the following pages of this report. Several grant operations in 2010 that are particularly noteworthy are highlighted in special text boxes.

        "9 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Three grant operations were approved in the ICT sec- tor for the first time. Two of them will be implemented by Lux-Development as the Lead Financier, thereby illustrating the ITF\u2019s potential for providing financial support to smaller institutions and for smaller infra- structure proposals. Another highlight was the co-financing operation of AFD, KfW and the EIB aimed at upgrading and reha- bilitating the water supply and sanitation system of Kampala in Uganda. The project is the first to be pre- sented to the ITF under the framework of the Lake Vic- toria Water and Sanitation (LVWatSan) programme, a multi-donor initiative, including the European Com- mission, which will benefit all the countries around Lake Victoria. Yet another achievement for the ITF in 2010 was the approval of a direct grant for the Seychelles Submarine Cable Project, which is to be co-financed by two mem- bers of the ITF Project Financiers Group, i.e. the EIB and the African Development Bank. The direct grant from the ITF will fund the shareholding of the Seychelles Government in the company in question. The statu- tory dividend for this equity stake will be used to pro- vide free internet access for schools and hospitals and other social services. The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund was quoted by the President of the European Commission in his opening speech to the European Development Days in Brussels on 6 December 2010 as a successful exam- ple of the new European Union Development Policy, based notably on innovative ways of financing. We will strive to keep progressing along this path of innova- tion as a catalyst for growth. ",

        "11 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Purpose and Mechanism of the Fund This \u201cblending\u201d acts as a catalyst for investment, miti- gating the risks taken by the promoters and financiers and giving them an incentive to consider investing in projects which may have a low financial return but which could have a high development impact. With- out the \u201cblending\u201d, such projects could not otherwise be envisaged. The Fund fosters co-financing and technical collabora- tion between numerous stakeholders in line with the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effective- ness and the European Consensus for Development. Its main stakeholders are the European Commission and EU Member States, the African Union and African nations, the European Investment Bank and participat- ing European development finance institutions, the African Development Bank and other potential donors/ private investors involved in the projects. The Fund shares the same broad objectives as the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA), a network of bilateral donors, multilateral agencies and African institutions, which supports infrastructure initiatives in Africa, encouraging information-sharing, good practice and project development. The Fund never- theless has its own unique target, i.e. the financing of infrastructure projects with a regional or continental dimension. Functioning and Governance The Trust Fund is a financial instrument, a component of a \u201cblending mechanism\u201d, which mixes non-refund- able grants from donors with long-term investment finance from financiers.

The Steering Committee does not intervene in the choice of grant operations or the day-to-day running of the Trust Fund, which is the responsibility of the Execu- tive Committee. ",
        "13 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund The Executive Committee As the governing body of the Trust Fund, the Execu- tive Committee includes three categories of members: (i) the voting participants, i.e. the donors (European Commission and EU Member States) which have con- tributed a minimum of EUR 1m; (ii) the non-voting participants, i.e. the EU Member States which are not yet donors; (iii) the European Investment Bank (EIB) as Manager of the Trust Fund, and the Secretariat of the Trust Fund, both of which have non-voting status. The list of the members of the Executive Committee is in Annex 2. The Executive Committee meets four of five times a year and seeks to work on the basis of consensus. How- ever, when a vote is required, and in order to maintain some balance in the decision-making process, it is sub- ject to a double majority rule, i.e. (i) two thirds of the donors in attendance, (ii) representing two thirds of the total voting rights (each million euro contributed representing one voting right). The Executive Committee is responsible for all key deci- sions relating to the Trust Fund, such as examining and approving grant operations and ensuring that all Trust Fund activities comply with terms and conditions of its agreed rules and procedures. Since the inception of the Trust Fund in 2007, the Chair of the Executive Committee has been occupied by its founding donor, i.e. the European Commission. The Chair however can be rotated among Executive Com- mittee members representing donors that have made a contribution commitment of at least EUR 5m. ",

The Project Financiers Group The Financiers of the Trust Fund are institutions with international development project expertise, nominated by the donors 1 . They examine and assess grant operation requests, with a view to submitting them for approval by the Executive Committee with an opinion on their eligi- bility and suitability for funding by the Trust Fund. For each grant operation, a Lead Financier is designated by common agreement among the co-financiers. The Lead Financier henceforth becomes the key coun- terpart of the Executive Committee and the Trust Fund Manager with respect to the implementation and super- vision of the grant operation. The financiers constitute and meet as an informal group, the Project Financiers Group, several times per year in order to discuss and review regional infrastructure projects which might need funding support from the Trust Fund. The Project Finan- ciers Group provides a unique forum for the exchange of technical and operational expertise and for collaboration and co-financing of infrastructure investments in Africa. The Trust Fund Manager The European Investment Bank is the Manager of the Trust Fund. In that role, it is responsible for the Fund\u2019s treasury management and for maintaining the finan- cial records and accounts of the Trust Fund and of the grant operations financed from Trust Fund resources. Its tasks include the preparation and approval of the Trust Fund\u2019s financial statements, which are attached to this report, and the setting-up and administration of the Trust Fund\u2019s Secretariat. The Trust Fund Secretariat The Secretariat of the Trust Fund was established to assist the Executive Committee in carrying out its responsibilities. The Secretariat is hosted by the Man- ager, but is accountable and reports to the Executive Committee. Among the main tasks of the Secretariat are: organising the meetings of the Executive Com- mittee, reporting on the progress and development of the Trust Fund itself and the projects supported by the Fund, preparing statistical analyses on grant oper- ations, preparing and issuing the Trust Fund\u2019s Annual Reports and ensuring proper visibility for the Fund. Request Procedure for Eligible Grant Operations The eligibility criteria for grant support from the Trust Fund focus on the regional dimension of a project \u2013 i.e. the operation must concern either a trans-border pro- ject or a national project with an impact on two or more eligible African countries 2 \u2013 on the African ownership ",

If the PFG concludes that the proposal is considered suitable for ITF grant support, it will submit a recom- mendation to the ITF Executive Committee. 2) Submission of a grant operation request to the Executive Committee for its approval and/or clear- ance in principle: the Executive Committee, which is the group of all donors, will examine the requested grant element of a project in the light of the eligibil- ity criteria and take a final decision. While the Execu- tive Committee focuses only on the grant element, the decision to extend the underlying project loan remains the responsibility of the project financiers. Once the relevant agreement or contract has been signed with a borrower, the Lead Financier may request the ITF Manager to transfer a lump sum equal to the entire amount of the approved grant operation or a part of the approved grant operation. of the project and on sound sustainable development principles such as poverty reduction, contribution to economic development, trade and environmental and social best practice. Eligible projects must belong to one of the four traditional infrastructure sectors: energy, transport, water, and information technology. The Trust Fund can provide grant support in four different forms: (i) interest rate subsidies aimed at reducing the total amount of debt service to be paid by the borrower; (ii) technical assistance, which can include the funding of preparatory work as well as project supervision and targeted capacity building; (iii) direct grants for project components which have substantial demon strable social or environmental benefits; and (iv) insurance premia mitigating certain risks taken by a promoter or a financier in launching a project. Projects may be implemented by public or private entities, or entities with mixed public-private capital. The mandatory channel for formally requesting grant support from the Trust Fund is a financier from the Proj- ect Financiers Group. Project promoters with regional infrastructure investment proposals must approach a PFG member, which in turn will assess whether the proj- ect fulfils the eligibility criteria of the Trust Fund.

Five grant operations are designed to facilitate projects in the transport sector, including three grant opera- tions for the rehabilitation of the Great East Road in Zambia (more information on this project can be found on page 31). As a positive trend, it is worth noting that three grant operations approved in 2010 will help to prepare proj- ects in the ICT sector on a trans-regional basis, two of these under the lead of Lux-Development. The first direct grant operation also supports an ICT project: the Seychelles Submarine Cable project. A highlight of the ITF\u2019s activity in 2010 is its support for improvements in the water and sanitation systems in Kampala and around Lake Victoria. Within the frame- work of the Mutual Reliance Initiative and under the lead of KfW, an AFD/KfW/EIB co-financing plan was established, with further support from the European Commission, for the upgrading and rehabilitation of Kampala\u2019s water supply infrastructure and the asso- ciated transmission mains and distribution system.

The project seeks to improve the living conditions of the people, as well as the quality of the region\u2019s socioeconomic development environment, based on the availability of affordable electrical energy and the access of communities to electricity through increased cross-border electric power trade. While the funding for the project has been largely secured and the preparatory activities for the other lines under the NELSAP project are well advanced, the pre-investment study for the line from Kibuye to Birembo via Goma remains to be undertaken. The investment costs of the Kibuye-Goma-Birembo line have already been allocated by the German Government and the African Development Bank. The Government of the Nether- lands is prepared to co-finance the project and will make a formal decision once the results of the feasi- bility study are available. The consultancy contract for the study on the feasibil- ity of the 220 kV electrical transmission line network of Kibuye-Gisenyi-Goma and Gisenyi-Mukungwa- Birembo covers load forecasting, economical and financial calculations, line routing, tower spotting, a geological survey, an environmental and social impact assessment, data sheets, drawings and price sheets.

        "31 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund This project consists of road reconfiguration and upgrad- ing measures and bridge replacements along a 360 km section of the Great East Road, which is part of the Nacala Corridor, a regional road/rail route passing through Zam- bia, Malawi and Mozambique and linking Lusaka with the port of Nacala. The project also includes a dry port (road and rail interchange) at Chipata in Zambia. The total proj- ect cost is EUR 250m. Other complementary road and rail upgrading work along this corridor in Malawi and Mozam- bique is already under way. The project will improve jour- ney times and safety, thus reducing transport costs and facilitating trade and economic growth in the region. This project provides a good example of how the ITF can assist in securing innovative financing from differ- ent sources to implement large regional infrastructure projects. ITF interest rate subsidies on the EIB and AFD loans comply with the concessional lending require- ments for Highly Indebted Countries and complement other EU and AfDB co-financing operations. The project benefits from long-term road sector support and proj- ect preparatory work previously undertaken by the EU Delegation to Zambia. Good collaboration between the co-financiers has also facilitated the sharing of project documentation and joint missions, generating efficiency savings for the donors and promoter. Similarly, the technical assistance from the ITF will strengthen the capacity of the promoter (Government of Zambia\u2019s Road Development Agency) to implement and sustain the project, while benefiting the works undertaken by all the project\u2019s co-financiers.

The existing road can no longer handle the long-dis- tance heavy traffic and the lighter urban short-distance traffic, resulting in increasing and permanent satura- tion, along with poor pedestrian and two-wheel safety and environment issues. This situation will deteriorate with the implementation of the CEMAC Regional Trans- port and Transit Facilitation Programme, the first phase of which is focused on the Douala-Bangui and Douala- N\u2019Djamena corridors. The Access to Douala Project, which could have been part of this Programme, will contribute to its economic efficiency and will mitigate its negative social and environment impacts on Douala. The interest rate subsidy of EUR 5.7m, which corre- sponds to a 1% interest rebate, will be used by AFD to subsidise its EUR 60m loan to the Republic of Cam- eroon.

Its mission is to support the sound development of its member states, Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, as well as regional integration, by providing funding in the form of equity and loans, inter- est rate subsidies and technical assistance to a range of infrastructure sectors. The proposed technical assistance is part of an EIB credit line and equity investment and will cover three com- ponents related to climate change and environmen- tal expertise at BOAD. The first component is a training course aimed at Clean Development Mechanism aware- ness, knowledge and understanding for BOAD\u2019s key staff and management. The second component concerns the funding of a study on the scope for and feasibility of a carbon fund in the WAEMU, to be managed by BOAD.

In a first phase, this initiative focussed on smaller towns in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. A second phase for an additional 15 towns, involving Rwanda and Burundi as well, is currently being examined for potential fund- ing from the African Development Bank. The national governments have decided to scale up the initiative in a third phase, which will include a number of larger towns, such as Kisumu in Kenya, Mwanza in Tanzania and Kampala in Uganda, as well as Kigali in Rwanda and Gitega in Burundi, with emphasis on the low-income areas of these towns where the most urgent needs exist for improved water and sanitation services. Given the significant investment requirements of the projects under this third phase, it is planned to submit a series of requests to the ITF in the coming years, catering for the differences in the pace of preparation and imple- mentation in each of the participating countries. The first request was submitted to the ITF in 2010 for the Kampala Water and Sanitation Project and a TA grant operation for EUR 8m and an IRS grant operation for EUR 14m were approved in June 2010. The total project cost of the Kampala Water and Sani- tation Project is estimated at EUR 212m and will be financed through loans and grants from AFD, KfW and the EIB, as well as equity from the National Water and Sewerage Corporation. KfW, AFD and EIB are collabo- rating under the Mutual Reliance Initiative, with KfW as the Lead Financier, in keeping with one of the ITF\u2019s objectives, namely enhancing European co-financing. The IRS grant operation will be blended with AFD\u2019s own resources loan of EUR 64m in order to achieve terms compatible with the debt strategy of the Government of Uganda. The TA grant operation will fund the planning, an options study, project preparation and a hydraulic analysis with a view to developing an integrated master plan and improving knowledge of the impacts of waste water, climate changes and other variables. The use of grants or interest rate subsidies is justified by the strong pro-poor MDG focus and environmental character of the investments, providing best available technologies and disseminating them through water operator partnerships around Lake Victoria, and the need to safeguard the affordability of investments for the populations, as well as to accelerate investments and achieve terms of financing compatible with the obligations under each country\u2019s debt management strategy (HIPC or similar). Details of these elements are given below for the case of Kampala. The Lake Victoria WATSAN is a combination of physical investment projects and of capacity building measures to support viable and pro-poor water and sanitation services in the Lake Victoria Basin and is seen as a regional initiative helping to fast-track the implemen- tation of the Millennium Development Goals. This is entirely in line with the objectives of the ITF, which was set up under the EU-Africa Partnership for Infra- structure in response to the efforts undertaken by the international donor community to enhance develop- ment in Africa and the implementation of the Millen- nium Development Goals.

Environmental benefits \uf0ca Reduction of environmental effects of direct discharge of chemical sludge from water treatment. \uf0ca Contribution to environmental protection and reduced pollution of raw water in Lake Victoria. In addition to the anticipated technical, economic, social and environmental benefits, the project is expected to generate regional benefits that will have an impact on the wider Lake Victoria Basin region. These anticipated benefits will include i) improved health and livelihood of the population living around Lake Victoria, ii) improved water quality in the shared Lake Victoria resource, iii) augmentation of other efforts undertaken by the regional governments/institutions to conserve Lake Victoria as a shared water resource, and iv) close cooperation with the Lake Victoria Basin Commission in matters of moni- toring and development of the Lake Victoria resource during project implementation. Project financing The total cost of the KW-LVWatSan project is EUR 212m. The financing plan combines loan financing of EUR 75m from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), a loan of EUR 75m from the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Government of Uganda\u2019s (GoU) own contribution of EUR 34m, KfW grant financing of EUR 20m and a grant of EUR 8m from the EU-ITF provided through KfW. Concluding remarks The planning for this project was based on the 2010 feasibility report. However, due to the rather long process of mobilising project financing and the 5-year project implementation period, the original date of completion of 2025 will be extended to 2030-2035 during the detailed design phase to give adequate time for the next planning cycle for Kampala\u2019s water sup- ply infrastructure.

        "36 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Lower Orange River Hydropower Scheme (LOHEPS) Sector energy Type of grant TA Lead Financier EIB Estimated TPC EUR 250m TA grant amount EUR 1.6m Grant status approved The LOHEPS project consists of the development of up to nine small hydroelectric power stations, varying in size from 6 MW to 12 MW with an anticipated total installed capacity of 100 MW. Phase 1 covers four sites with a total capacity of 43 MW, and Phase 2 the remain- ing sites. The project is located on the Namibian side of the Orange River, which forms the border between Namibia and South Africa. The concept of the project is to divert the flow of the Orange River through canals and tunnels into a water turbine which in turn will drive an electric generator. By placing the turbines at stra- tegic points along the river, the kinetic and potential energy of the river is converted into electrical energy. The project is expected to be financed by the EIB, AFD, KfW and DBSA. The tunnelling costs constitute the largest share of the project cost and this may have a major impact, either positive or negative, on the project\u2019s financial viability. There currently remains some uncertainty with regard to tunnelling costs and the rate of execution, which this TA will address through geotechnical drilling and analysis. In addition the two project promoters, Nam- Power, Namibia\u2019s public power utility, and Clackson Power, a South African independent power producer, have also discussed in cooperation with the potential financiers what other studies and inputs are required for the future due diligence of the project. As a result and in addition to standard documents such as envi- ronmental impact assessments, it was found appro- priate to have the financial model audited, including an audit of hydrological data, given the non-recourse finance nature of the project, as well as to obtain a greater degree of certainty as to the methodology for the Clean Development Mechanism. Furthermore, a number of outstanding issues pertaining to water per- mits and licences were included in the scope of activi- ties to be supported in order to have a comprehensive project documentation package prepared. The largest and most critical of these project prepara- tion activities is the geological test drilling, as the proj- ect design is based on tunnels and canals, accounting for approximately 75% of the total project cost. This activity can considerably reduce construction risk as well as provide greatly improved cost estimates for the project.

        "37 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Engaging Banks in Energy Transition Projects Sector energy Type of grant TA Lead Financier AFD Estimated TPC EUR 60m Grant amount EUR 2m Grant status approved East Africa is faced with a growing energy demand cou- pled with intensive use of biomass fuel such as wood or charcoal. In Kenya, it represents 68% of the total primary energy requirements. In Uganda this figure reaches as much as 94% and in Tanzania 90%, bearing heavily on the countries\u2019 depleting natural resources. In parallel, forecasts for 2015 indicate that the share of fossil fuels in the consumption of the region\u2019s lead- ing economy, Kenya, will increase to 30% of primary energy demand compared to 23% in 2007, with oil meeting 29% of total needs. Such trends in the region will have a significant impact on the power bill and on the regional increase in petroleum product imports and prices. Combined with other trends, in particu- lar the region\u2019s urban population growth and rapid deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions are bound to rise sharply. Therefore, the region\u2019s transition pro- cess towards renewable energy sources is essential. Within this context, AFD is in the process of extend- ing environmental credit lines to local banks in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania for financing selected renew- able energy and energy efficiency investments. The objective is to provide additional means of diversifying energy resources in the East African region and thus help the region\u2019s transition towards renewable energy solutions that are technically, economically and finan- cially viable. The target investments are mainly proj- ects with a maximum cost of EUR 10m in the fields of hydroelectricity, biomass, biogas, solar and wind power. Other types of projects eligible for the AFD financing are energy-efficiency projects, mainly in the agribusiness sector. As a key supplement to these credit lines, AFD is cur- rently setting up a Regional Technical Assistance Pro- gramme aimed at assisting both the investors and the banks in the three countries involved. This programme will be organised as a regional platform, located in Nairobi, and will contribute to the development of capacities in the three countries through the transfer of skills to local experts and help the future develop- ment of renewable energy projects in the region. The local banks subscribing to the environmental credit lines will also benefit from the support provided by the Regional Technical Assistance Programme for the selec- tion and follow-up of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The TA grant operation will fund the general manage- ment expenses of the Regional Technical Assistance Programme as well as the development of and assis- tance to renewable energy projects, focusing exclu- sively on those investments with reasonable prospects of becoming connected to the electricity distribution grids of Kenya, Uganda or Tanzania.

The architecture of this satellite-based infrastructure will meet identified health sector requirements and will be able to provide telemedicine services tailored to the African context at an acceptable cost. The imple- mentation of such complex infrastructure will require the analysis of different aspects, not only from a purely technological angle based on the efficiency of oper- ational capabilities, but also in relation to the avail- ability of financial resources and system potentiality with respect to a certain degree of sustainability. This infrastructure will be capable of providing a variety of educational, clinical, surveillance and management services to Sub-Saharan citizens and health workers. Its goals are fully consistent with the strategic priori- ties of the socio-economic development of the Sub- Saharan region. Luxembourg Cooperation is geared towards poverty eradication, particularly in the least developed countries. Its efforts are consistent with the goal of sustainable development in its social, economic and environmental aspects \u2013 with men, women and children at its core. Luxembourg\u2019s develop- ment cooperation measures are aimed primarily at attaining the Millennium Development Goals. As a result, the main cooperation sectors are in the social sphere: health, education, including voca- tional training and apprenticeship, and integrated local development. Relevant initiatives in the area of microfinance are encouraged and supported, whether at the design stage or during operation. In addition to bilateral cooperation with a limited number of countries, the importance of a regional approach has grown over the last few years. The Government\u2019s action plan stipulates expressly that Luxembourg Cooperation must promote a regional approach where it is relevant and where it forms a vital complement to the bilateral approach. Due to its own (European) history, Luxembourg is in a good position to foster and support regional economic integration and to share lessons drawn from past experience. Since the adopted communication tools are central to a regional approach, it is essential to examine new information and com- munication technologies (ITC) in this context. Luxembourg has proven competence in these areas and it seems completely natu- ral to us to share this know-how with our partners. As a first step, Luxembourg Cooperation commissioned its executive agency Lux-Development to set up a technical assistance operation in the ITC sector for the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). Based on this initial regional experiment, Luxembourg Cooperation then took part in more ambitious projects aimed ultimately at benefiting the whole African continent. Given the size of our country and the financial resources at the disposal of Luxembourg Cooperation, it is evident that Luxembourg must act in partnership with and contribute to the activities of other finance providers, in particular the European Union. View from Luxembourg as a Donor of the ITF: Marie-Jos\u00e9e Jacobs, Minister for Development Cooperation and Humanitar- ian Assistance Through its contribution to the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund with other EU donors, the Luxembourg Government is supporting the AXIS African Internet Exchange System and the Satellite-Enhanced Telemedicine and eHealth for Sub-Saha- ran Africa Project.

One of the flagship projects of the ARAPKE is the African Internet Exchange System. Thanks to the support from the ITF and Lux-Development, the African Union Commis- sion will be able to implement the AXIS project by providing capacity building assis- tance to internet service provider associations and internet community stakeholders and supporting the establishment of internet exchange points, regional internet hubs and carriers, as well as continental internet carriers.

The ITF grant will be used for a number of activities related to the preparation and implementation of this project, in particular the financing of the establishment of a Project Implementation Unit to be located at the African Union Commission and the mobilisation of an Internet Service Provider Association Task Force. The Human Resources, Science and Technology Depart- ment of the African Union Commission will be the implementing partner of Lux-Development. The sign- ing of this agreement and the launch of the project are expected to take place in early 2011. The ITF grant will be used by Lux-Development to mandate the European Space Agency (ESA) to retain a consultant for the performance of preparatory tasks consisting mainly of four horizontal studies on issues related to governance, interoperability with existing legacy systems, compliance with regulations, etc. Fol- lowing this preparatory work, a series of user-driven telemedicine pre-operational services will be initialised in order to generate bottom-up dynamics, the ultimate goal of which will be the establishment of satellite- based infrastructure for the direct benefit of the Sub- Saharan population and relevant regional economy.

In this respect, the Tanzania Backbone is the key link for two major power pools in Southern and East Africa and should be operational by the end of 2013. The Tanzania Backbone project involves the construc- tion of a new 667 km high-voltage transmission line between Iringa and Shinyanga. This new line is part of the Tanzania Electricity Supply Company\u2019s (TANESCO) short-term strategy for national grid transmission line reinforcement. In addition, it will be a key component of regional economic cooperation and development as it will facilitate the power system interconnection with Kenya in the north and Zambia in the south. The total project cost is estimated at EUR 382.9m, co-financed by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, JICA, the Korean EDCF and the EIB, with the balance financed by the Republic of Tanzania.

Umojanet (the \u201cnet of togetherness\u201d) is the terrestrial mesh network. Uhurunet (the \u201cnet of freedom\u201d) is the submarine ring network. Umojanet and Uhurunet are to be interconnected with each other and with the international network. The aim of Umojanet is to develop, reinforce, structure and operate regional broadband infrastructure, mainly through the laying of new buried or aerial cross-border fibre-optic cables or through the purchase/lease of capacity on existing ones. The Umojanet Project includes two phases. The first phase looked at the development of the terrestrial broadband network in Southern and Eastern Africa. Based on detailed feasibility studies, conducted in 2009, investors are now finalising the fundraising pro- cess in order to start the rollout of Umojanet in East- ern and Southern Africa and complete it by end-2012. The NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA) identified the strong need to carry out a feasibility study in order to assess the technical, economic and commercial feasibility of the planned project in the Western, Central and Northern African regions and form the basis for requesting the participation of inves- tors and other financiers in the financing of the project. The TA grant from the Trust Fund will be used to fund a study which will include a detailed technical and commercial feasibility assessment, a complete net- work design and a business plan for each region (West, Central and North Africa). It will in particular identify existing fibre-optic broadband infrastructure in the 29 countries concerned and the gaps along the pro- posed routes. It will also examine in detail the traffic flow in the network and estimate the cost of setting up the project, comprising the construction of new cable infrastructure, leasing capacity on existing fibre, equip- ping nodal points in each country, etc. The manage- ment of the resulting network is furthermore included in the scope of the technical assistance. Based on all these inputs, the study will propose an optimum network in terms of network economics, con- figuration and costs, with a clear definition of interface mechanisms with neighbouring networks. This operation will help bridge the digital divide by contributing to accelerating the development of Afri- can inter-country regional and global connectivity and encourage economic growth through broader access to information, services and education. Such large and long-term infrastructure projects require massive investment and detailed and thorough planning, and can only be implemented on the basis of complete feasibility studies.

The Project would contribute to improving access to reliable power in Eastern Africa by adding 300 MW of base load generation capacity to the East African power system. Geothermal power production is a least or low-cost solution at many sites in Eastern Africa, once the initial risks and cost of exploration and confirma- tion drilling have been assessed. The successful geo- thermal power plants in Kenya, which have been in operation for more than 30 years with a load factor of around 90%, are proof of sustainability. The planned projects are currently in early development phases and will have high development costs and require large capital investment. The direct grant would be used to support the cost of drilling and to assist developers in securing finance for subsequent exploration or appraisal wells and surface studies to determine the optimal location of explo- ration. It is expected that the grant contribution will encourage public and private investors to develop geo- thermal prospects for power generation and ultimately help increase access to affordable, reliable and almost emission-free power, thus improving living conditions and the quality of socio-economic development in the region. In addition, geothermal power plants operate independently of weather conditions and thus improve adaptation to climate change. ",

        "47 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Grant Operations Completed As described earlier, Trust Fund grant operations can take several forms, i.e. interest rate subsidies, technical assistance, direct grants and insurance premia. Each of them is expected to lead to an investment, in the short or medium term, depending on what the grant is fund- ing and how much time is required to \u201ccomplete\u201d the grant operation, which can vary greatly. In cases where the grant provides funding for some of the new assets of a project or it reduces the amount of debt service of a borrower, the grant operation will be considered \u201ccompleted\u201d only after all physical assets are in place and the project has become fully opera- tional. The timing of the \u201ccompletion date\u201d of a project is usually included in the project\u2019s technical descrip- tion annexed to the finance contract between the promoter(s) and the financiers. In addition, it is only one or two years after the project has become opera- tional that a \u201cProject Completion Report\u201d becomes due. Hence, the interval between the approval of a grant operation in support of an investment and its comple- tion date or report can add up to several years, as can easily be imagined for the construction of a new hydro- power plant or the rehabilitation of a port or airport. If the grant provides funding for advisory services or technical assistance, the grant operation will be con- sidered \u201ccompleted\u201d once the grant has been fully dis- bursed and after both the client and the contracting authority have agreed that all tasks which were to be performed in accordance with the Terms of Reference have indeed been accomplished.

        "49 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund The Caprivi Interconnection Line \u2013 some technical features: The project consisted of the construction of a 300 MW HVDC 5 transmission connection, with a total length of 950 km, interconnecting the northern and western parts of the SAPP 6 net- work. The line starts from Katima Mulilo, in the north-eastern tip of Namibia, continuing along the Caprivi Strip, a narrow 400 km long sec- tion of Namibia in the north-east of the coun- try between Zambia and Botswana, and ends in Gerus, in central Namibia. It reinforces the elec- tricity transmission interconnection between Zambia, Namibia and South Africa and pro- vides a reliable route for electricity exports and imports. It supports a competitive regional power market and improves the security of power supply. The project was completed in October 2010, a few months behind schedule. Power purchase agreements for a firm 5-year power-offtake were signed with Zimbabwe Elec- tricity Transmission Company (ZETCO) in 2007 and with Zambia\u2019s ZESCO and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale d\u2019\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (SNEL), the national electricity com- pany of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 2009. 5 High Voltage Direct Current. 6 The Southern African Power Pool. The 300 MW high voltage interconnector was officially inaugurated on 12 November 2010 by the Presidents of Namibia, Zambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.

        "50 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Cooperation founded on an EU-Africa partnership approach Launched in 1994 with the first exchange of staff, cooperation between AFD and KfW takes the form of joint activities in Africa with a firm base in Europe. After four years of staff exchanges, AFD-KfW cooperation was reinforced by joint operations, viable for both institutions. Given the need for financing in Africa, the joint activities naturally began in this part of the world, including, in particular, the first examples of management delegation between bilateral lenders in Benin (AFD to KfW) and Mali (KfW to AFD) and of loan co-financing in Cameroon (docks in the Port of Douala) and Kenya (roads). The opening of a representative office within the European institutions by KfW in 1995, joined by AFD in 2002, is fully in line with this approach. This joint office has gradually contributed to raising the EU stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the reality of the bilateral aid operators, their expertise, their uniqueness and their differences. The common goals can be summarised in three main points: \uf0ca to establish a relationship of lasting cooperation and operational collaboration between KfW, AFD and the EU institutions (Commission, Parliament, EIB); \uf0ca to contribute to the construction of an operational network of European aid providers with the Commission and other bilat- eral institutions; \uf0ca to develop and optimise the valued added of KfW and AFD within the framework of EU development cooperation. The creation of the Trust Fund for African infrastructure in April 2007 and, more generally, the adoption of loan and grant blend- ing provided the two institutions with an opportunity to (i) take a step forward in the financing of backbone infrastructure with a regional dimension in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (ii) make a substantial contribution to the implementation of the code of con- duct adopted under the German Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The EASSy fibre-optic cable (in 2007), the Caprivi transmission line (in 2008) and the Lake Victoria Water and Sanitation project (in 2010) are but a few examples of major financing operations that meet the requirements of our African partners by constitut- ing a financial force that cannot be deployed by one institution alone. The mutual reliance initiative, which enables each individual institution to appraise a project or programme on behalf of all three (the EIB is involved in this process), is a practical response to the coordination requirements set out by the code of conduct and, more generally, by the regulatory framework for aid effectiveness.

        "51 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund The ITF pipeline will thus be considerably enhanced compared to earlier years. Over a dozen projects gener- ating grant requests for about EUR 100m have already been identified for submission in 2011. The most dominant sectors for grant requests in 2011 are expected to be transport and energy. As this latter sector represents over 70% of the infrastructure fund- ing gap in Africa according to the African Development Bank, the Trust Fund should provide welcome assis- tance in line with the priority needs of Africa. It is also estimated that more than half of the pipeline projects will receive interest rate subsidy support under the HIPC debt-sustainability framework, illustrating again the catalytic role of the ITF in fostering invest- ments that would otherwise not materialise. As recommended by the authorities overseeing the Trust Fund in both the European Union and the African Union, closer cooperation will also be sought with the private sector in order to explore investment opportu- nities, using innovative approaches to financing, made possible by the blending of grants from donors with long-term financing from financial institutions, no tably to mitigate specific types of risks. Outlook for 2011 The Project Financiers Group, which is responsible for submitting grant operation requests that bene- fit from Trust Fund support, was strengthened with the membership in late 2010 of three new finan- ciers, i.e. the African Development Bank, Finnfund and the Private Infrastructure Development Group.

The total project costs are estimated at EUR 188.5m and the project is being co-financed by loans from the EIB, the World Bank\u2019s IDA, Beira Railway Company (Compan- hia dos Caminhos de Ferro da Beira), Mozambique Ports and Railways (Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de Mo\u00e7am- bique) and the Danish Development Agency (Danida) and by a grant from the Netherlands through ORET. The Benin - Togo Power Rehabilitation Sector energy Type of grant IRS Grant amount up to EUR 12.25m Status awaiting first disbursement Lead Financier EIB The project is aimed at refurbishing and extending the transmission networks of Togo and Benin and will enable the promoter to substantially improve the reliability of supply, to reduce the use of low-efficiency local gener- ators and to decrease network losses. In terms of new assets, the project includes 308 km of 161 kV lines, 5 km of 63 kV underground cables and one substation. It also includes the refurbishment of 290 km of 161 kV lines and the refurbishment/enlargement of eight substations. The total project cost is estimated to be EUR 73.2m and will be co-financed by the EIB, the World Bank, the German KfW and the project promoter, Communaut\u00e9 Electrique du B\u00e9nin (CEB). The repair of the existing transmission lines will help prevent major power sup- ply disruptions. The new lines will extend the reach and quality of the transmission infrastructure in the benefi- ciary countries, improving the reliability and efficiency of electricity supply and creating a better environment for private sector investment and growth. The ITF grant will be used by the EIB to subsidise the interest rate of its EUR 35m loan to CEB. As HIPC coun- tries, both Benin and Togo are restricted in terms of the financing costs they can bear for their respective public sector investments; the ITF grant is therefore of great importance. IRS grant is used by the EIB to subsidise the interest rate of its loans to the two project components, rail and port. The port dredging work started in summer 2010 and the implementation of the project is progressing accord- ing to schedule. This part of the project is expected to be completed on time, i.e. by end-June 2011. As the implementation of the railway rehabilitation work was delayed by 12 months, the completion of this compo- nent is now expected during the second quarter of 2011. The EIB has made two disbursements under the port component and is expecting to disburse a further EUR 7m in April 2011. Two further disbursements have been made under the rail component. The relevant portions of the ITF grant have been transferred from the ITF to the EIB for subsidising the interest rate applicable to the four 2010 disbursements. ",

The project is co-financed by the EIB, the World Bank\u2019s IDA and OMVS. The ITF grant operation is being used by the EIB to ren- der its loans to the three States involved in the project compliant with HIPC conditions. The resulting interest differential, paid by SOGEM and the EIB\u2019s borrowers, the Republics of Mauritania, Mali and Senegal, will be used for a rural electrification programme. In November 2010, IDA in agreement with the EIB made the down payment to the contractor Sinhydro to allow for the preparation of works. A first disbursement was made under the EIB loan agreements, followed by the first transfer of the corresponding subsidy portion from the ITF to the EIB. Port Autonome de Pointe Noire Sector transport Type of first grant IRS Grant amount up to EUR 6.6m Status awaiting first disbursement Type of second grant TA Grant amount up to EUR 2m Status awaiting first disbursement Lead Financier AFD The project concerns the renovation and upgrad- ing of the main infrastructure in the Port Autonome de Pointe Noire (PAPN) in the Republic of the Congo and its adaptation to developments in container- ised traffic. It entails the construction of a protective berm and the extension of the external breakwater by 300 m, the rehabilitation and extension of quays, dredging work, the purchase of two seagoing tugs and the repair and upgrading of others. The capacity of the new container terminal will be approximately 1 million \u201cTwenty-Foot Equivalent Unit\u201d (TEU) con- tainers per annum, compared to a previous capacity of only 300 000 TEU per annum. The total project cost is estimated at EUR 128.4m and will be financed by the long-term loans from the EIB, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement and Banque de D\u00e9veloppement des \u00c9tats de l\u2019Afrique Centrale (BDEAC) and through self-financing by PAPN. The interest subsidy from the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund will be used by AFD to enhance the conces- sionality of its loan. The technical assistance grant will be used to finance capacity building for the financial and accounting staff of PAPN, including the upgrading of accounting information systems, improvements to internal control procedures, maintenance of the financial projection model and assistance to the financial manage- ment. These measures will help to improve the manage- ment of the Port Authority and decrease the credit risk for the Port\u2019s lenders. In addition, the Port Authority needs external support for implementing an environmental management plan for the day-to-day operation period. ",
        "54 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Jomo Kenyatta International Airport Extension (JKIA) Sector transport Type of grant TA Grant amount up to EUR 5m Status under disbursement Lead Financier EIB The project comprises the upgrading and rehabilita- tion of the passenger terminal facilities at JKIA, Kenya\u2019s main airport. The aviation sector in Kenya has enjoyed significant growth in the recent past, both in tourism and cargo transport, which is expected to continue. Kenya Airways, the national carrier, has the largest route network in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the civil aviation infrastructure has not kept pace with the qual- ity of the air transport services. The current airport was originally designed for an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers and presently handles almost double that volume, leading to difficulties in meeting international customer service standards. The proposed project will increase the design capacity to 9.3 million passengers a year and improve security in order to comply with International Civil Aviation Authority standards. Due to the complexity of the project, as well as poten- tial environmental issues, a number of areas will greatly benefit from the technical assistance and capacity building which will be financed by the ITF grant. Areas to be addressed in the framework of this technical assis- tance are support for the project management to mini- mise the impact on existing operations and to ensure proper monitoring of the project, including financial monitoring, the measurement and monitoring of air pollutants, the assessment of aviation activities on wildlife and natural habitats and assistance in imple- menting environmental management systems. For this purpose, a service contract was signed with EGIS AVIA/EGIS BECEOM International in September 2010. WAPP Coastal Backbone Sector energy Type of grant TA Grant amount up to EUR 1.75m Status under disbursement Lead Financier EIB One of the key projects related to WAPP\u2019s aim to develop a regional electricity market in West Africa is the 330 kV interconnection line between Riviera in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Prestea in Ghana. For the planning of this project, the ITF grant was made available to WAPP to fund a project preparation package comprising a contract for a technical, economic and financial fea- sibility study of the project, a second contract for the line route study, the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, the Resettlement Action Plan and the Environmental and Social Management Plan for the project and, as a third element, an audit of these two contracts. After the signature of a framework agree- ment between the EIB and the WAPP for this package in June 2009, WAPP put out to tender and signed, in August 2010, a contract with Lahmeyer International GmbH for the feasibility study and a contract with a joint venture of ANTEA, ENVAL, Monbailliu & Asso- ci\u00e9s, Moses Consulting and TTI Production for the line route and ESIA study.

WAPP CLSG - Pre-Investment Studies for West Africa Power Interconnection Sector energy Type of grant TA Grant amount up to EUR 3m Grant status under disbursement Lead Financier EIB The power interconnection between C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea (CLSG), allowing power exchanges between the four countries, is a pri- ority project of the West African Power Pool (WAPP). The project will consist of the construction of approx- imately 1 100 km of high-voltage transmission lines, as well as the extension of existing or the construc- tion of new high-voltage substations in Man (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire); Sannequille, Buchanan and Monrovia (Libe- ria); Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kore and Linsan (Guinea); and Bumbuna (Sierra Leone). For the preparation of this project an ITF grant of up to EUR 3m was made available, via the EIB, to WAPP for the financing of a feasibility study, conducted by a joint venture between Application Europ\u00e9enne de Technologies et de Services and SOGREAH Consult- ants, and of a line route and environmental and social impact assessment study, conducted by Korea Electric Power Corporation. The two studies are expected to be finalised during the third quarter of 2011. The EIB plans to request a second TA grant operation from the Trust Fund in 2011 for the financing of the owner\u2019s engineer until the award of the engineering, procurement and construction contracts for the pro- ject, to ensure the smooth continuation of the project preparation progress, bearing in mind that the prepa- ration of such a complex regional project is a lengthy process.

        "56 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund ECOWAS Electricity Regulation Sector energy Type of grant TA Grant amount up to EUR 1.7m Status under disbursement Lead Financier AFD The ECOWAS Energy Protocol, adopted in 2003, is aimed at increasing investments in the energy sec- tor and energy trade in the West Africa Region. In line with this objective, ECOWAS has set up a regional regu- latory authority. ECOWAS received a EUR 5m grant from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement to define the tasks of this authority, now known as ERERA, and to help fund its first years of operation. ERERA\u2019s initial regulatory activities comprise the regional benchmark- ing of the electricity sector, assistance to the Senegal River Basin Commission and the Gambia River Basin Commission for improving cross-border exchanges and support for the national regulators for setting inter- national exchange tariffs. ERERA will also facilitate the settlement of disputes relating to cross-border power exchange. In addition, ERERA\u2019s activities are focused on fostering the creation of a competitive regional market by enhancing regional power policy, planning and technical regulation and on regional integration in the energy sector. To this effect, it targets the secured development of cross-border exchanges, the promo- tion of competitiveness in the emerging regional elec- tricity market, a better exchange of information and building up the trust of investors in the energy sector. The ITF grant complements the above-mentioned AFD grant and will be made available and used by the ECO- WAS Regional Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERERA) to implement its activities. The official launch of ERERA took place on 9 November 2010, followed by the sig- nature of a financing agreement between AFD and ERERA, defining the use of the ITF grant. Over the years, the contributions from AFD and the Infrastructure Trust Fund will fall and the contributions from the industry operators will gradually increase, enabling ERERA to operate in a sustainable manner. ERERA will therefore exist for and via the industry. \u201cThe regional power grid interconnection or electricity gener- ation projects cannot come to fruition unless there is a clear legal, tariff and contractual framework. This is particularly true if the private sector is to be involved, which is essential given the amount of investment required.\u201d \u201cFor that reason AFD decided to support ECOWAS\u2019s plan to set up a regional regulatory authority and to help fund the early years of ERERA\u2019s operation. ERERA will also receive a EUR 1.7m contribution from the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund, which is backed by the European Commission and a dozen or so European states. I am also pleased to announce that, on behalf of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund, AFD will be signing the financing agreement for this EU grant, to coincide with this forum. These grants come on top of the annual contributions granted by the ECOWAS Commission.\u201d Opening address by Bruno Leclerc, Head of AFD\u2019s Accra Office, at the Regulators\u2019 forum on 09/11/2010 ",

        "64 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 1. General information Under the umbrella of the EU Strategy for Africa, the Euro- pean Commission and nine EU Member States (\u201cthe Con- tributors\u201d) as well as the European Investment Bank (\u201cEIB\u201d) as Manager of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (ITF) (\u201cthe Trust Fund\u201d or \u201cthe ITF\u201d), signed the Agreement consti- tuting the Implementation Rules of the Trust Fund (\u201cthe Rules\u201d). Since then, three further Member States have be- come Contributors of the Trust Fund. A first amendment to the Rules was approved by the Trust Fund\u2019s Executive Com- mittee on 29 June 2009; and a second amendment on 25 November 2010. The key objective of the ITF is to contribute to achieving the strategic objectives of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Partner- ship through blending of targeted long-term financing of eligible regional infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Af- rica with grant money from Contributor Member States. The Trust Fund has a limited lifespan and can be wound-up once certain events occur. Article 11.2.1 (d) of the Rules in- cludes the possibility to wind-up the Trust Fund on 31 De- cember 2015 and article 11.3 specifies the modalities of disposal of the remaining resources. The Board of Directors of EIB adopted the financial state- ments on 10 March 2011 and authorised their submission to the Board of Governors for approval at their meeting on 17 May 2011. 2. Significant accounting policies 2.1. Basis of preparation- Statement of compliance The Trust Fund\u2019s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS). 2.2. Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting esti- mates. It also requires EIB Management to exercise its judg- ment in the process of applying the Trust Fund\u2019s accounting policies. Notes to the financial statements 2.3. Changes in accounting policies The applicable accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2011 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The Trust Fund plans to adopt these standards and Amend- ments at their effective dates and does not anticipate any significant impacts on its financial state- ments. 2.4. Summary of significant accounting policies 2.4.1 Foreign currency translation The Trust Fund uses the Euro (EUR) for presenting its financial statements, which is also its functional currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than Euro are translated into Euro at the exchange rate prevailing at the statement of financial position\u2019s date. The gain or loss arising from such translation is recorded in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are trans- lated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of transac- tions at rates different from those at the date of the transac- tion, and unrealised foreign exchange differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. The elements of the statement of comprehensive income are translated into Euro on the basis of the exchange rates pre- vailing at the end of each month. ",
        "65 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 2.4.2 Cash and cash equivalents The Trust Fund defines cash and cash equivalents as current accounts and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. The current account is one account opened in the EIB books in the name of the Trust Fund, called \u201cEU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Account\u201d. 2.4.3 Contributions In addition to the Founding Donor (the European Commis- sion), any Member State of the European Union or any Mem- ber State Development Finance Agency may contribute funds in Euro to the Trust Fund. Contributions, net of banking charges, are recognised in the statement of financial position on the date when payment of a contribution by a contributor is received. The Fund\u2019s contributions meet the following conditions and are consequently classified as equity: \u2022 As defined in the contribution agreement, they entitle the Contributors to decide on the utilisation of the Fund\u2019s net assets in the events of the Fund\u2019s liquidation; \u2022 They are in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments; \u2022 All financial instruments in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments have identi- cal features; \u2022 The instrument does not include any features that would require classification as a liability; and \u2022 The total expected cash flows attributable to the instrument over its life are based substantially on the profit or loss, the change in the recognised net assets or the change in the fair value of the recognised and unrecognised net assets of the Fund over the life of the instrument. 2.4.4 Disbursements for operations Disbursements related to operations financed by the Trust Fund are recorded as expenditures in the statement of com- prehensive income as \u201cProjects Financed\u201d at the date they are paid out by the Trust Fund. 2.4.5 General administrative expenses For managing the Trust Fund the EIB is granted a one-off pay- ment equal to 4% (four percent) to be deducted from each contribution effectively made available to the Trust Fund. The administrative fee is intended to cover in full the costs associ- ated with managing the Trust Fund. General administrative expenses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a pro-rata basis over the remaining lifespan of the Trust Fund. 2.4.6 Taxation The Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the Euro- pean Communities, appended to the Treaty of 8 April 1965 establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities, stipulates that the assets, revenues and other property of the Institutions of the Union are ex- empt from all direct taxes.

Luxembourg B 103590 Capital 25 000 \u20ac Emmanuel Doll\u00e9 We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2010 and the statements of comprehensive income, changes in con- tributors\u2019 resources and cash flow for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other ex- planatory information. EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK Management\u2019s respon- sibility for the financial statements The EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK\u2019s Management is respon- sible for the preparation and fair presentation of these finan- cial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK\u2019s Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from mate- rial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Responsibility of the R\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveil- lance du Secteur Financier. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the judge- ment of the R\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9, including the as- sessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In mak- ing those risk assessments, the R\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 considers internal control relevant to the entity\u2019s prepara- tion and fair presentation of the financial statements in or- der to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of ac- counting estimates made by the EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK\u2019s Management, as well as evaluating the overall pres- entation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf- ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opin- ion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund as of 31 December 2010, and of its financial per- formance and its cash flows for the year then ended in ac- cordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

        "76 Annual Report 2010 EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund The Regional Economic Communities (RECs), which were established with the aim of promoting greater eco- nomic integration of the African countries, work closely with the African Union and its Commission to facilitate the harmonisation of policies and the formulation and implementation of all African Union programmes.
