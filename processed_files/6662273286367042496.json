        "I Financing Global Sustainable Development: Illustrations of EU contributions to the 2030 Agenda ",
        "Financing Global Sustainable Development: Illustrations of EU contributions to the 2030 Agenda The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, agreed at the third United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015, sets out a vision of how development financing should evolve to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals. It provides a broad, coherent framework for bringing together a fuller range of mutually reinforcing means of implementation and for mobilising support from a broader range of actors. Since July 2015, the European Union (EU) and its Member States have undertaken a series of important commitments to support this agenda. One year on from the Addis Ababa Conference, it is timely to reflect on what progress the EU and its Member States have made against these commitments. This document reflects the broad EU approach to financing sustainable development and poverty eradication 1 It is divided into two parts. The first, an overview of the holistic, inclusive and modernised approach of the EU and its Member States, is focused on three pillars: (i) support for harnessing domestic resources; (ii) investments; and (iii) international public finance, including official development assistance (ODA). The second part of the document contains selected illustrations of the contributions of the EU and its Member States in key thematic sectors, including measures targeted on the least developed countries (LDCs), reflecting the EU\u2019s focus on those most in need. The second part also highlights the main achievements that have taken place since the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in July 2015. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda, which describes the means of implementation needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It is only by bringing together the means and the ends that we can successfully implement this ambitious agenda. Implementation must be driven by a new global partnership, one based on the principles of universality, shared responsibility, mutual accountability, consideration of respective capabilities and a multi-stakeholder approach. The EU and its Member States are committed to supporting this new global partnership and playing their part in full for the implementation of the new global development agenda. 1 This document is for communication purposes only and does not entail new EU commitments.

        "2 (cid:2)(cid:3) In October 2015, the \u2018 Collect More, Spend Better \u2019 approach was adopted; it is based on the principles set out in the 2030 Agenda, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. It is a holistic strategy that addresses both the revenue and expenditure side of domestic public finance. This EU approach is based on the two guiding principles of \u2018Leading by Example\u2019 and \u2018Global Partnerships\u2019. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU, a signatory member of the Addis Tax Initiative and member of its steering group, is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the initiative. This includes contributing to a doubling of support to strengthen domestic resource mobilisation in devel- oping countries and to establish efficient, effective, transparent and fair tax systems. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is investing EUR 42 million in a flagship pro- gramme of domestic resource mobilisation to boost developing countries\u2019 generation of domestic reve- nue and tackle tax evasion, tax avoidance and illicit financial flows. A number of initiatives are already under preparation, such as the continued support to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and assistance to the UN Tax Committee by supporting the participation of developing countries in the rel- evant sub-committees. (cid:2)(cid:3) EU budget support programmes will continue to enhance developing countries\u2019 public financial man- agement, including domestic revenue mobilisation. As of January 2016, the EU had ongoing budget sup- port commitments of EUR 12.76 billion through 271 operations in 91 countries. 1. The EU is helping countries to mobilise more domestic resources, improve public finance management and ensure debt sustainability (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU provides an average of EUR 140 million annu- ally to support domestic public finance in developing countries. (cid:2)(cid:3) All EU Member States have ratified the UN Conven- tion against Corruption. (cid:2)(cid:3) To fight against corporate tax avoidance and harmful tax competition, in June 2016 the EU agreed on new rules to fight corporate tax avoidance as part of its Anti-Tax Avoidance Package. The package included tax-transparency measures to facilitate the auto- matic exchange of information between the tax authorities of Member States in line with the G20/ OECD Base Erosion Profit Shifting package. (cid:2)(cid:3) The proposed amendment to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation includes a requirement for \u2018country-by-country\u2019 reporting, obliging transna- tional corporations, in their tax declarations, to sup- ply country details that presently are not available. (cid:2)(cid:3) In May 2015, the EU adopted a Directive on the pre- vention of the use of the financial system for the pur- poses of money laundering and terrorist financing. Its provisions will be transposed into national legisla- tion by June 2017. Under the directive, EU Member States will establish a public register identifying the ultimate beneficial owners of companies and trusts. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU established the Platform for Tax Good Gov- ernance, Aggressive Tax Planning and Double Taxa- tion to promote good governance in tax matters in third countries. A h o l i s t i c a p p r o a c h t o s u s t a i n a b l e d e v ",
        "3 v e l o p m e n t f i n a n c e The Addis Tax Initiative, launched by, amongst others, the EU, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden during the Third Financing for Development Conference, has gained the support of 31 countries and 8 international organisations. The Initia- tive\u2019s key commitment is the doubling of capacity build- ing efforts in developing countries to increase domestic revenue mobilisation. Austria, Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands and Spain are supporting developing partners to strengthen their tax systems against tax evasion and tax avoidance. Their support includes funding to enable the OECD to assist developing country tax authorities in better administer- ing multinational transfer-pricing practices. Such assis- tance has enabled Kenya\u2019s revenue authority to raise over EUR 12 million in additional tax revenue. In 2015, Denmark also launched a new implementation plan for its engagement in tax and development with support for new and ongoing activities in the range of EUR 74 mil- lion. Austria supports the anti-corruption efforts of independ- ent audit institutions (notably through the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions) and the improvement of public accounting systems through training, research and exchange of best practices in fighting corruption. Poland is committed to supporting developing countries in combating illicit financial flows; this will be one of the thematic priorities of its development policy for 2016- 2020. Slovenia supports capacity development for the public financial management systems of partner countries. To strengthen domestic revenue mobilisation in devel- oping countries, the Netherlands will not request tax exemptions when delivering goods and services paid for with government-to-government aid. The policy will apply to all new programmes starting from January 2016. Ireland has introduced legislation to provide for country- by-country reporting by multinationals, thus increasing transparency about the global allocation of income, eco- nomic activity and taxes paid in each country in line with the approach agreed under the Organisation for Eco- nomic Co-operation Development (OECD) project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. The UK government held an international anti-corrup- tion summit in London in May 2016. The event focused on the international actions needed to tackle illicit flows and meet the following objectives: deterring corruption, ending impunity for those who commit corruption, and supporting and empowering those who have suffered from corruption.

        "4 2 Members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Blending (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is at the forefront of efforts to develop innova- tive approaches to financing development. From the creation of the first EU Facilities in 2007, more than EUR 2.7 billion of EU grants have leveraged almost EUR 23 billion of loans with a total investment vol- ume in partner countries of more than EUR 50 billion. (cid:2)(cid:3) In 2015, a new EU instrument for blending, the Afri- can Investment Facility, was set up with an indicative pipeline of 148 projects. The Facility\u2019s total envisaged grant amount of around EUR 2 billion will contribute to projects having a total investment cost of more than EUR 25 billion. (cid:2)(cid:3) Building on existing initiatives, a new External Invest- ment Plan will be put in place in order to mobilise especially private investments in Africa and Neigh- bourhood region. EUR 3.1 billion will be mobilised to this end, including through EU facilities, expected to trigger total investments of up to EUR 31 billion and the potential to increase to EUR 62 billion if other partners match the EU contribution. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU, working together with partner countries, will invest in more than 500 new projects in key sectors such as sustainable energy, transport, infrastructure, water and sanitation, sustainable agriculture, and sup- port for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Private sector (cid:2)(cid:3) Through its geographic and thematic programmes, the EU will invest over EUR 2 billion by 2020 to sup- port local private sector development and facilitate responsible and inclusive private sector investment in development. Outside the EU, support for SMEs from the European Investment Bank (EIB) amounted to roughly EUR 2.5 billion per year over the period 2013-2015 (through all available instruments). More than 5 500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) employing over 250 000 people benefited. (cid:2)(cid:3) EU action focuses on promoting an enabling busi- ness environment, responsible business practices (extending to practices in global supply chains and in specific sectors, such as garments), and private- sector engagement. The EU will step up support to micro-enterprises and SMEs, and will increase access to finance for youth, women, and rural populations. (cid:2)(cid:3) To further encourage inclusive public-private policy dialogue in partner countries, EU Business Fora have recently been created in countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania. In Senegal, a new memorandum of understanding between European investors and the EU promotes the development of the local private sector, reinforcing its linkages with European enterprises and investors. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EIB is investing in high-risk private sector projects that promise substantial social and environmental outcomes through an Impact Financing Envelope valued at EUR 500 million. The Dutch Good Growth Fund (DGGF) provides EUR 700 million to SMEs and entrepreneurs in 68 emerging mar- kets and developing countries. It has mobilised three to five times as much private capital as the amount invested and has already helped create 12 000 new jobs in low- and middle-income countries. The Czech Republic will continue to encourage private sector involvement in development cooperation through business-to-business programmes and by building synergies between the public, private and non- governmental sectors in partner countries. Finland will increase by EUR 100 million annually its con- tribution to support and leverage sustainable develop- ment goals through equity and other investments, with an emphasis on poor countries. Mechanisms such as geothermal risk mitigation facilities for East Africa and Latin America are designed to encour- age public and private investors and public private part- nerships: with grants of nearly EUR 100 million from the EU, France, Germany, the UK and other donors, up to EUR 2 billion total investments could be generated. To leverage funding from local and international part- ners, Spain has set up two funds \u2013 the Sustainable Devel- opment Goals Fund (with EUR 52 million, which will finance programmes in 18 countries initially) and the Fund for Cooperation on Water and Sanitation. As of 2016, the Italian Cassa Depositi e Prestiti operates as the Italian development Bank with an increased focus on private sector partnerships and private sector devel- opment in partner countries. The new institution will leverage a wide array of financial instruments to increase the impact of its development cooperation resources. The Netherlands and Sweden back \u2018Convergence\u2019, a plat- form to support new and early-stage blended financing opportunities through strategic use of capital from pub- lic institutions. The goal is to rapidly unlock and leverage private sector investments into deals that support devel- opment outcomes. Luxembourg launched a new Business Partnership Facil- ity that will encourage European companies to create sustainable partnerships with SMEs in developing coun- tries, thereby facilitating the transfer of investment, tech- nology and, most important, skills. 2. The EU is leveraging more development funding through blending and seeking further partnerships with the private sector ",
        "5 Following the adoption of Italy\u2019s Development Coopera- tion Reform Law (125/2014), the country\u2019s additional allocations to ODA will triple for the next three years (additional amounts of EUR 120 million for 2016, EUR 240 million for 2017, EUR 360 million for 2018). Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark and the UK continue to live up to the UN commitment of providing 0.70 % of GNI in ODA. During the UN Sustainable Development Summit in Sep- tember 2015, France announced an increase of EUR 4 billion to its sustainable development finance by 2020. 3. The EU and its Member States continue to be the world\u2019s largest provider of ODA (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU collectively provides more ODA than all other donors 2 combined, having disbursed almost EUR 68 billion in 2015, an increase of 15 % from 2014. The EU is committed to achieving the UN 0.70 % ODA/GNI target within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda. (cid:2)(cid:3) ODA remains an important source of financing for many developing countries, especially those most in need. The EU has undertaken a collective commit- ment to reach 0.15-0.20 % ODA/GNI to LDCs in the short term, and to reach 0.20 % ODA/GNI to LDCs within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is determined to continue progress towards its development effectiveness and transparency commitments, further strengthening the quality, impact and accountability of its spending. ",
        "6 4. Environment and climate \u2014 The EU leads the efforts for a sustainable world (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU has committed to spend at least 20 % of its budget for 2014-2020 on action related to climate change. This means that, by 2020, at least EUR 14 bil- lion of public grants (an average of EUR 2 billion per year) will have supported activities in developing countries. In addition to funding managed by the European Commission, the EIB is one of the world\u2019s largest providers of climate finance with about EUR 2.2 billion per year allocated to climate-related pro- jects in developing countries. The EIB has adopted a new strategy to guide its climate finance setting a target to exceed 25 % of all EIB lending in support of climate mitigation and adaptation. By 2020, the EIB intends to increase the share of Climate Action finance to 35 % of its overall investments in develop- ing countries. (cid:2)(cid:3) Under thematic programmes dealing specifically with environment and climate change in developing countries the EU will have invested around EUR 1.3 billion for the period 2014-2020, for example, EUR 81 million for water and over EUR 230 million for forests. (cid:2)(cid:3) Over the same period, the EU will have provided up to EUR 1 billion for biodiversity and ecosystems, including wildlife conservation in both developed and developing countries. (cid:2)(cid:3) In late 2015 a new phase of the Global Climate Change Alliance was announced, with a projected commitment of around EUR 350 million until 2020 in addition to the private and national public invest- ments that this financial support is expected to lever- age. The alliance mainly supports LDCs and small island developing states in adapting to the impacts of climate change and integrating climate change resilience into their development planning and implementation. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU also supports regional climate programmes and, for instance, over the period 2014-2020 plans to allocate EUR 300 million to the Latin America region. In early 2016 an amount of EUR 40 million was com- mitted to the EUROCLIMA+ programme to contrib- ute to the environmentally sustainable and more climate-resilient development of Latin America and to support countries in that region in implementing the commitments made in the framework of the Paris Agreement. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU shares experiences, runs strategic dialogues and implements projects with a number of partner countries on biodiversity, ecosystems and natural capital accounting, providing support of EUR 170 million by 2020. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU expects to provide EUR 50 million in multilat- eral support by 2020 specifically for the sound man- agement of chemicals and waste \u2014 as their mismanagement primarily affects the poorest. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is investing to support developing countries in the transformation towards an inclusive green economy, particularly in Asia and Africa, this will amount to around EUR 550 million by 2020. Addi- tional resources are being mobilized through blend- ing operations under investment facilities. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is a leader in bilateral and multilateral nego- tiations on liberalising trade in green goods and ser- vices, which must be accelerated to advance global action to mitigate climate change. (cid:2)(cid:3) In addition, EU climate diplomacy is focusing on: (i) maintaining climate change advocacy; (ii) support- ing implementation of the Paris Agreement and related climate plans; and (iii) increasing efforts to address the nexus of climate change, natural resources, prosperity, stability and migration. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is working internally and at international level to encourage green investments, and align the capi- tal markets to the low carbon and climate resilient development in line with the Paris agreement. As also noted in the Capital Markets Union Action Plan, this shift in investment can contribute towards deliv- ering the 2030 climate and energy policy objectives and the EU\u2019s commitments on the Sustainable Devel- opment Goals.

        "7 f i n a n c i n g s u s t a i n a b l e d e v e l o p m e n t Almost 90 % of the EUR 17 billion of sovereign climate finance pledges made in the run-up to COP21 came from the EU and its Member States. For example, France com- mitted to spend by 2020 an extra EUR 2 billion per year on the fight against climate change, raising its total con- tribution from EUR 3 billion to EUR 5 billion. 23 EU Member States have committed collectively more than EUR 4.2 billion to the Green Climate Fund (2015- 2018), half of the pledges received by the fund so far. France is committed to spending an average of EUR 160 million annually in support of biodiversity and to ensure that 50 % of its support to developing countries will also benefit the climate. As a deliverable for the third Financing for Development Conference, the Netherlands, in partnership with the World Bank and others, has launched the Local Water Banks Initiative to present opportunities for water sector investments to private investors in developing countries. Spain has provided EUR 790 million for water and sanita- tion in Latin America. It will continue to support this sec- tor in the coming years. Denmark has established the Danish Climate Investment Fund as an innovative public-private partnership. Over time, the fund is expected to mobilise EUR 1.0-1.3 billion for climate investments in developing countries. Germany annually commits EUR 500 million for the global conservation of biodiversity. On average, half of this funding is allocated to the protection and sustaina- ble management of forests and other ecosystems. Slovenia is funding several projects on safe drinking water and sustainable waste management in the west- ern Balkans. Hungary is committed to continuing to promote sustain- able use of water resources and sustainable water man- agement in the regions of the western Balkans, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The issue is also a priority in Hungary\u2019s development diplomacy, as manifested by the Budapest Water Summit 2016. ",
        "8 5. Trade \u2014 The EU remains the world\u2019s most open market, importing EUR 860 billion annually from developing countries (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU Generalised System of Preferences and GSP+ schemes extended to developing countries are among the most comprehensive, accessible and valuable schemes in the world. Estimates indicate that their monetary value to the developing world amounts to more than EUR 6 billion annually. At the same time, they help to address social and other structural needs in partner countries. (cid:2)(cid:3) According to the latest available data (for 2013), the EU and its Member States have contributed EUR 11.7 billion in Aid for Trade, well over their standing com- mitment of EUR 8 billion, and improved access for LDCs through the provision of EUR 2.6 billion in Aid for Trade in 2013 alone. (cid:2)(cid:3) In October 2015 the EU adopted a strategy known as \u2018Trade for all: Towards a more responsible trade and investment policy\u2019. The goal was to make trade agree- ments more effective, to take account of new eco- nomic realities (such as global supply chains) and to create jobs. The strategy further reinforces synergies between trade and sustainable development through policies to encourage responsible manage- ment of supply chains and support to fair and ethical trade, among others. (cid:2)(cid:3) At the Nairobi World Trade Organization (WTO) Min- isterial Conference in December 2015, the EU contri- bution was instrumental to the conclusion of an important agreement on export competition in agri- culture. The deal provides for the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidy and the intro- duction of substantive disciplines on other poten- tially trade-distorting export-support measures. Germany demonstrates its support for the Aid for Trade initiative by contributing more than EUR 3 billion annu- ally. Belgium will step up its efforts to improve market access for small producer organisations and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises from developing countries which engage in fair and sustainable trade. The UK is co-financing a EUR 6.3 million programme with multinational companies to improve the productivity and sustainability of supply chains by making social invest- ments in farms and factories in developing countries. Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK contribute to TradeMark East Africa in order to support the growth of sustainable trade and economic develop- ment in the region. ",
        "9 6. Science, technology and innovation \u2014 The EU\u2019s EUR 77 billion research and innovation programme, is fully open to participation from developing countries (cid:2)(cid:3) Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, contributed to sustainable development with 46 % of the total expenditure of the year already in 2014; this share is expected to grow over the coming years towards 60 % for sustain- able development, and 35 % for climate action. It is fully open to the world, allowing the participation of researchers and innovators from developing coun- tries. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU and its Member States will jointly provide EUR 2 billion to Sub-Saharan African countries through the European and Developing Countries Clinical Tri- als Partnership. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU and the African Union, together with their respective Member States, started implementing the first priority area for the EU-Africa Research and Inno- vation Partnership focused on food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture. (cid:2)(cid:3) The European Commission is an active member and co-chair of the Belmont Forum, an international grouping of 21 funding agencies, worldwide, sup- porting the co-design and co-development of solu- tion-oriented research for understanding, preventing, mitigating and adapting to global environmental change. The total envelope from the funding agen- cies for joint activities is above than EUR 100 million for the period in 2014-2016. (cid:2)(cid:3) For accelerated development of an Ebola vaccine with long-term efficacy, the EIB has provided a EUR 50 million loan to an international biopharmaceutical company. (cid:2)(cid:3) A \u201cZika call\u201d was launched in spring 2016 and mobi- lised EUR 10 million for research on the Zika virus. The Mission Innovation initiative, launched at COP21 (Conference of Parties) by 20 countries (including France, Germany, Sweden and the UK) and 27 leading investors, aims to double investment for innovation in low-carbon technology and clean energy research in order to incen- tivise \u2014 and lower the cost of \u2014 the development of low-carbon technology and make clean, affordable energy widely available. Finland will leverage private sector innovation for devel- opment through the EUR 50 million Business with Impact programme for 2015-2019. Estonia and Austria will continue efforts to introduce innovative e-governance solutions and practices in inter- ested partner countries. The UK has launched the innovative EUR 1.3 billion Ross Fund, which will develop, test and deliver a range of new medical products (including vaccines, drugs and diag- nostics) to combat the world\u2019s most serious diseases in developing countries. The fund will undertake research and development into anti-microbial resistance, diseases with epidemic potential (such as Ebola) and neglected tropical diseases. ",
        "10 (cid:2)(cid:3) At the Valletta EU-Africa Summit on Migration in November 2015, the EU and its Member States renewed their commitment to contribute to the reduction of remittance costs to below 3 % by 2030 and to eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 %. (cid:2)(cid:3) Through the International Fund for Agriculture and Development\u2019s multi-donor Financing Facility for Remittances (EUR 35 million), the EU funds small- scale projects in developing countries that aim to reduce remittance costs and transaction times and to maximise the impact of remittances on local eco- nomic and social development, especially in rural areas. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is supporting financial inclusion initiatives aimed at bringing 2 billion people into the formal financial system. This contributes to the effort to mobilise close to EUR 500 billion in global diaspora savings per year. (cid:2)(cid:3) By adopting a revised Directive on Payment Services in October 2015, the EU is contributing to enhanced cost transparency, innovation, security and competi- tion with respect to remittances sent from and within the EU. Member States have two years to implement the directive. 7. Remittances \u2014 The EU contributes to reducing remittance costs to free up more funds for development Italy is reducing remittance costs to benefit transfers to the main recipient countries (from 7.65 % in 2009 to 5.3 % in 2015), and engaged in further reducing these costs through promoting competition and transparency. The UK is acting to reduce the cost of remittances by supporting the development of technology-enabled payments infrastructure in developing countries, as well as regulatory and policy reform. Romania supports reducing remittance costs with part- ner countries and has signed an agreement with the Republic of Moldova in this area. Since 2007, Germany has operated www.GeldtransFAIR. de, a web portal for comparing remittance prices, in order to increase transparency and consumer protection. France has enacted a law to enhance migrant banking. The legislation facilitates the access of developing coun- tries\u2019 banks to the French market and allows the develop- ment of specific financial products to benefit diasporas residing in France.

        "11 8. Sustainable agriculture and nutrition \u2014 the EU is acting to lift 500 million people in developing countries out of hunger and malnutrition by 2030 (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU will support 62 developing countries to improve nutrition, enhance resilience to food crises, promote sustainability and boost inclusive growth through agriculture. Among other measures, the Agriculture Financing Initiative aims to mobilise the private sector\u2019s potential to generate inclusive and sustainable growth in developing countries. (cid:2)(cid:3) By 2020, the EU will have invested EUR 8.8 billion in food and nutrition security, of which EUR 3.5 billion will help partner countries to reduce the number of children suffering from undernutrition by 7 million before 2025. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EU is mobilizing a global contribution of about EUR 540 million to support countries most affected by the current food security crisis, including those caused by El Ni\u00f1o. (cid:2)(cid:3) The EIB has invested up to EUR 16 million in the Sen- egal River Valley Rice private sector project which targets the production, processing and storage of rice in the Senegal River Valley. A high developmen- tal impact is expected, contributing to food security, climate change adaptation, and rural poverty reduc- tion. As part of a broad effort involving their partner countries and international actors, and as a significant contribution to the 2030 Agenda, the G7 aims to lift 500 million peo- ple in developing countries out of hunger and malnutri- tion by 2030. Germany is investing EUR 1.5 billion in food and nutrition security under an initiative entitled \u2018One World \u2014 No Hunger\u2019. The Netherlands is working on an initiative to develop the Access to Seeds Index, bridging the gap between the world\u2019s leading seed companies and smallholder farmers. Belgium and Italy are investing EUR 105 million and EUR 500 million, respectively, to improve sustainable agricul- ture and food security. Ireland has now met and is committed to maintaining its target of investing 20 % of the Irish Aid budget in the fight against hunger and undernutrition. Poland will step up its financial support for the develop- ment of sustainable agriculture in its priority countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in its 2016-2020 multiannual development programme. The Danish government and the Investment Fund for Developing Countries have established, in collaboration with pension funds, the new Danish Agribusiness Fund. With a total capital commitment of EUR 110 million, the fund is expected to generate investments of close to EUR 810 million in improved production, distribution and food sales in developing countries.
