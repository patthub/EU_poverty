        "As the dust settles on the Brexit deal, making sense of the 1200-page trade treaty will be no easy task: many businesses face a steep learning curve in the first few months of 2021. EU employers applaud the European Commission negotiating team, expertly led by Michel Barnier. But though reassured, they are certainly not happy with how things have turned out. Brexit in itself is a negative event: at best, the EU could only seek to reduce its harmful impacts. \u00a9 European Union, 2020 ",
        "About the author: Stefano Mallia President of the EESC Employers\u2019 Group Partner at EMCS ltd. The EU has managed an orderly Brexit and remained united throughout the negotiation process \u2013 not a given in 2016 \u2013 so other countries were not tempted to follow the UK's example. More importantly, the EU has protected the single market and its labour, social and environmental standards, avoiding the risk of potential abuses of market power and maintaining the level playing-field. Even if businesses on both sides are relieved that no tariffs are to be levied or restrictive quotas imposed on goods, there will be a whole series of new customs and regulatory checks, including rules of origin and stringent local content requirements. With the deal agreed only days before it came into force on 1 January, businesses face a lot of potentially cumbersome paperwork and supply chains will take a while to adjust to the new reality. This is why businesses need an adjustment period for complying with the changes. Even without the pandemic, it is inconceivable that companies exporting billions worth of goods each year could adapt to a fundamentally different trading model in just one working week. At the same time, there is a clear need to go back to the negotiating table for at least two reasons. First, the deal does not include the services sector, which represents 80% of the UK economy, including the financial sector. While banks had an agreement covering basic transactions, there are up to 40 treaties affecting cross-border activities in the financial services industry that need to be renegotiated. More clarity is needed. In this context, there is no time to waste in revamping the European Union's banking union and capital markets union (CMU) plans. Because of Brexit, EU capital markets and supervision need to become more integrated to better allocate financial resources and to make the EU a more attractive place for foreign investment. The ongoing deep recession increases the need for equity finance mobilised by capital markets. Second, ensuring the smooth flow of data between the EU and the UK is crucial to the future prosperity of both. The EU has yet to reach an adequacy decision regarding the UK \u2013 there is an urgent need to make progress here so that data can continue to flow between our economies and our businesses. According to Digital Europe, six out of every ten European companies transfer data on a regular basis between the EU and UK. Last but not least, there is the question of mutual recognition of qualifications, which is not part of the deal. In the absence of an EU-wide agreement, UK bodies will seek other mutual recognition routes, which could be complex, protracted, and only achievable on a country-by-country basis. There is a clear need now for qualification bodies in the EU and the UK to put forward a proposal for mutual recognition in the future. If we want Europe and the UK to remain closely linked economically, financially and psychologically once the trade agreement is fully operational, we need to continue working on our relationship. The agreement must be a solid platform for future cooperation between the EU and the UK in a number of areas that have a strong impact on our competitive environment \u2013 ranging from climate change to digital transformation, research and innovation, or standards. The deal was just the end of the beginning. The UK can never be just another third country. It has a special relationship with the EU which was built over 45 years of EU membership. Civil society and employers in particular must continue to work together with their counterparts in the UK to ensure that the relationship can and does continue in this post-Brexit era. The EESC is determined to set up a framework to sustain the dialogue with British civil society. For our part, we must fight to keep our channels of trade open and do our best to build a sound structure that allows this to happen. \u00a9 Shutterstock/ Efasein \u00a9 European Union, 2019 ",
        "Let us not forget that China's very existence is dependent on the European and American markets. However, there is reason to make the Chinese government unmistakably aware of the common concern of the EU and the USA, even before the agreement comes into force, not only to comply with the sealed agreements, but also to take visible confidence-building steps towards respect for human rights as a prerequisite for sustained good economic relations. Under the deal, China has pledged to continue ratifying international conventions on forced labour, which has reportedly been one of the final stumbling blocks in the talks. Unfortunately, Beijing has repeatedly broken binding agreements in the past and in recent history. The brutal crackdown on democratic forces and the increased influence of independent media in Hong Kong are an unmistakable reminder of the violation of bilateral and international obligations, which cannot remain an internal matter. The same applies to the practices that violate human rights - including forced labour - against the Uighurs. The CEO of a large German company, which is particularly successful in China, was for example compelled to publicly declare he was \"not aware\" of concentration camps, contrary to general knowledge. Such pressure and such obvious human rights violations are not in line with good, prosperous and sustainable economic relations. To make sure the agreement is indeed a success, it is crucial that a role be carved out for civil society, especially employers who, at the end of the day, will be the main actors responsible for its implementation. The agreement is good for both the EU and China, but it can and should also serve as a beacon for the development of a strong common transatlantic agenda for China in the years to come. Even if the deal, known as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), has not yet been signed and is not yet publicly available - which calls for prudence when pronouncing our final judgement - public opinion is highly divided on it. Some call it a 'big ticket' for the German EU presidency, while others see it as a big mistake. An investment deal was at the time the most promising way of deepening cooperation between the two economic heavyweights China and EU. The CAI promises to open up the Chinese market to EU companies. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said it \"will give European investors unprecedented access to the Chinese market\". Furthermore, the creation of fair trade and investment conditions should not only bring benefits to the EU and China, but also to the whole world, by reducing poverty, even the most severe poverty, and by sustainably increasing the number of those living in prosperity and with improved social security. As long as genuine will exists and is demonstrated by both sides to strengthen mutual access and cooperation, differences will also be overcome. In the EU, just before the agreement enters into force, we now have to coordinate quickly with the European Parliament and with the most important partners on the agreement's implementation and possible consequences. Signing the treaty without certainty of its ratification would not be advisable. It is in the interests of an increasingly interconnected and globalised world that the EU find its appropriate and stable path in its relations with China and other Asian nations. US companies already have better access to the Chinese market than EU companies. China should also have generous access to the European internal market on a reciprocal basis. However, an independent European route should not be exclusive. The EU and the USA are founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy with independent jurisdiction, similar economic principles and respect for human rights. In the post-Trump era, the EU must first and foremost actively stimulate and strengthen transatlantic relations. The investment treaty will make the EU and the US largely equal in terms of access to the Chinese market. For this reason, it will now be important to agree a coordinated approach with the US in the event of disruptions. About the author: Peter Clever Vice-President of the EESC Employers\u2019 Group National Union of German Employers' Associations (BDA) After seven years and over 30 rounds of negotiations, the EU and China have finally concluded 'in principle' an investment agreement. \u00a9 European Union , 2020 ",
        "\u00a9 Shutterstock / HAKINMHAN The EU target of reducing carbon emissions in the atmosphere by 55% by 2030 is calculated on the basis of 1990 as the start-date. We have seen a decrease of around 20% since then, so this decline is expected to speed up significantly over the next 10 years. The transport sector is the only one that has seen its climate footprint increase since 1990, and this applies to land, water and air transport. This sector also has a very ambitious target of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. Biofuels, biogas, electric vehicles and even hydrogen will not be enough to achieve this. A fundamental change in behaviour will therefore be needed and this will undoubtedly involve a drastic reduction in travel and in the freedom that the car offers the European citizen. Overall, household budgets will adapt: less will be spent on heating and travel, but more will be invested in low-energy or even positive -energy housing or in more collective modes of transport; car- pooling, electric cars and renewable fuels will become more popular options. I don't know whether this project and this ambition will inspire European citizens to dream, but it is essential that we stick to this collective commitment that our leaders have given on our behalf, as a result of which our lives will be different to those of our parents, and our children will be able to appreciate our achievements. I personally believe that a number of taboos need to be discussed, as the Commission and the Parliament do not always demonstrate complete transparency. Nuclear energy is a vital tool for providing a volume of low-carbon electricity that photovoltaic, wind, biogas or hydrogen power will not be able to produce with current techniques. Similarly, forests need to be enriched with varieties that capture much more carbon, and not only contain indigenous species. Agriculture must be able to benefit from the New Breeding Techniques (NBT), which, because of their yield and the resistance of the plants generated, make it possible to produce more with fewer inputs. Finally, it is important to stress that the carbon sink formed by cultivated soils can only exist with the use of glyphosate. Ca rbon sinks will be taken into account, so we are talking about a net decrease of 55%. There are three sources of carbon sinks: oceans, forests and land. While this target seems achievable in theory, in practice, all of Europe's citizens and businesses will experience far-reaching changes in the way they live, in their budget and in their work. Before we can become carbon-neutral by 2050, the 2030 deadline means reducing carbon emissions from the construction sector by 40% and from transport and agriculture by 25% within a decade. It also means maximising the carbon sink of forests and thus improving their productivity. The waste sector will also need to reduce its carbon footprint by almost 30%, while the energy sector will need to reduce its footprint by 35%. Industry, for its part, must also achieve a 30% reduction in its consumption and carbon emissions. The Commission will be setting out all of these targets by June 2021. All of the regulations are being introduced in the spirit of 'do no harm', which is likely to prove difficult. It is essential to protect our industry, agriculture and services through a carbon border adjustment mechanism. We need to protect ourselves from carbon leakage, and these measures must be included in all trade agreements. Soil fertility should also be boosted in order to capture more carbon and thus avoid shortages of water or other nutrients. The carbon credit system should encourage producers to plant hedges, maintain lignocellulosic strips and reforest land with a variety of trees. Legislation on renewable fuels will need to be reviewed. Biogas production must become commonplace. More investment will be needed in research and development for new technologies, as we will not be able to feed seven and a half billion people with the same methods as those used a century ago, when the planet had only one and a half billion inhabitants. The agricultural sector is the only one that represents both a problem and a solution: it must reduce its emissions while increasing its capture. The construction sector, which is responsible for 40% of final energy consumption, must ensure that all or at least some of Europe's buildings are built or renovated in such a way that total neutrality can be achieved by 2050, as will be explained in another opinion entitled Renovation Wave in the buildings sector and opportunities for green European recovery.

        "The specific content of the Regulation requires further examination. However, already at this stage it seems that the draft regulation's four-pillar structure provides the necessary balance in terms of flexibility, adaptability and legal security for the players concerned: a closed list of core services, a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria to designate gatekeepers, a set of obligations that are immediately applicable and some where regular dialogues are necessary, and tools (market investigations) to identify new services or new practices. The same balancing approach will have to be considered between the scope of intervention (list of core services and criteria that determine gatekeepers) and the list of obligations to fulfil. These considerations will be brought to the working group of the INT section in charge of drawing up an opinion on this draft regulation. The COVID-19 crisis has considerably increased the importance of e-commerce and trading via digital platforms in the EU economy. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is one of the key elements of a framework seeking to ensure a fair and contestable online platform environment and better functioning of the internal market. This proposal will spark a great deal of comment, and many debates will take place inside and outside debating chambers; however, I would like to set out some initial comments here that come to mind on the very first reading. Online platforms are recognised as important economic players, boosting efficiency, as well as spurring on innovation and the development of new business models. We want to reap the full benefits of the digital economy and give new online players the possibility to grow and innovate in a fair, open and secure environment. That is why, even if issues and needs have been brought to light during the last decade, safeguarding a fair and innovation-friendly business environment remains fundamental. Equally fundamental: obtaining a level playing field between EU and non-EU online operators. The DMA positively addresses this by focusing on specific services regardless of the place of establishment of the service provider or the law applicable to the provision of the service. Another key challenge in this process will be to avoid further fragmentation of the internal market. Since the publication of this draft, many Member States have already announced their plans to adopt their own domestic legislation. The DMA Regulation should be seen as one set of maximum standards for all and not a base for Member States to add to. \u00a9 Shutterstock/ Novikov Aleksey About the author: Emilie Prouzet Member of the EESC Employers\u2019 Group French Business Confederation The year 2020 ended with a series of disastrous earthquakes in Croatia. Measuring 5.2 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, the two earthquakes that hit the regions of Sisak-Moslavina County and parts of Zagreb and Karlovac Counties were the strongest recorded in the last 140 years. The disaster cost eight people their lives, left several wounded and caused damage to 46 000 buildings. Business was hit hard by the earthquakes, leaving over 5 000 SMEs in need of support. The Croatian members of the EESC Employers' Group have been heavily involved through their organisations in helping businesses to overcome this devastating situation, e.g. by calling for financial subsidies from the government or providing hands-on support by donating 28 000 m2 of plastic foil for broken roofs. EESC Employers' Group members from other member countries have also shown real solidarity by stepping up to support Croatian businesses. Ms Jeli\u0107, vice-president of the Employers' Group, is grateful for the valuable and practical support that has been received from the Group's colleagues. Over the last ten years, issues affecting the digital market have been brought to light by competition cases, studies and experts, in terms of both competition and internal market rules. ",
        "About the author: Gon\u00e7alo Lobo Xavier Member of the EESC Employers\u2019 Group Confederation of Portuguese Business (CIP) Extraordinary times produce extraordinary choices: This was what the 27 decided to do when they agreed on the EUR 1.8 billion package, selecting the green and digital transformation of our economy. More than 50% of the funds are dedicated to supporting modernisation through policies on research and innovation, fair digital and climate transitions and preparedness, recovery and resilience, with around 30% of the financial package dedicated to fighting climate change. We are confident that the thousands of companies operating in the EU will be among the first to help implement this agenda. The track record of many of them on issues such as digitalisation, the circular economy, sustainable production, combating food waste and enhancing the value of people, whether consumers or workers across the EU, and their skills is the best indication that we are dealing with businesses committed to Europe\u2019s economic and social development. The EESC Employers\u2019 Group will, from the outset, align its work with this agenda and these challenges and will contribute as a representative of responsible civil society. We know that 2021 will continue to be an abnormal year, but Portugal has the opportunity to be recognised as the country whose presidency set Europe\u2019s recovery in motion. A year ago, nobody thought the Portuguese presidency would be dealing with the unprecedented pandemic. Part of preparatory work was compromised by the emergency faced by member states. Thus, many of the initiatives - political, social and public had to be rethought to fight against the virus and plan for Europe\u2019s reconstruction. Never before has it been so timely to talk about cooperation and solidarity. The welcome result is that the EU has responded well to this huge challenge. EUR 1.8 billion was earmarked to shape the EU recovery and make it more sustainable, more digital and more resilient. The agreement to launch the various recovery programmes linked to EU long-term budget was finally concluded in December 2020. The responsibility is huge and Portugal now has the opportunity, as the Member State leading the process, to pin down the common European commitments and values that will help drive forward the now 27 Member States of a European Union in need of credibility and quick results for all citizens. The ratification by all 27 national parliaments and the adoption of regulations linked to the recovery will be no easy task. But I believe that Portugal will be able to stand out, having presided over an economic turnaround that has restored confidence to a country that the European debt crisis brought to its knees. This was done through consensual leadership and conciliatory partnerships, which could be a key asset in achieving speed and sustainability in decision-making processes. \u00a9 Shutterstock / Alexandros Michailidis Portugal will be chairing the rotating presidency of the EU at one of the most complex times in the life of the 27-country bloc. Following on from Germany and paving the way for Slovenia\u2019s leadership in the second half of 2021, Portugal has the responsibility and opportunity to take decisive steps towards the post-Covid recovery. \u00a9 Shutterstock/Alexandros Michailidis ",
        "Climate neutrality and digital leadership will not be an easy task for Europe. The transformative agenda of the European Green Deal is as demanding as it is compelling. Some business leaders see this as a Herculean task, but EU employers are ready to switch gear and accelerate the roll-out of the green and digital transitions. It is clear that decarbonisation will impose costs on energy- intensive companies while requiring a massive structural change in the industrial, transport and energy sectors, which could put businesses at an economic disadvantage in a competitive global market. But it can be achieved if the EU's overarching climate policy objective is balanced with an ambitious industrial strategy that boosts competitiveness \u2013 and an equally ambitious energy policy designed to ensure long-term energy security and affordability. There is no doubt that the updated industrial strategy which the Commission is expected to deliver early next year must reconcile major strands of energy policy with industrial competitiveness. To maintain competitiveness, we need an energy revolution, providing security of supply for businesses and households without pushing up prices, while increasing both network connectivity and storage capacity. Hydrogen has a key role to play in this process and relevant applications need to be developed as a priority. At the same time, digital solutions are indispensable to progress towards the goals of the Green Deal. As Europe is lagging behind in digital development and high-speed connectivity, a 'Digital Deal' for Europe is needed. We firmly believe that European companies have the research capacity and the technological solutions to help our continent become a leading independent actor in the digital field. But one factor in the equation is missing, and that is investment. The EU recovery package will provide comprehensive public financial support, which must be matched by private funding, if we want to make sure we create the right conditions for successful recovery. The EU must stand on its own, between China and the United States, and invest in the technology of the next generation. Europe has no alternative but to develop its own vision and strategy for digital sovereignty, while remaining open to free trade and supporting the multilateral system. Strategically it must focus on getting its infrastructure, cybersecurity, cloud, key enabling technology and data in place and convince global partners of the quality of its standards and products. We have to realise that we are at a critical juncture. Failure to take the necessary action now will have deep and long-lasting repercussions on Europe's role in shaping the global future. Failure on this front is not an option. On 9 December 2020, the Employers' Group held a webinar on decarbonisation and digitalisation in the context of globalisation. A number of recommendations were adopted after the webinar, and what clearly came out of the inspiring debate is that European businesses are ready to take up the challenge and develop new business models to make the economy greener and more digital. This will require the EU to facilitate new models of cooperation and industrial alliances, provide sufficient investment capacity, and build clear and enabling regulatory frameworks. The webinar was moderated by Employers' Group member Sandra Parthie, and attended by high-level speakers representing industry and politics: Maive Rute, Deputy Director- General at DG GROW, Arndt G\u00fcnther Kirchhoff, CEO and Managing Partner at Kirchhoff Holding GmbH & Co., and Dr Thomas Koenen, head of Digitalisation and Innovation at the Federation of German Industries.

At the moment, many companies are collapsing. Others are struggling to survive or have to reconsider their investment plans. People are losing their jobs, and uncertainty reigns in our societies. From the macroeconomic point of view, these adverse developments could easily become cumulative and further aggravate the situation, especially if the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) is not implemented properly and in a timely manner. We need to move fast. The EU countries must urgently reach an agreement on the whole package of #NextGenerationEU, thus enabling the financial support for recovery to be disbursed and rolled out as soon as possible, in a fully contra-cyclical fashion. Financial support from the RRF will be channelled to the Member States following the adoption of their national recovery plans (NRPs), currently in the process of being drafted. NRPs have to become the blueprint for national recovery efforts, reform processes and guidelines for the green and digital transition, thus combining cyclical with structural measures. The way NRPs are designed and subsequently implemented will determine how well we weather the current crisis and how companies can survive, but also how our economies will develop and grow in the future. It is thus essential to provide the best possible support to businesses to survive, grow and embark on the green and digital transition, taking into account the specific needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Recovery plans will be successful only if they reflect reality on the ground. This is why they should be developed and implemented in close cooperation with regional and local authorities, civil society organisations and the social partners. With this in mind, it is essential for relevant stakeholders to be involved in consultations on NRPs at all stages of their development, drafting and implementation. If stakeholders are properly involved in this process, they will ultimately have full ownership of the plans and will be able to implement measures correctly and successfully, taking into account the specific needs of the economic sectors most severely hit by the crisis and thereby ensuring speedy recovery, growth and job creation. To this end, we, the employers, call on all EU governments to involve the social partners and civil society organisations in a timely and relevant manner. On 10 December, EU leaders gave the final green light to the EU\u2019s unprecedented budget deal to overcome the worst recession in a century. In total, up to EUR 1.8 trillion will be spent by 2027 to boost the bloc\u2019s economy in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic whilst also making it more sustainable and digital, partly thanks to the EUR 750 billion recovery fund. \u00a9 Shutterstock / Angelina Bambina "
