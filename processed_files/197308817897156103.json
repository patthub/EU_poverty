        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal Europe is at a crucial point in time where its relevance and success in the decades to come will be determined by its ability to remain competitive in the global economy and ensure high levels of employment, education and training, health, social inclusion and active participation in society. Making Europe competitive, cohesive and resilient in the future means investing in its people now: in their education and training, skills, creativity, potential to create businesses and to innovate, and in their health. Furthermore, a number of challenges remain significant. Despite improvements, tackling unemployment and persistently high rates of poverty remains a priority throughout the EU. Social and employment issues are a primary concern of European citizens, and an area where more is expected from the Union. Additional challenges that the Union faces are related to: \uf0b7 shortfalls in skill levels, \uf0b7 under-performance in active labour market policy and education systems, \uf0b7 challenges arising from new technology such as automation and the related new forms of work, \uf0b7 social exclusion of marginalised groups including Roma and migrants, \uf0b7 and low labour mobility. There is a need both for policy initiatives and for targeted supporting actions to address these challenges. As a response to the call from our citizens to enhance the social dimension of the Union, on 17 November 2017 the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission jointly proclaimed the European Pillar of Social Rights. It is now important that the European institutions and the Member States work together to deliver on the principles and rights enshrined in the Pillar. On 2 May 2018, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for 2021-2027 1 . The proposal reflects the current social and economic context and provides a concrete response to the call from the European public for a more social Europe and for greater investment in people in the European Union. In this context, this proposal includes the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) as the EU\u2019s main instrument to invest in people and to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights. The ESF+ merges the following funds and programmes: \u2013 the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI); \u2013 the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD); \u2013 the Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) programme and \u2013 the Programme for the Union\u2019s action in the field of health (the Health Programme). The aim of merging the above funds is threefold: 1 Reference, COM(2018) 322 final, 2.5.2018. ",
        "EN 2 EN \u2013 To enhance coherence and synergies between complimentary EU instruments which provide important support to people and which aim to improve their standards of living, by developing more integrated approaches to programming and implementation. \u2013 To increase flexibility and to allow the funds to be more responsive to the challenges identified in the economic governance cycle and to EU-level priorities. \u2013 To allow simplification of fund programming and management thus reducing the administrative burden for authorities and beneficiaries. Therefore, the ESF+ will help build an empowering social Europe and contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion in accordance with Article 174 TFEU, which is a necessary condition for the proper functioning of the EU as a stable and viable economic and political union. This overall proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of 27 Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and Euratom based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The ESF+ supports policies and priorities which aim to help create full employment, enhance quality and productivity at work, increase the geographical and occupational mobility of workers within the Union, improve education and training systems, and promote social inclusion and health. The overarching policy objective of the ESF+ Regulation is help create a more performing and resilient \u2018Social Europe\u2019 and implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as the social and employment priorities endorsed by the European economic governance process. The ESF+ will contribute to implementing the Integrated Guidelines adopted in accordance with Articles 121 and 148(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the relevant country-specific recommendations adopted in the context of the European semester, and feed into the overall objective of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth beyond 2030 (the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals 2 ) and upward convergence. Furthermore, the ESF+ will help to improve employment opportunities, raise the standard of living and health, and help increase labour mobility and economic, social and territorial cohesion as set out in the TFEU and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The ESF+ also aims to contribute to the Skills Agenda for Europe and the integration of third country nationals. Setting a minimum share and amounts for the ESF+ under shared management as one of the Structural Funds will ensure that the EU\u2019s priorities described above are adequately reflected in the volume of investment that directly target European citizens. \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies The ESF+ aims to improve synergies and coherence with other funds investing in human capital development. The ESF+ should in particular ensure complementarities and synergies with the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), the Erasmus 2 United Nations Resolution adopted on 25 September 2015, http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&Lang=E ",
        "EN 3 EN Programme and the European Solidarity Corps, the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMIF), as well as with the Horizon Europe Programme and the Digital Europe Programme, the Reform Support Programme, including the Reform Delivery Tool. The ESF+ and EGF will continue to complement each other, as the ESF+ will continue to support preventive and anticipatory measures, while the EGF will remain a reactive emergency fund outside the MFF. The ESF+ and Erasmus are active in similar fields, notably helping people gain new skills, upskilling to answer the need of industrial sectors 3 , improving digital competences and quality of education and training. Cooperation between the ESF+ and Erasmus will therefore be enhanced. The exact nature of the cooperation will be further detailed in the work programmes and programme guides for ESF+ and Erasmus, thus allowing for effective and efficient synergies. The ESF+ will also continue to support the mid and long-term integration of third country nationals in complementarity to the AMF, which will cover short-term needs. The shared management strand of the ESF+ will continue to be part of cohesion policy and it will mainly be regulated by the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR). As such, the same rules on management, programming, monitoring, auditing, etc. will apply as for most of the other Funds under shared management. Programmes in Member States can continue to combine European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding and ESF+ funding through multi-fund programmes. For the Health strand, an adequate governance structure will provide strategic guidelines and technical opinions on measures to support and implement the strand. It will also help in coordinating complementary support lines of the research, digital market, regional and cohesion funds, and others. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. The contribution of this programme to the achievement of this overall target will be tracked through an EU climate marker system at an appropriate level of disaggregation, including the use of more precise methodologies where these are available. The Commission will continue to present the information annually in terms of commitment appropriations in the context of the annual draft budget. To support the full utilisation of the potential of the programme to contribute to climate objectives, the Commission will seek to identify relevant actions throughout the programme preparation, implementation, review and evaluation processes. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis Titles IX (Employment), X (Social policy) and XIV (Public health) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular, Articles 46, 149, 153, 162 to 166, 168, 174, 175 and 349 of TFEU, provide the legal framework for the measures covered by this proposal. 3 In line with the Blueprint for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills, key action of the Skills Agenda for Europe. ",
        "EN 4 EN The ESF+ has three strands. The first strand, implemented under shared management, covers the (ex-) ESF, which is based on Articles 162 and 164 TFEU and basic material assistance to the most deprived people, under Article 175(3) TFEU. The second strand, implemented under direct and indirect management, covers actions promoting employment and social innovation (EaSI), based on Article 175(3) TFEU. The third strand, implemented under direct management, concerns incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health under Article 168 TFEU. This proposal defines the general objectives of the ESF+ and the scope of support, which is translated into specific objectives. It lays down common provisions, applicable to the three strands, and specific provisions for each strand. Additionally, the Commission adopted on 29 May 2018 a proposal for a 'Common Provisions' Regulation in order to improve the coordination and harmonise the implementation of support under shared management, with the main aim of simplifying policy delivery. The ESF+ strand under shared management is covered by these common provisions. The different Funds in shared management pursue complementary objectives and share the same management mode, therefore Regulation (EU) No [Regulation laying down Common Provisions] sets out a series of common general objectives and general principles such as partnership and multi-level governance. That Regulation also contains the common elements of strategic planning and programming, including provisions on the Partnership Agreement to be concluded with each Member State, and sets out a common approach to the performance orientation of the Funds. Accordingly, it includes enabling conditions, performance review and arrangements for monitoring, reporting and evaluation. Common provisions are also set out with regard to eligibility rules, and special arrangements are defined for financial instruments, the use of the InvestEU Fund, community-led local development and financial management. Some management and control arrangements are also common to all Funds. \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) In the areas of social and employment policy and public health, the EU has either shared competence with Member States (Article 4 TFEU), competence to lay down arrangements within which they must coordinate their action (Article 5 TFEU) or competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States (Article 6 TFEU). The ESF+ under shared management strand is underpinned by the subsidiarity principle. Under shared management, the Commission delegates strategic programming and implementation tasks to the EU Member States and regions. It also limits EU action to what is necessary to achieve its objectives as laid down in the Treaties. Shared management aims to ensure that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen and that EU-level action is justified in light of the possibilities and specificities at national, regional or local level. Shared management brings Europe closer to its citizens and connects local needs with European objectives. 4 Moreover, it increases ownership of EU objectives, as Member States and the Commission share decision-making power and responsibility. The subsidiarity principle also underpins the two strands under direct and indirect management. The EaSI strand will focus on projects with an innovative dimension in which 4 High Level Expert Group monitoring simplification for beneficiaries of ESI Funds (2017), '' Key recommendations of the High Level Group on Simplification for the post 2020 Cohesion Policy'', available at: http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/reports/2017/esif-simplification-hlg-proposal- for-policymakers-for-post-2020. ",
        "EN 5 EN there is clear EU added value, meaning that EU action is more effective than action taken at national, regional or local level to reach critical mass and reduce administrative burden. The Health strand recognises the EU dimension of health and complements and supports Member States health policies while respecting their competence in the area, in line with Article 168 TFEU. \u2022 Proportionality In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its goals. The principle of proportionality has guided the Commission's proposal because it proposes further simplification in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on monitoring simplification for beneficiaries of ESI Funds. 5 The proposal is proportional as it has unified and consolidated rules and merges the Funds, therefore reducing the burden on stakeholders. The administrative burden on the Union and on the national authorities has been limited to what is necessary for the Commission to exercise its responsibility for implementing the Union budget. \u2022 Choice of the instrument The choice of instrument is a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council to establish the European Social Fund Plus. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation \u2013 The European Social Fund (ESF) Strengths : The 2000-2006 6 and 2007-2013 ESF ex-post evaluations 7 recognise ESF investment as relevant, efficient and effective. The Fund was effective in reaching a significant number of EU citizens, in particular those most in need of support. This was because the ESF provided significant financial resources to address employment and social challenges in Member States and broadened existing action by supporting policy areas or groups that would not otherwise have received support. Furthermore, the ESF has supported local/regional innovations that are then mainstreamed at national level. In 2014-2020, the intervention logics of the programmes have become more robust with clearer specific objectives, more standardised indicator definitions and sounder baselines and targets. Weaknesses: \u2013 Policy alignment: while the Fund's link to the European Semester improved significantly in the 2014-2020 programming period 8 , it is not yet optimal. \u2013 Programming: evidence showed that in 2014-2020 result orientation was strengthened but the performance framework has not proved to be a sufficient 5 Ibid. 6 http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6470&langId=en 7 Ex-post evaluation of the 2007-2013 ESF Programmes , Commission Staff Working Document (SWD(2016)452 final, 12.12.2016) 8 Study on the support of ESI Funds to the implementation of the Country-Specific Recommendations and to structural reforms in Member States.

Programming requirements have been criticised for being administratively burdensome. 9 \u2013 Programme implementation : studies show that, despite some progress, ESF management and delivery remains too complex. Despite improvements in 2014-2020 the shift from a logic based on inputs towards one based on results has not fully taken place. \u2013 The Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) Strengths: The YEI has increased the visibility of youth employment policies and has driven policy reforms in a number of Member States in the context of the set-up and implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes. Member States report that the YEI is of critical importance for the coverage and design of employment policy in their country. Weaknesses: The main challenges relate to its financial management (being funded from two funding sources \u2013 the YEI specific allocation and the ESF) and the additional reporting requirements. These elements have been perceived by beneficiaries and implementing authorities as increasing the administrative burden. 10 \u2013 The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) Strengths: Preliminary results of the mid-term evaluation of the FEAD, including results of stakeholder consultations 11 , indicate that the food, material aid and social inclusion measures it supports make a difference to the most deprived people in society, including those who otherwise may be left out by mainstream social assistance or who need immediate support. Weaknesses: The EU regulatory framework and its interpretation or national requirements can lead to difficulties in implementing the Fund. Difficulties include delays in the start-up phase of the programme and administrative obstacles mostly linked to national procurement policies and to additional requirements such as recording data/information on operations and end recipients for monitoring purposes and excessive and lengthy procedures. \u2013 The Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) programme Strengths: The mid-term evaluation shows that in 2014-2016 the EaSI programme was efficient and effective in helping to raise awareness about EU policy inputs in the area of social inclusion and poverty reduction. The evaluation also showed that the EaSI programme improved perception of the cross-border potential for employment and contributed to a rapid testing and implementation of innovative measures and increased access to microfinance loans and support for entrepreneurship. EaSI also facilitated policy change by disseminating comparative and analytical knowledge, building capacity, mutual learning and dialogue, and by helping different stakeholders to influence the formulation and implementation of socio- economic policies. Weaknesses: More could be done to improve the relevance and impact of EaSI. The PROGRESS axis should improve the efforts to deliver social policy experimentations by revising the procedures for evaluating and selecting projects and by creating the conditions for 9 Final conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Simplification for post 2020, pp.12-13, http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/newsroom/pdf/simplification_proposals.pdf. 10 Study supporting the impact assessment of human capital investments, European Commission (ongoing). 11 Report on the Open public consultation for the FEAD mid-term evaluation, January 2018 available at https://publications.europa.eu/s/fo2y ",
        "EN 7 EN scaling them up. For EURES, a longer implementation period combined with measures for reducing the administrative burden may enable stakeholders to properly develop, implement, measure the effectiveness and ensure the sustainability of projects. \u2013 The Health Programme Strengths: The mid-term evaluation confirmed the EU added value of actions, notably in the form of increased capacity in the Member States to address cross border health threats, of technical guidelines and recommendations for cancer, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis prevention, of additional support for EU health legislation on medicinal products and medical devices, as well as the eHealth Network activities and Health Technology Assessment. The evaluation also recognised the added value of tools to control healthcare-associated infections and to step up coordinated efforts to fight against antimicrobial resistance, and of the extensive groundwork pursued through Joint Actions to identify and transfer best practices for the prevention and management of diseases. It also recognised the positive contribution of actions to increase the interoperable and standardised cross-border exchange of health data, and of those efforts to set up EU-wide digital infrastructures for that purpose. Weaknesses: In non-legislative areas where actions can be more open-ended or broadly defined, the mid-term evaluation revealed that there is a danger of those actions being less focused. There is scope to streamline the added-value criteria to focus on three key areas: addressing cross-border health threats, improving economies of scale, and fostering the exchange and implementation of best practices. There were also some inefficiencies and inadequacies with the monitoring of implementation data, which can make it harder for programme managers to keep an up-to-date overview of the programme's achievements. \u2022 Stakeholder consultations The stakeholder consultations were based on a stakeholders mapping , which covers the main EU organisations and institutions working in the field of social and employment policy and relevant investment \u2013 public authorities at all levels of government, social partners, civil society organisations, funding beneficiaries and end-users as well as citizens across the EU. The stakeholder consultation used a variety of methods and tools to reach a sufficient variety and number of stakeholders, and to cross check opinions. The consultation activities included several Open Public Consultations performed as part of the MFF, the ex-post evaluation of the ESF, the FEAD mid-term evaluation and the EaSI mid-term evaluation. The consultation also involved stakeholder conferences and meetings, focus groups, interviews, targeted online consultation and analysis of position papers. More information on the stakeholder consultations is available in the Impact Assessment. The main conclusions from the stakeholder consultations were: \u2013 The added value of the funds is linked to promoting effective and efficient public investment, streamlining the exchange of knowledge between countries and regions, improving social integration and creating a more inclusive Europe, supporting policy experimentation and innovation, reducing regional disparities and facilitating convergence. The funds also add value through the leverage effect of cohesion policy on public and private investment. \u2013 Complex procedures are seen as the most important obstacle to funds successfully achieving their objectives. ",
        "EN 8 EN \u2013 There was a call to simplify and reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries including less burdensome requirements on collecting data from participants. \u2013 There is a need to strengthen the social dimension. \u2013 The rules for the various EU funds should be aligned. \u2013 There was a call to strengthen synergies and avoid duplication and overlaps between EU instruments. Merging funds was identified as the best way to achieve this goal, provided that merging also helps to simplify the EU instruments. \u2013 The policy papers show considerable interest in improving the links between the funds and the European Semester . \u2013 Current public health issues can only be effectively dealt with through collaboration at EU level. There is an added value in the EU addressing common challenges such as health inequalities, migration, an ageing population, patient safety, high quality health care, tackling health threats including non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. The main proposals addressing stakeholders\u2019 feedback are outlined below: \u2013 To enhance synergies and avoid overlaps between funding instruments investing in people and their needs, the ESF, YEI, FEAD, EaSI and the Health Programme will be merged into one Fund (the ESF+). This will make it easier for beneficiaries to access funding, help them combine different types of measures, and simplify the management of funding. \u2013 To respond to the call for strengthening the social dimension: \uf0b7 The scope of support for ESF+ is aligned with the European Pillar of Social Rights . Merging different instruments under the ESF+ will make it possible to pool resources for the implementation of the principles of the Pillar. \uf0b7 The social inclusion dimension of the ESF+ will be strengthened by integrating the FEAD and the ESF. This allows for an easier combination of provisions of food/material assistance with support for social inclusion and active measures. \uf0b7 At least 25 % of national ESF+ resources will be earmarked for promoting social inclusion and tackling poverty. Moreover, Member States will have to allocate at least 2% of their ESF+ resources for measures targeting the most deprived. This ensures that a minimum amount of resources target those most in need. \u2013 In order to simplify the implementation of the ESF+, reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries and shift the focus to the achievement of results, several provisions are introduced in the CPR . However, the ESF+ Regulation also provides formeasures to tackle material deprivation in order to address the stakeholders\u2019 request to maintain lighter requirements for this type of assistance and simplified data collection and monitoring and reporting requirements. \u2013 To ensure stronger alignment with the European Semester process an adequate amount of resources from national ESF+ resources will be allocated to implementing challenges identified in the European Semester process. ",
        "EN 9 EN \u2022 Collection and use of expertise The Commission has based its decisions on expertise collected through a number of studies as well as on Member States\u2019 reports on the implementation of the ESF. The studies used a range of methods including literature reviews, targeted surveys, interviews, focus groups, and economic modelling. The reports and studies are listed in the impact assessment. The ESF+ proposal has taken into account recommendations from the studies by enhancing synergies and complementarities between the funds, strengthening the link with EU policy priorities while increasing flexibility, and by including a number of measures to reduce administrative burden, such as enhanced simplified cost options and simplified monitoring and reporting requirements. \u2022 Impact assessment This proposal is supported by an impact assessment. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board hearing took place on the 25 April 2018, where the impact assessment received a positive opinion with reservation 12 . The table below outlines the main comments received and how the impact assessment was amended to reflect these. Main Regulatory Scrutiny Board considerations Impact assessment report modifications (1) The policy prioritisation of actions is not clear, in particular in relation to the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as to accommodate potential reductions of funding. The text clarifies a potential reduction of funding would be addressed by limiting the scope of the ESF+ in the area of administrative reform and by increasing the national co-financing rates. (3) The report does not sufficiently demonstrate that the monitoring and evaluation system is robust and will deliver the necessary information in a timely way. Additional information on the monitoring and evaluation system has been inserted in Section 5. Further considerations and adjustment requirements (1) The lessons learned should more comprehensively build on the main general and fund-specific challenges identified in the published evaluations and preliminary evaluations results. Published evaluations, preliminary evaluation results and stakeholder consultations have identified specific challenges to each of the funds. When analysing them, it appeared that they could be grouped in to the four overall MFF challenges, i.e. interaction and synergies between funds, alignment to policies and flexibility, simplification and performance and result orientation. The cross cutting MFF challenges find therefore a translation for each fund (Section 2.1.2.2). (2) Clarify the main rationale for merging the funds and the risks associated to the merge. Additional explanation has been included in order to explain the reasons for merging the relevant funds together and for keeping the EGF out of this new fund. In addition, the main risk raised by stakeholders that the merged fund would increase the administrative burden is mitigated as ex-FEAD and EaSI type of measures will remain subject to 12 http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/?fuseaction=ia&language=en ",
        "EN 10 EN simpler rules (Section 4.1.1). (3) The baseline of the ESF+ programme needs to reflect the impact of Brexit. Baseline following Brexit inserted in the text under section 2.1.1. (4) Be more transparent on the prioritisation of the ESF+. Clarify the key changes in the policy priorities of the ESF+, including as regards the link to the European Pillar of Social Rights. Explain if and how the ESF+ will cover all or some of the different domains on the Pillar. Better explain the link between the structural reforms and the European Semester Process. It was clarified in the text of the report that the merged fund will not as such change the priorities of the funding instrument, which results to be an aggregation of the previously partly overlapping policy priorities of the different funds. The ESF+ will support the policy priorities of the European Pillar of Social Rights which are part of its scope. The text further clarifies which Pillar rights and principles will fall under the scope of the ESF+. The question of prioritisation is clarified on pages 30-31. (5) Clarify whether and to what extent the ESF+ will address public administration reform. Refer to possible future support from other funding programmes (e.g. Structural Reform Support Programme) The text clarifies the scope of the ESF+ regarding public administration reform to the extent possible given that at the time of writing this impact assessment, the scope of the future Reform Support Programme is not yet known. (6) Identify the key changes in the delivery mechanisms of the ESF+ The changes proposed in the delivery mechanisms address different issues and are therefore of different nature. In terms of programming for example a key change is to align the funding and policy process by streamlining the programming documents. In terms of implementation, a key change is to apply in a more flexible way the territorial rules for the ESF and to introduce continuous conditionalities (Section 4). (8) Clarify the coherence between the ESF+ and ERDF and Erasmus + Aspects of coherence between the ESF+ and ERDF and Erasmus + programme have been included in the main body of the report. Additional information is provided in annex 4. (9) Explain how the monitoring system will address the criticisms voiced during the 2007-2013 period. The evaluation planning should include an interim evaluation of each fund. Explain how the stakeholders views were taken into account On monitoring and evaluation, see Main considerations, point 3. The views of stakeholders are summarised in the main body of the report (section 1.2.2) and are more detailed in annex 2, see in particular Section 6.2 which explains how stakeholder views were taken into account. The impact assessment assessed the best way to maximise the support provided at EU level and how to improve synergies between different instruments, in particular, with the aim of better delivering on the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The options assessed were the following: Option 1 : merging the ESF, YEI, FEAD, EaSI, EU Health programme. \u2013 This was the preferred option based both on the results of evaluations and on the stakeholder consultations. In the view of managing authorities, broadly integrating the funds would help streamline their strategic interventions across all areas of social policy. This would enhance flexibility when planning interventions, and facilitate the delivery of the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights. Beneficiaries confirmed that there is still untapped potential for strengthening synergies between programmes and the projects funded. Option 2: merging the ESF, YEI, FEAD, EaSI, EU Health programme and EGF ",
        "EN 11 EN \u2013 This would only result in an artificial reduction in the number of funds. The EGF's very specific objectives, high political visibility and budgetary flexibility would be lost if it were to be merged with the ESF+. Stakeholders confirmed this during the consultation process 13 . Option 3: merging the funds under shared management (i.e. excluding the EaSI and the EU Health programme, but including the EGF) \u2013 This would mean sacrificing the EGF\u2019s high visibility as an EU -level emergency instrument to cushion the adverse side effects of globalisation. The potential flexibility and synergies to be gained from merging EaSI within the ESF+ would be lost. Option 4: keeping the FEAD as a separate fund, but merging material assistance and social inclusion under the FEAD programmes. \u2013 This would allow for more synergies between the types of support for basic material assistance and social inclusion measures while keeping the current implementation rules. It would not however ensure adequate demarcation vis-\u00e0-vis ESF-type social inclusion measures. Option 5: merging all ESI Funds \u2013 This would impair policy delivery, as it would not be possible to adapt implementation rules to the specific requirements of the policies supported. It would not increase synergies and coherence with other human capital funds. \u2022 Regulatory fitness and simplification The Common Provision Regulation (common to many shared management policy areas) will ensure simplification of the shared management strand of the Fund through the use of common and simplified rules regarding programming, monitoring and evaluation arrangements, management and control, information and communication and financial management. There will be provisions facilitating the use of the simplified cost options, as well as the new option to use financing not linked to costs. The audit approach will be streamlined to focus more on risk-based audit sampling and to respect the \"single audit\" principle. The tasks and responsibilities of different bodies in the management and control system are set out in a clearer way .There will also be increased flexibility, as only the first 5 years will be programmed initially. Allocations for the last 2 years will be made based on a substantial and in-depth mid-term review leading to corresponding reprogramming in 2025. The content of programmes will be more streamlined and strategic. \u2022 Fundamental rights The ESF+ Regulation ensures the respect of fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Member States must apply this Regulation in a manner consistent with these rights and principles. 13 See study to support the impact assessment of human capital investments, DG EMPL (ongoing): \u201c The integration of EGF in framework of other DG EMPL funds was generally not deemed desirable by the different stakeholders involved in the management of EGF.\u201d ",

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The total budget allocated for the ESF+ amounts to EUR 101 billion (in current prices) for the 2021-2027 period, of which EUR 100 billion for the ESF+ strand under shared management. The financial envelope for the direct management strands of the ESF+ shall be EUR 1 174 million in current prices, of which EUR 761 million for Employment and Social Innovation and EUR 413 million for Health. Details on financial and staffing needs can be found in the ESF+ Legislative Financial Statements This proposal establishes a minimum amount for the ESF+ in order to ensure an appropriate amount of funding for investments in people in the Union. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements Under shared management, targets for common output and result indicators, and if necessary, for programme specific output and result indicators, will be defined at programme level. The Member States authorities will electronically transmit data on output and result indicators to the Commission six times a year. Their consistency will be checked. The reliability of the system for collecting, recording and storing data for monitoring, evaluation, financial management and verification will be audited. In order to simplify data collection and minimise the burden on participants and beneficiaries, the authorities will be enabled, as much as possible, to collect monitoring data from existing administrative registers. Sensitive data will not be collected directly from the participants and rely on registers or informed estimations. Evaluation will remain the shared responsibility of the Member States and the Commission. In addition to evaluations carried out by Member States, the Commission will carry out a midterm and a retrospective evaluation of the ESF+ strand under shared management with the support of the Member States. Under direct and indirect management, performance frameworks will be developed building on the relevant practices of the former EaSI and Health frameworks to ensure that data are collected efficiently, effectively and on time. The Commission will evaluate the direct and indirect management strands such that this will feed into different decision-making processes. \u2022 Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal Much of the delivery and implementation of the ESF+ strand under shared management is covered by the CPR. The main elements of the Regulation should therefore be read in conjunction with the CPR. The ESF+ Regulation has the following structure: Part I \u2013 General provisions (applicable to all strands) This part includes the subject matter, definitions, general objectives and methods of implementation and the specific objectives. It also includes provisions on the principles of gender equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination which the Commission and the Member States must respect when implementing the ESF+. This part is applicable to all ",
        "EN 13 EN strands of the ESF+. The specific objectives to be supported by the ESF+ are based on the principles set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights. Part II \u2013 Implementation under the ESF+ strand under shared management This part sets out provisions which are applicable to the strand under shared management, which includes the ex-ESF, ex-YEI and ex-FEAD. These provisions are complementary to the rules set out in the CPR. Chapter I: Common provisions on programming (under shared management) This chapter details the consistency and thematic concentration of the ESF+ strand under shared management. In particular, it provides for: \u2013 Provisions strengthening alignment with the European Semester \u2013 to strengthen the link with the European Semester, the proposal includes a new provision that if a Member State has a relevant country-specific recommendation (CSR), it should allocate an appropriate amount of its resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to this. \u2013 Thematic concentration requirements : Tackling poverty and promoting social inclusion: social inequalities remain a major concern. Therefore, at least 25% of the resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management will be allocated to fostering social inclusion to ensure that the social dimension of Europe as set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights is duly put forward and that a minimum amount of resources targets those most in need. Moreover, it is appropriate that Member States allocate a minimum amount of resources to measures addressing material deprivation. Improving employment opportunities for young people: although youth unemployment in the EU has decreased \u2013 from a peak of 24% in January 2013 to 15.6% in March 2018 \u2013 it is still high - more than double the overall unemployment rate (15.9% compared with 7.1% in February 2018). Notably, in all outermost regions, 40% of young people are unemployed. The rate of young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEET) was also still very high, at 13.4% in 2017. Therefore, Member States with a NEET rate (age group 15 \u2013 29) above a given threshold should allocate 10% of their ESF+ resources of the ESF+ strand shared management to targeted actions and structural reforms to support young people. In the case of outermost regions with a NEET rate above the threshold, the allocation is increased to 15%. Chapter II: General support of the ESF+ strand under shared management This chapter applies to all support provided by the ESF+ strand under shared management except the support addressing material deprivation. It sets out rules on eligibility and monitoring, which complement the CPR. There is also a provision on \u2018innovative actions\u2019, which encourages Member States to support social innovation and social experimentation, which strengthen bottom-up approaches based on partnerships. Chapter III: ESF+ support for addressing material deprivation ",
        "EN 14 EN Chapter III focuses solely on the ex-FEAD material assistance. This is justified by the fact that these types of operations have lower thresholds for participation and thus are less administratively burdensome. Stakeholders have called for keeping this approach and not imposing more demanding ESF rules (e.g. for reporting data on indicators, or rules on the audit trail). This chapter outlines the principles for support, the rules on reporting, eligibility, the indicators and audit. Part III \u2013 Implementation under direct and indirect management Chapter I: specific rules for the Employment and Social Innovation strand This chapter focuses on the direct and indirect management strand related to the Employment and Social Innovation strand. It includes provisions on operational objectives, eligible actions and eligible entities. Chapter II: specific provisions applicable to the Health strand This chapter focuses on the direct management strand related to the Health strand. It includes provisions on operational objectives, eligible actions and entities, and governance. Chapter III: Common rules applicable to the Employment and Social Innovation and the Health strands This chapter focuses on the rules applicable to both of the direct management strands: associated third countries, forms of EU funding and methods of implementation, work programme, monitoring and reporting,evaluation,protection of the financial interests of the Union, audits, information and communication and publicity. Part IV \u2013 Final provisions Part IV outlines the provisions applicable to all: exercise of the delegation, the Committee Procedure for the ESF+ under shared management, the Committee under Article 163 TFEU, the transitional provisions and the date of entry into force.

The twenty key principles of the pillar are structured around three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; social protection and inclusion. The twenty principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights should guide the actions under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). In order to contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights the ESF+ should support investments in people and systems in the policy areas of employment, education and social inclusion, thereby supporting economic, territorial and social cohesion in accordance with Article 174 TFEU. (2) At Union level, the European Semester of economic policy coordination is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reform priorities. Those strategies should be presented alongside the yearly National Reform Programmes as a way to outline and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by national and/or Union funding. They should also serve to use Union funding in a coherent manner and to maximise the added value of the financial support to be received notably from the programmes supported by the Union under the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund Plus, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the 14 OJ C [\u2026], [\u2026], p.

(3) The Council of [\u2026] adopted revised guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States to align the text with the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, with a view to improving Europe's competitiveness and making it a better place to invest, create jobs and foster social cohesion. In order to ensure the full alignment of the ESF+ with the objectives of these guidelines, particularly as regards employment, education, training and the fight against social exclusion, poverty and discrimination, the ESF+ should support Member States, taking account of the relevant Integrated Guidelines and relevant country-specific recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 121(2) TFEU and Article 148(4) TFEU and, where appropriate, at national level, the national reform programmes underpinned by national strategies. The ESF+ should also contribute to relevant aspects of the implementation of key Union initiatives and activities, in particular the \"Skills Agenda for Europe\" and the European Education Area, relevant Council Recommendations and other initiatives such as the Youth Guarantee, Upskilling Pathways and on Integration of the long-term unemployed. (4) On 20 June 2017, the Council endorsed the Union response to the 'UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u2019 - a sustainable European future. The Council underlined the importance of achieving sustainable development across the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental), in a balanced and integrated way. It is vital that sustainable development is mainstreamed into all Union internal and external policy areas, and that the Union is ambitious in the policies it uses to address global challenges. The Council welcomed the Commission Communication on \"Next steps for a sustainable European future\" of 22 November 2016 as a first step in mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals and applying sustainable development as an essential guiding principle for all Union policies, including through its financing instruments. (5) The Union is confronted with structural challenges arising from economic globalisation, the management of migration flows and the increased security threat, clean energy transition, technological change and an increasingly ageing workforce and growing skills and labour shortages in some sectors and regions, experienced especially by SMEs. Taking into account the changing realities of the world of work, the Union should be prepared for the current and future challenges by investing in relevant skills, making growth more inclusive and by improving employment and social policies, including in view of labour mobility. (6) Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] establishes the framework for action by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the Cohesion Fund, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMIF), Internal Security Fund (ISF) and the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) as a part of the Integrated Border Management Fund (IBMF), and lays down, in particular, the policy objectives and the rules concerning programming, monitoring and evaluation, management and control for Union funds implemented under shared management. It is therefore necessary to specify the general objectives of the ESF+, and to lay down specific provisions concerning the type of activities that may be financed by the ESF+. (7) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No [the new FR] (the \u2018Financial Regulation\u2019) lays down rules on the implementation of the Union budget, including the rules on grants, prizes, ",
        "EN 17 EN procurement, indirect implementation, financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees. In order to ensure coherence in the implementation of Union funding programmes, the Financial Regulation is to apply to the actions to be implemented in direct or indirect management under the ESF+. (8) The types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. For grants, this should include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as envisaged in Article 125(1) of the Financial Regulation. To implement measures linked to the socio-economic integration of third country nationals, and in accordance with Article 88 of the Common Provisions Regulation, the Commission may reimburse Member States using simplified cost options including the use of lump sums. (9) In order to streamline and simplify the funding landscape and create additional opportunities for synergies through integrated funding approaches, the actions which were supported by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived ('FEAD'), the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation and the Programme for the Union's action in the field of health should be integrated into one ESF+. The ESF+ should therefore include three strands: the ESF+ strand under shared management, the Employment and Social Innovation strand, and the Health strand. This should contribute to reducing the administrative burden linked to the management of different funds, in particular for Member States, whilst maintaining simpler rules for simpler operations such as the distribution of food and/or basic material assistance. (10) In view of this wider scope of the ESF+ it is appropriate to foresee that the aims to enhance the effectiveness of labour markets and promote access to quality employment, to improve the access to and the quality of education and training as well as to promote social inclusion and health and to reduce poverty are not only implemented under shared management, but also under direct and indirect management under the Employment and Social Innovation and Health strands for actions required at Union level. (11) The integration of the Programme for the Union's action in the field of health with the ESF+ will also create synergies between the developments and testing of initiatives and policies to improve the effectiveness, resilience and sustainability of health systems developed by the Health strand of the ESF+ Programme and their implementation in the Member States by the tools provided by the other strands of the ESF+ Regulation. (12) This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the ESF+. Parts of this financial envelope should be used for actions to be implemented in direct and indirect management under the Employment and Social Innovation and Health strands. (13) The ESF+ should aim to promote employment through active interventions enabling (re)integration into the labour market, notably for youth, the long-term unemployed and the inactive, as well as through promoting self \u2013 employment and the social economy. The ESF+ should aim to improve the functioning of labour markets by supporting the modernisation of labour market institutions such as the Public Employment Services in order to improve their capacity to provide intensified targeted counselling and guidance during the job search and the transition to employment and ",
        "EN 18 EN to enhance workers\u2019 mobility. The ESF+ should promote women's participation in the labour market through measures aiming to ensure, amongst others, improved work/life balance and access to childcare. The ESF + should also aim to provide a healthy and well-adapted working environment in order to respond to health risks related to changing forms of work and the needs of the ageing workforce. (14) The ESF+ should provide support to improving the quality, effectiveness and labour market relevance of education and training systems in order to facilitate the acquisition of key competences notably as regards digital skills which all individuals need for personal fulfilment and development, employment, social inclusion and active citizenship. The ESF+ should help progression within education and training and transition to work, support lifelong learning and employability, and contribute to competitiveness and societal and economic innovation by supporting scalable and sustainable initiatives in these fields. This could be achieved for example through work-based learning and apprenticeships, lifelong guidance, skills anticipation in cooperation with industry, up-to-date training materials, forecasting and graduate tracking, training of educators, validation of learning outcomes and recognition of qualifications. (15) Support through the ESF+ should be used to promote equal access for all, in particular for disadvantaged groups, to quality, non-segregated and inclusive education and training, from early childhood education and care through general and vocational education and training and to tertiary level, as well as adult education and learning, thereby fostering permeability between education and training sectors, preventing early school leaving, improving health literacy, reinforcing links with non-formal and informal learning and facilitating learning mobility for all. Synergies with the Erasmus programme, notably to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged learners in learning mobility, should be supported within this context. (16) The ESF+ should promote flexible upskilling and reskilling opportunities for all, notably digital skills and key enabling technologies, with a view to providing people with skills adjusted to digitalisation, technological change, innovation and social and economic change, facilitating career transitions, mobility and supporting in particular low-skilled and/or poorly qualified adults, in line with the Skills Agenda for Europe. (17) Synergies with the Horizon Europe programme should ensure that the ESF+ can mainstream and scale up innovative curricula supported by Horizon Europe in order to equip people with the skills and competences needed for the jobs of the future. (18) The ESF+ should support Member States\u2019 efforts to tackle poverty with a view to breaking the cycle of disadvantage across generations and promote social inclusion by ensuring equal opportunities for all, tackling discrimination and addressing health inequalities. This implies mobilising a range of policies targeting the most disadvantaged people regardless of their age, including children, marginalised communities such as the Roma, and the working poor. The ESF+ should promote the active inclusion of people far from the labour market with a view to ensuring their socio-economic integration. The ESF+ should be also used to enhance timely and equal access to affordable, sustainable and high quality services such as healthcare and long-term care, in particular family and community-based care services. The ESF+ should contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems with a view in particular to promoting their accessibility. (19) The ESF+ should contribute to the reduction of poverty by supporting national schemes aiming to alleviate food and material deprivation and promote social ",
        "EN 19 EN integration of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion and the most deprived. With a view that at Union level at least 4% of the resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management supports the most deprived, Member States should allocate at least 2% of their national resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to address the forms of extreme poverty with the greatest social exclusion impact, such as homelessness, child poverty and food deprivation. Due to the nature of the operations and the type of end recipients, it is necessary that simpler rules apply to support which addresses material deprivation of the most deprived. (20) In light of the persistent need to enhance efforts to address the management of the migration flows in the Union as a whole and in order to ensure a coherent, strong and consistent support to the solidarity and responsibility-sharing efforts, the ESF+ should provide support to promote the socio-economic integration of third country nationals complementary to the actions financed under the Asylum and Migration Fund. (21) The ESF+ should support policy and system reforms in the fields of employment, social inclusion, healthcare and long-term care, and education and training. In order to strengthen alignment with the European Semester, Member States should allocate an appropriate amount of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to implement relevant country-specific recommendations relating to structural challenges which it is appropriate to address through multiannual investments falling within the scope of the ESF+. The Commission and the Member States should ensure coherence, coordination and complementarity between the shared-management and Health strands of ESF+ and the Reform Support Programme, including the Reform Delivery Tool and the Technical Support Instrument. In particular, the Commission and the Member State should ensure, in all stages of the process, effective coordination in order to safeguard the consistency, coherence, complementarity and synergy among sources of funding, including technical assistance thereof. (22) To ensure that the social dimension of Europe as set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights is duly put forward and that a minimum amount of resources is targeting those most in need Member States should allocate at least 25% of their national ESF+ resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to fostering social inclusion. (23) In the light of persistently high levels of youth unemployment and inactivity in a number of Member States and regions, in particular affecting young people who are neither in employment, nor in education or training, it is necessary that those Member States continue to invest sufficient resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management towards actions to promote youth employment including through the implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes. Building on the actions supported by the Youth Employment Initiative in the 2014-2020 programming period targeting individual persons, Member States should further promote employment and education reintegration pathways and outreach measures for young people by prioritising, where relevant, long-term unemployed, inactive and disadvantaged young people including through youth work. Member States should also invest in measures aimed at facilitating school-to-work transition as well as reforming and adapting employment services with a view to providing tailor-made support to young people. Member States concerned should therefore allocate at least 10% of their national resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to support youth employability.

(26) Efficient and effective implementation of actions supported by the ESF+ depends on good governance and partnership between all actors at the relevant territorial levels and the socio-economic actors, in particular the social partners and civil society. It is therefore essential that Member States encourage the participation of social partners and civil society in the implementation of the ESF+ under shared management. (27) With a view to rendering policies more responsive to social change and to encourage and support innovative solutions, support for social innovation is crucial. In particular, testing and evaluating innovative solutions before scaling them up is instrumental in improving the efficiency of the policies and thus justifies specific support from the ESF+. (28) The Member States and the Commission should ensure that ESF+ contributes to the promotion of equality between women and men in accordance with Article 8 TFEU to foster equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men in all areas, including regarding participation in the labour market, terms and conditions of employment and career progression. They should also ensure that the ESF+ promotes equal opportunities for all, without discrimination in accordance with Article 10 TFEU and promotes the inclusion in society of persons with disabilities on equal basis with others and contributes to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These principles should be taken into account in all dimensions and in all stages of the preparation, monitoring, implementation and evaluation of programmes, in a timely and consistent manner while ensuring that specific actions are taken to promote gender equality and equal opportunities. The ESF+ should also promote the transition from residential/institutional care to family and community-based care, in particular for those who face multiple discrimination. The ESF+ should not support any action that contributes to segregation or to social exclusion.Regulation (EU) No [future CPR] provides that rules on eligibility of expenditure are to be established at national level, with certain exceptions for which it is necessary to lay down specific provisions with regard to the ESF+ strand under shared management.

The European network of employment services should promote a better functioning of the labour markets by facilitating the cross-border mobility of workers and a greater transparency of information on the labour markets. The ESF+ scope also includes developing and supporting targeted mobility schemes with a view to filling vacancies where labour market shortcomings have been identified. (33) Lack of access to finance for microenterprises, social economy and social enterprises is one of the main obstacles to business creation, especially among people furthest from the labour market. The ESF+ Regulation lays down provisions in order to create a market eco-system to increase the supply of and access to finance for social enterprises as well as to meet demand from those who need it most, and in particular the unemployed, women and vulnerable people who wish to start up or develop a microenterprise. This objective will also be addressed through financial instruments and budgetary guarantee under the social investment and skills policy window of the InvestEU Fund. (34) Social investment market players, including philanthropic actors, can play a key role in achieving several ESF+ objectives, as they offer financing as well as innovative and complementary approaches to combatting social exclusion and poverty, reducing unemployment and contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, philanthropic actors such as foundations and donors should be involved, as appropriate, in ESF+ actions in particular in those aimed at developing the social investment market ecosystem. (35) In accordance with Article 168 TFEU, a high level of human health protection is to be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. The Union is to complement and support national health policies, encourage cooperation between Member States and promote the coordination between their programmes, in full respect of the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policies and the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. (36) Keeping people healthy and active longer and empowering them to take an active role in managing their health will have positive effects on health, health inequalities, quality of life, productivity, competitiveness and inclusiveness, while reducing pressures on national budgets.

(39) Non-communicable diseases are responsible for over 80 % of premature mortality in the Union and an effective prevention entails multiple cross border dimensions. In parallel, the European Parliament and the Council underlined the need to minimise the public health consequences of serious cross-border threats to health such as communicable diseases and other biological, chemical, environmental and unknown threats, by supporting preparedness and response capacity building.

(42) Given the specific nature of some of the objectives covered by the Health strand of the ESF+ and by the type of the actions under that strand, the respective competent authorities of the Member States are best placed to implement the related activities. Those authorities, designated by the Member States themselves, should therefore be considered to be identified beneficiaries for the purpose of Article [195]of [the new Financial Regulation] and the grants be awarded to such authorities without prior publication of calls for proposals.

Title of the proposal/initiative [Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund + and repealing Regulations (EU) No. 1296/2013, (EU) No. 1304/2013 and (EU) No. 223/2014] 1.2.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.4.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative The ESF+ is the main EU instrument to invest in people and makes a significant contribution to a more social Europe, bringing Europe close to the citizens and delivering every day results for the people who are most in need in our societies. The ESF+ contributes to increasing socio-econcomic convergence between Member States which is a necessary condition for the proper functionning of the EU as a stable and viable economic and political union. Following the adoption of the ESF+ Regulation Member States will programme their budgetary allocations in line with guidance received in the context of the European Semester in the previous year. The new programming period will start on 1 January 2021 and the Commission has taken measures to speed up the Fund\u2019 s implementation as much as possible, for example by dropping the requirement to notify the designation of Managing authorities to the Commission, thus avoiding the delays of the 2014-2020 period. Implementation in direct management will also start immediately after the entry inot force of the programme. 1.4.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting 33 As referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation. ",
        "EN 49 EN from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. Reasons for action at European level (ex-ante): EU added value is generated by providing investments in areas and target groups that would not take place otherwise, by widening the scope of existing actions, supporting the mainstreaming of innovations and by enhancing the capacity of Member States administrations. Ample evidence demonstrates that EU policies aiming at promoting social cohesion and social rights would not have been implemented without complementary EU investment. Thanks to European funding, Member States have invested in areas, targert groups and reforms in a way that would have been impossible with national funding only. While the competence to deal with employment and social affairs rests mainly at national level, given the scale and effect of the challenges, action has proven more effective and efficient if the EU level supports the efforts made by Member States and helps promote reforms beneficial to individual countries and the EU as a whole. Expected generated Union added value (ex-post): The challenges faced by European economies and societies in particular as regards employment, education, skills and social issues call for continued investments in these areas. The initiative is expected to contribute to implement EU policies and priorities in these areas (such as the employment guidelines and the European pillar of social rights), promote best practices and cooperation (to improve policy-making and implementation capacity, facilitate transantional cooperation) and promote EU values (such as equality and social justice). In the long term, the initiative is expected to contribute to the socio- economic convergence of Member States and to make the European economy and societies more resilient. 1.4.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past Evaluations of current and previous programming periods and related studies all confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, EU added value and coherence of the funds covered by this Regulation. Member States have invested in policy areas, target groups and reforms in a way that would not have been possible with national funding only. In particular: \u2022 the 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 ESF ex-post evaluations recognise ESF investments as relevant, efficient and effective. The ESF's alignment with EU policies and priorities under the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth was strengthened over time. At the same time, being one of the structural funds, the ESF contributes to the Treaty's goals of economic, social and territorial cohesion through increased concentration of resources. For example, the ESF (with the associated national funding) accounts for 70 % of active measures in 11 Member States. \u2022 through its support for young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) in specific EU regions, the YEI raised the visibility of youth employment policies, but also brought about a shift in policy-making in a number of Member States by supporting the setting-up and implementation of youth guarantee schemes; \u2022 preliminary results of the FEAD mid-term evaluation, including feedback from stakeholders, indicate that the food, material aid and social inclusion operations that it has supported make a difference to the most deprived, including those who might otherwise be left out of mainstream social assistance or who need immediate support; ",
        "EN 50 EN \u2022 the mid-term evaluation of the EaSI shows that its objectives are still relevant, in particular in a challenging socio-economic context characterised by the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis and that it was effective in reaching the relevant stakeholders, generating outcomes and achieving its objectives. However, evaluations and studies also provide evidence of a number of challenges, mostly regarding the need for greater coherence and synergy, flexibility and policy alignment, performance and results orientation, and simplification. In particular the funding landscape and, to a greater or lesser degree, the implementation of the funds, need to be simplified. The areas to be addressed are summarised in the Impact Assessment accompanying the legislative proposal. 1.4.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments The initiative aims at improving synergies and coherence between ESF+ and other funds investing in human capital development. With the ERDF the ESF+ shares in particular the objective of economic and social cohesion. Coordination is ensured through common rules for shared management in areas such as programming and financial managament. Multi-fund programmes will continue to be possible to allow integrated approaches in programming and implementation. Common rules will also ensure compatibility between ERDF, ESF+ and EAFRD and EMFF programmes. The ESF+ and Erasmus+ cooperation will be supported more actively by including suitable provisions in the regulations to be worked out in detail in work programmes and programme guides. The ESF + will continue to support the long term integration of migrants while the AMIF will cover short term needs. As the main EU instrument for investing in human capital and skills, the ESF+ will continue to make an important contribution to human capital development in research and innovation (R&I) in synergy with Horizon Europe.

Besides the new transnational cooperation activities foreseen might be implemented under indirect management, relying on ESF managing authorities. 34 Details of management modes and references to the Financial Regulation may be found on the BudgWeb site: https://myintracomm.ec.europa.eu/budgweb/EN/man/budgmanag/Pages/budgmanag.aspx ",
        "EN 52 EN 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules Specify frequency and conditions. Under shared management, common outputs and result indicators will be defined at programme level. Data on common output and result indicators will be transmitted electronically by the Member States authorities to the Commission 6 times a year. Their consistency will be checked. The reliability of the system for collecting, recording and storing data for monitoring, evaluation, financial management and verification will be audited. Under Direct and indirect management, performance frameworks will be developed building on the relevant practices of the former EaSI and Health frameworks to ensure that data is collected efficiently, effectively and timely. 2.2. Management and control system(s) 2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed The Draft CPR foresees payments from the Commission taking the form of pre- financing, interim payments and payments following the cleareance of accounts.The prefinancing is paid annually following the percentages forseen in the CPR. Interim payments are calculated following the agreed co-financing rates by priority agreed in the operational programme. Unlike for the current programming period, the number of interim payment applications is limitted to 4 per year submitted on a quarterly basis. The draft CPR foresees different modalities for disclosing interim payments depending on whether the implementation of the programme is based either on the real costs declared by the Member State or based on \"simplified costs option\" or upon the achievement of conditions. The draft CPR proposal (shared management) builds on the one in place for the 2014-2020 programming period. However, there are certain measures proposed that aim at simplifying the implementation and at reducing the audit burden upon Member States and their beneficiaries. These measures are related to both the management of the funds by the Managing Authority which, as proposed, shall base the management verifications on a risk analysis. Secondly, under certain conditions, the Managing Authority may decide to apply enhanced control arrangements in line with national procedures without prior authorisation from the Commission. Also, the designation process has been deleted which should speed up the implementation of the programmes. The draft proposal for CPR does not forsee a Certifying Authority but rather the presence of an accounting function. The reasoning behind this is that it would lead to less administration at national level. As far as the audit of declared expenditure is concerned, the CPR proposal contains certain elements that aim at avoiding multiple audits for the same operation/expenditure. Under the draft CPR rules, interim payments will be certified to the Commission after management checks - on a risk based sample of expenditure claims submitted ",
        "EN 53 EN by beneficiaries - have been carried out, but frequently before on the spot in-depth management checks or subsequent audit activities took place. In order to mitigate the risk of reimbursing ineligible expenses due to this, a number of measures have been foreseen in the proposals 1) Interim payments by the Commission continue to be capped at 90% of the amount due to Member States, as at this point only part of the national controls have been carried out. The remaining balance will be paid following the annual clearance of accounts once audit evidence and reasonable assurance has been provided by the managing authority and the audit authority. Any irregularities detected by the Commission or the European Court of Auditors after the transmission of annual certified accounts by the managing/certifying authority may lead to a net correction. 2) continuation of an annual clearance of accounts and of an annual closure of completed operations or expenditure , which will create additional incentives for national and regional authorities to undertake quality controls in a timely manner in view of the annual certification of accounts to the Commission. The Health and Employment and Social Innovation strand of the programme will be implemented through direct and indirect management, using the implementation modes offered by the Financial Regulation, mainly being grants and procurement. Direct management allows to establish direct contacts with beneficiaries/contractors directly engaged in activities that serve Union policies. The Commission ensures direct monitoring over the outcome of the actions financed. The payment modalities of the actions funded will be adapted to the risks pertaining to the financial transactions. In order to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the Commission controls, the strategy will be oriented towards a balance of ex-ante and ex-post checks. Regarding direct and indirect management Ex-post audits will also be carried out on- the-spot by external auditors for a sample of transactions. The selection of these transactions will combine a risk assessment and and a random selection. 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them The reduced control environment may lead to an increase in error. It is anticipated that this risk is mitigated by the capping of reimbursements and by the annual clearance of accounts. It is however likely that corrections at national level will be higher, thus leading to a degree of frustration at Member State level. This frustration may also be fueled by the fact that the current drafting of the CPR actually obliges the Managing Authorities to carry out controls on a risk based approach rather than on the 100% basis as in the past. This requirement may also be in conflict with existing national legislation that requires an exhaustive verification of costs declared (also for the national matching funding). This may be an element which has not been sufficiently considered in the proposal. The elimination of the Certifying Authority reduces an extra filter in the management and control of the incurred expenditure. During the previous two programming periods, Certifying Authorities played an important role in filtering out ineligible expenditure and in making additional financial corrections where needed. The current CPR proposal does not mitigate this risk. ",
        "EN 54 EN The reduced audit work may lead to non-identification of residual errors and may hence undermine the assurance process of the Commission. In our view, this risk is not mitigated, especially since the proportionate control arrangements also limit the Commission's powers in respect of auditing. We consider therefore that this risk is accepted by the legislator. As regards the budget implemented through direct and indirect management, the implementation focuses on the attribution of public procurement contracts while a number of grants for specific activities and organisations are foreseen. The public procurement contracts will mainly be concluded in areas such as studies, data collection, evaluation contracts, training, information campaigns, IT and communication services, facilities management etc. The contractors are mainly consultancy firms and other private companies of which many SMEs; in the Health strand, there are institutes and laboratories as well as main contractors. Grants will mainly be awarded for support activities to non-governmental organisations, national agencies, universities etc. The period of execution of the subsidised projects and activities varies from one to three years mostly. The main risks are the following: \u2022 Risk of inefficient or non -economic use of funds awarded, both for grants (complexity of funding rules, especially for small operators) and for procurement (limited number of economic providers with the required specialist knowledge entailing insufficient possibilities to compare price offers in some sectors); \u2022 Reputational risk for the Commission, if fraud or criminal activities are discovered; only partial assurance can be drawn from the third parties' internal control systems due to the rather large number of heterogeneous contractors and beneficiaries, each operating their own control system, often rather small in size. The Commission put in place internal procedures that aim at covering the risks identified above. The internal procedures are in full compliance with the Financial Regulation and include anti-fraud measures and cost-benefit considerations. Within this framework, the Commission continues to explore possibilities to enhance the management and to realise efficiency gains. Main features of the control framework are the following: Controls before and during the implementation of the projects: \u2022 Model grant agreements and service contracts are being used, developed within the Commission. They provide for a number of control provisions such as audit certificates, financial guarantees, on-site audits as well as inspections by OLAF. The rules governing the eligibility of costs are being simplified, for example, by using unit costs, lump sums, contributions not linked to costs and other possibilities offered by the Financial Regulation. This will reduce the cost of controls and put the focus on checks and controls in high risk areas. \u2022 All staff sign up to the code of good administrative behaviour. Staff who are involved in the selection procedure or in the management of the grant agreements/contracts (also) sign a declaration of absence of a conflict of interest. Staff is regularly trained and uses networks to exchange best practices. \u2022 Technical implementation of a project is checked at regular intervals at the desk on the basis of technical progress reports of the contractors and beneficiaries; in addition ",
        "EN 55 EN contractors'/beneficiaries' meetings and on-site-visits are foreseen on a case by case basis. Controls at the end of the project: Ex-post audits are performed to verify on-the- spot the eligibility of cost claims. The aim of these controls is to prevent, detect and correct material errors related to the legality and regularity of financial transactions. With a view to achieving a high control impact, the selection of beneficiaries to be audited foresees to combine a risk based selection with a random sampling, and to pay attention to operational aspects whenever possible during the on-site audit. 2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of \"control costs \u00f7 value of the related funds managed\"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) The option to have an accounting function, which could allow the Member State to save a substantial part of the 4% of the current costs relating to certification due to a reduction in the functions of the management and control systems; -the use of simplified costs and SCOs not linked to costs, which reduces administrative costs and burdens at all levels, for both administrations and beneficiaries; -proportionate control arrangements for management verifications (risk based) and for audits; -annual closure, which will reduce the cost of retention of documents for control purposes for public administrations and beneficiaries. Therefore overall it is expected that proposals will lead to a redistribution of control costs (remaining around 2% of the total funding managed), rather than an increase or a reduction. Against the background of the experience gained with the implementation of the previous (strands of the) programme in direct management and the main design features of the new programme, the risks of the programme implementation are assessed to remain relatively stable. Thanks to the combination of grants and procurement, ex-ante and ex-post controls as well as desk checks and on-site audits, the quantifiable average residual error rate is expected to remain below 2%. For direct and indirect management, the yearly cost of the suggested level of controls represents approximately 4 to 7% of the yearly budget of the operational expenditure. This is justified by the high amount of transactions to be controlled. Indeed, in the area of employment and social affairs and health, direct management involve the attribution of numerous contracts and grants for actions, and the payment of numerous operating grants to non-governmental organisations and trade unions. The risk related to these activities concerns the capacity of (especially) smaller organisations to effectively control expenditure. On a 5 years basis, the error rate for the on-the-spot audits of grants under direct management was 1.8%. and globally taking into account the low risk level for procurement below 1 %. This level of error is considered acceptable, as it is under the materiality level of 2%. The proposed changes for the programme will not affect the way the appropriations are currently managed. The existing control system proved to be able to prevent and/or to detect errors and/or irregularities, and in case of errors or irregularities, to ",
        "EN 56 EN correct them. Therefore, historical error rates are expected to remain at the same levels. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy. As for its activities in direct, indirect and shared management, the Commission shall take appropriate measures ensuring that the financial interests of the European Union are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the amounts wrongly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportional and deterrent penalties. The Commission or its representatives and the Court of Auditors shall have the power of audit, on the basis of documents and on-the-spot, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors and subcontractors who have received Union funds. OLAF shall be authorised to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by such funding. The Commission also implements a series of measures such as: - decisions, agreements and contracts resulting from the implementation of the programme will expressly entitle the Commission, including OLAF, and the Court of Auditors to conduct audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections; - during the evaluation phase of a call for proposals/tender, the applicants and tenderers are checked against the published exclusion criteria based on declarations and the Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES); - the rules governing the eligibility of costs will be simplified in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation; - regular training on issues related to fraud and irregularities is given to all staff involved in contract management as well as to auditors and controllers who verify the beneficiaries' declarations on the spot. DG EMPL pursues actions in the framework of the Commission\u2019s Anti -Fraud Strategy (CAFS). In the case of direct management, the Fraud-Risk-Assessment (FRA) was updated in 2016. The procedure to award grants comprises several fraud-detection elements, such as the widespread use of the 4-eyes principle, verifying the correctness and transparency of award procedures, having detailed procedures to avoid conflicts of interests, verifying whether applicants have been \u2018blacklisted\u2019 pursuant to Regulation 1605/2002, use of IT- tools like EDES and ARACHNE and looking out for other \u2018red flags\u2019 (fraud indicators). In the case of the shared management of Structural Funds there is the more specific Joint Anti-Fraud Strategy (JAFS) 2015-2020 of DG Regional and Urban Policy, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and DG Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. For the Structural Funds there is a specific regulatory anti-fraud requirement for 2014-2020 in the Common Provisions Regulation (Article 125(4)c CPR). DG EMPL through it control and audit obligations verifies that the Member States have set up, and effectively run management and control systems which make sure funds are efficiently and correctly used so as to ensure legality and regularity of expenditure. ",
        "EN 57 EN Member States are obliged to notify problems through the Irregularity Management System (IMS). DG EMPL tracks the national actions to combat fraud and if necessary sanctions a lack of action by Financial Correction Decisions regarding the ESF support granted to the programme concerned, for example in the framework of the follow-up to OLAF reports and recommendations. In addition, DG EMPL provides guidance to managing authorities, including a fraud risk assessment tool. DG EMPL actively disseminates the ARACHNE risk scoring tool to Member States. Following a study by an external contractor that is to be finalised in mid-2018, the JAFS will be reviewed and DG EMPL\u2019s contribution to the CAFS updated. Finally, horizontal measures like internal training regarding fraud-awareness (red flags) and fraud-prevention round-off the measures taken by DG EMPL. ",

        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal Education, training and youth have recently come to the forefront of EU Leaders' attention. In the Rome Declaration, of 25 March 2017, they called for \" a Union where citizens have new opportunities for cultural and social development and economic growth \" and pledged to work towards \" a Union where young people receive the best education and training and can study and find jobs across the continent. \" In its resolution of 14 September 2017 'on the future of the Erasmus+ programme', the European Parliament emphasised that the future programme should ultimately be targeted towards all young people and that these higher ambitions for the next programming period should be reflected in an increased budget so as to unlock the full potential of the programme. In the context of the Social Summit in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission solemnly proclaimed and signed the European Pillar of Social Rights, which sets out, as its first principle, that everyone has the right to quality and inclusive education, training and lifelong learning in order to maintain and acquire skills that enable them to participate fully in society and manage successfully transitions in the labour market. In its conclusions of 14 December 2017, the European Council highlighted the importance of the social, educational and cultural dimension of Union policies in bringing Europeans together and building our common future, and called on Member States, the Council and the Commission, in line with their respective competences, to take work forward with a view to stepping up mobility and exchanges, including through a substantially strengthened, inclusive and extended programme. In its Communication of 14 February 2018 on 'A new, modern Multiannual Financial Framework for a Union that delivers efficiently on its priorities post-2020' 1 , the Commission highlighted that the Union budget will need to deliver on the promises made by Union Leaders, including through the full implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, and supporting young people and the mobility of European citizens. The Communication also underlined the strong consensus on the need to step up mobility and exchanges, including through a substantially strengthened, inclusive and extended Erasmus+, and underlined that the programme equips young people with labour market skills, improves cultural understanding and strengthens the social fabric of the Union. In its Communication on 'A modern budget for a Union that protects, empowers and defends - the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027' 2 adopted on 2 May 2018, the Commission proposed \" a stronger \u201cyouth\u201d focus in the next financial framework. This will be achieved by more than doubling the size of Erasmus+ (\u2026), one of the Union\u2019s most visible success stories .\" The focus of the new Programme \" will be on inclusiveness, and to reach more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. This will allow more young people to move to another country to learn or work .\" The Commission thus proposed \" a more powerful Erasmus programme which will reach a size of EUR 30 billion over the period\" . It also proposes to include an amount of EUR 700 million for a new initiative \"DiscoverEU\" which will offer young people the opportunity to discover other EU countries. 1 COM(2018) 98 final. 2 COM(2018) 321 final. ",
        "EN 2 EN The ambition for the next programme (hereinafter referred to as 'the Programme') goes hand in hand with the Commission's vision to work towards a European Education Area by 2025 as set out in its Communication on 'Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture' of 14 November 2017 3 . The European Education Area stands for \" a Europe in which learning would not be hampered by borders. A continent where spending time in another Member State - to study, to learn and to work - has become the standard and where, in addition to one's mother tongue, speaking two other languages has become the norm. A continent in which people have a strong sense of their identity as Europeans, of Europe's cultural heritage and its diversity \". The Programme will be a key component supporting the work towards a European Education Area. The aim is to boost the tried-and-tested Programme in all categories of learners, whether taking part in higher education, general education, vocational education and training and adult education or in non-formal learning, youth and active participation activities. Increasing the accessibility of the Programme to a wider number of individuals means an increased financial investment in the Programme but also, and very importantly, a mix of measures, rules and modalities of participation that allow to do economies of scale, introduce simplification to alleviate the administrative burden, thus removing obstacles to mobility and increasing the relevance, attractiveness and inclusive character of the Programme. The goal is to triple the number of participants while at the same time introducing qualitative measures and incentives that would allow to improve outreach to learners with fewer opportunities. Europeans need to be equipped with the skills needed in a society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. There is a clear need to address this challenge and invest in activities that provide individuals with the right set of knowledge, skills and competences, including languages, from a lifelong learning perspective. This will help to make them more resilient and employable as well as foster social cohesion. Europe also needs more investments in digital skills and forward-looking fields, such as climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analysis, arts/design, etc. These are all essential fields for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. Focused actions will help the Union unleash its potential for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship in the digital economy. Supporting culture and creativity in education will contribute to increased resilience of European society. To increase the qualitative impact of the current programme, the future Programme should reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It should reach out more to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants as well as Union citizens living in remote areas. For school pupils, learning mobility experiences have been an exception so far. As regards higher education students, trainees, apprentices, young people in general, the current programme is unable to satisfy the large and growing demand in participating in learning mobility activities. Hence, further efforts are needed to make the Programme more inclusive and further increase its efficiency, building on the excellent results achieved over the past thirty years by Union programmes in this field. This will be done notably by increasing and facilitating mobility activities for school pupils, vocational learners, apprentices and youth. For all types of mobility activities, the level of grant support should be optimised, including by ensuring higher grants for certain categories of students and learners, including in higher education mobility. Mobility opportunities for youth participating in non-formal learning activities will be extended to reach more young people.

The Programme should also reach out to a larger target group both within and beyond the Union by a greater use of information, communication and technology tools, blended mobility (a combination of physical and virtual mobility) and virtual cooperation. To make the Programme more inclusive and in particular to address the needs of certain target groups, such as adult learners, more flexible learning mobility formats, such as short term, group or virtual mobility, will be promoted. Best practices on inclusion in the youth field could be expanded to other fields. A specific action \u2013 small scale partnerships - would be designed to make the Programme accessible to organisations with little or no experience or with smaller operational capacity, in particular for grassroots organisations and those organisations that work with people with fewer opportunities. The Programme will address the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and the low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters that have an impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the Union's political and social life. Moreover, although 70% of Europeans feel they are citizens of the Union today, with the percentage even higher among the younger generations, there is a widespread lack of awareness and understanding of what the European Union is, how it works and what added value it has for its citizens 4 . Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the Union's future. The Programme can contribute to raising awareness and knowledge of the European Union among more people than it has done so far. Organisations and institutions active in the fields of education, training, youth and sport have a key role to play in the development of civic education and in building knowledge about Union matters at large. When looking at young Europeans' understanding of the European Union, they have little knowledge beyond basic facts 5 . Almost nine in ten young people in the Union believe that there should be stronger school education about rights and responsibilities as a citizen of the Union 6 . At the same time, the coverage of teaching about the European Union in national curricula is very fragmented and the active participation dimension is mostly missing 7 . There is also a general need to empower people to become more active in society, willing and capable to participate fully in society and in the democratic life of Europe. Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is instrumental to achieving the goals and address the challenges described above. Cooperation between organisations and institutions is a catalyst for innovative ways to support learners in their personal, educational and professional development. It brings concrete positive effects for individuals, for example 4 70% of Europeans now feel that they are citizens of the European Union, a slight increase of two percentage points since 2017 and the highest score recorded since spring 2010. More than half the respondents (54%) know their rights as EU citizens, but more than two thirds would like to know more (Standard Eurobarometer 88 on EU citizenship from November 2017).

It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise, thus contributing to a high quality education. However, the intensity and capacity of cooperation activities spawned by the current Erasmus+ programme remain insufficient, especially among small and grass-roots organisations. The degree of cooperation varies across countries and regions, and across sectors. There is room for improvement regarding the participation of schools, adult learning establishments and youth associations. This situation hampers institutional reforms and the modernisation of education, training and youth systems at national and European level. The international dimension of the Programme is a fundamental and cross-cutting element which is relevant for mobility, cooperation as well as for policy dialogue activities. There is, in particular, a need to intensify international mobility and cooperation with third countries - in particular enlargement, neighbourhood, industrialised and emerging countries - in order to support institutions and organisations in Europe in facing the challenges of globalisation. At the same time, it is key to ensure synergies with the Union's external instruments to pursue the goals of its external actions to contribute to human and institutional development in third countries, including in developing countries, and to engage with their young people, as an essential element to building more resilient societies and enhancing trust between cultures. The Programme will have to tackle cross-cutting issues which concern all Union programmes, such as simplifying access to the Programme to the widest possible range of target groups (e.g., simpler rules and administrative procedures, and optimised online tools) while ensuring a competitive and transparent selection of projects, a correct grant-management cycle with minimised financial risks for the Union. In addition, the implementation modalities of the international strand should be made simpler, in order to increase accessibility to the action. This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of twenty seven Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and Euratom based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions The Programme is one of the funding instruments under the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework aiming at investing in people, social cohesion and values. It is a key instrument at Union level which funds activities at European level in support of learning mobility, cooperation and innovative policy developments in the fields of education, training youth and sport. The policies of the Union in the field of education, training, youth and sport consist of working towards a European Education Area, while promoting the overall strategic framework for European cooperation in the field of education and training, and its underlying sectoral agendas on school, vocational education and training, higher education and adult education, advancing youth policy cooperation under the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 and developing the European dimension in sport, in particular grassroots sport. The Programme is a key instrument supporting the implementation of these Union policies, thereby contributing to sustainable growth, jobs and social cohesion and strengthening European identity, as outlined in the Programme objectives. In particular, the Programme will support (a) school development and excellent teaching; (b) the Copenhagen process on vocational education and training; (c) the renewed EU agenda for higher education and the Bologna process; (d) the renewed EU agenda for adult learning; (e) ",
        "EN 5 EN the renewed EU youth strategy and (f) the EU work plan for sport. These policies will continue to rely on the support from the integrated lifelong learning approach of the Programme. In addition, the Programme will contribute to the implementation of the New Skills Agenda for Europe with a shared commitment to the strategic importance of skills for sustaining jobs, growth and competitiveness. It also supports Member States in reaching the goals set out in the Paris Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education from 17 March 2015. The Programme will also contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, in particular to the Sustainable Development Goal number 4 to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies and programmes The Programme will be consistent with and complementary to other Union instruments, in particular the external cooperation instruments 8 , the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) 9 , the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF). The Union Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy of June 2016 and the European Consensus for Development adopted by Council on 19 May 2017 underline the importance of education and human development as instruments to address concerns linked to demographic trends outside the Union. Actions in the area of education, training and youth policies are also crucial to address migration challenges and prevent risk of radicalisation and extremism. In this respect, the Programme will seek synergies with the Asylum Migration Fund as well as with the Internal Security Fund 10 . There are also important potential complementarities between the objectives and interventions of the Programme and the future Rights and Values programme. The latter aims at promoting and increasing awareness of citizens about our common history, and at enhancing democratic participation of citizens at Union level. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. The contribution of this programme to the achievement of this overall target will be tracked through an EU climate marker system at an appropriate level of disaggregation, including the use of more precise methodologies where these are available. The Commission will continue to present the information annually in terms of commitment appropriations in the context of the annual draft budget. To support the full utilisation of the potential of the programme to contribute to climate objectives, the Commission will seek to identify relevant actions throughout the programme preparation, implementation, review and evaluation processes. The Programme will be consistent with and constitute an important complement to the future Creative Europe programme 11 . Cooperation between institutions and organisations active in education, training and youth, supported by Erasmus, will help equip individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to face social and economic challenges as well as fulfil their potential for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, in particular within the 8 the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA III). 9 The European Regional and Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. 10 [Reference]. 11 COM(2018) 366.

Activities linked to reinforcing all aspects of creativity in education and enhancing individual key competencies, will constitute a major link between the two programmes in line with the New Agenda for Culture 12 . In the field of youth, the Programme will also be consistent with, and complement the European Solidarity Corps by offering different types of activities. The European Solidarity Corps aims at enhancing the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high quality solidarity activities, while the proposed Erasmus Programme will offer other types of activities, such as transnational learning mobility, youth participation activities, measures to enhance cooperation among organisations and activities aiming at supporting policy development. Both programmes have common governance and delivery mechanisms. In the field of research and innovation, the Programme will ensure synergies with Horizon Europe. Notably, the latter will, where appropriate, complement the Programme's support for the European Universities initiative, in particular its research dimension as part of developing new joint and integrated long term and sustainable strategies on education, research and innovation. In the field of digital skills, the Digital Europe Programme will complement the wide approach of Erasmus+ to skills by supporting the development and acquisition of advanced digital skills needed for the deployment of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence or high-performance computing, in cooperation with relevant industries. In line with Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Programme will take into account the specific situation of the outermost regions of the Union and seek to increase their participation in all actions of the Programme, including those with third countries. The future Programme will aim at acting as a \"vehicle\" to support valuable learning mobility formats in other policy areas of the Union. A new action will be introduced, under key action 3, to support mobility of organisations or individuals that are targeted specifically in other policy areas (e.g. public governance sector, agriculture and rural development, enterprise, law enforcement). 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis Union action in the field of education, training, youth and sport is enshrined in Articles 165 and 166 TFEU which give the Union a supporting competence with the aim to contribute to the development of quality education, the implementation of a vocational training policy and of a youth policy and the promotion of European sporting issues. \u2022 Subsidiarity While Member States remain responsible for the content and organisation of their policies in the fields concerned, this Programme aims to boost transnational and international mobility and cooperation projects, and to support policy developments with a European dimension. The access to the Programme will be made easier for small actors. In general, it will support transnational activities but also, in exceptional cases, national activities with a strong European dimension, such as activities on a specific European theme or policy priority. This will allow organisations with lower organisational capacity and participants with little or no experience in transnational cooperation, such as grassroots organisations and newcomers, to 12 COM(2018) 267.

        "EN 7 EN have a first time experience in accessing Union funds and gaining knowledge in view of future transnational cooperation activities. The objectives of this initiative cannot be adequately and sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the transnational character, high volume and wide geographical scope of the learning mobility and cooperation activities funded, their effects on access to learning mobility and more generally on Union integration, as well as its reinforced international dimension. As demonstrated by the Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation, single initiatives of education institutions or Member States, though deemed efficient and beneficial at national level, have insufficient scale and volume, and do not reach a European-wide effect. In terms of scope, the cumulative individual country and cross sectoral coverage remains limited compared to the current Erasmus+ programme. \u2022 Proportionality This proposal will cover all education and training sectors - schools, vocational education and training, higher education and adult education - youth and sport in a focused and streamlined way. It will reinforce the tried-and-tested actions the impact of which has been evidenced by the Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation. To maximise its impact, the volume of learning mobility and cooperation activities will be increased in sectors showing the highest performance, to respond to the high unmet demand and address the challenges described under section 1. Existing actions will be streamlined and refocused (such as adult learning, sport and Jean Monnet) taking into account the results of the mid-term evaluation of the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ programme 13 and stakeholder consultations. The use of new and flexible formats will be promoted to broaden the reach of the Programme (such as virtual cooperation, short term and group mobility). A limited number of new actions will be introduced to address new challenges and political priorities (such as the European Universities and Jean Monnet in other fields of education and training). These measures are considered to be the most suitable for making the Programme more inclusive and more effective. The improvements proposed will be integrated in the existing programme architecture and use the existing delivery mechanisms to ensure maximum continuity and stability with the predecessor programme. Hence this initiative does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued. \u2022 Choice of the instrument The proposed instrument is a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation The above-mentioned mid-term evaluation of the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ programme, which assessed the progress in the implementation of the Programme in the period 2014-2016 and the long-term impact of its predecessor programmes, showed that the current Erasmus+ delivers a unique package of outcomes in the field of education, training, youth and sport and is highly valued by stakeholders and the public. It highlighted the strong European added value of Erasmus+ and its predecessor programmes. The evaluation also found that all the predecessor programmes evaluated were highly effective whereas Erasmus+ is more coherent, relevant and only, in part, more efficient than its predecessors. Moreover, it highlighted the positive effects of the integrated nature of the Programme covering learning in all its contexts 13 COM(2018) 50 final and SWD(2018) 40 final. ",
        "EN 8 EN and at all stages of life (lifelong learning logic). The implementation modes were also seen as overall clear and fit for purpose. The evaluation indicated some areas for improvement, in particular: \u2013 in terms of relevance, the evaluation pointed to the need to better reach out to individuals with fewer opportunities and to facilitate the participation of smaller organisations to make the programme more inclusive; to reinforce measures to foster the understanding of European integration and sense of belonging to Europe, in particular amongst the youngest generations; \u2013 in terms of effectiveness, the volume of activities in sectors showing the highest performance, but which have, until now, received relatively less funding, should be reinforced such as in the school, vocational education and training and youth sectors, which will also contribute to reinforcing the inclusion dimension of the Programme; \u2013 in terms of efficiency, the procedures of application and reporting could be further simplified to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries and the online procedures be further optimised. This proposal takes largely into account the findings and recommendations for improvements made by the external evaluator with a view to a successor programme. The key findings of the mid-term evaluation are further described in the Impact Assessment (see section 1.3.1) and a detailed account of the findings and recommendations of the evaluation can be found in the staff working document which accompanied the mid-term evaluation report 14 . \u2022 Stakeholder consultations Large-scale public and stakeholder consultations took place from November 2016 and throughout much of 2017 within the context of the Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation in all programme countries 15 . This was done through a mix of consultation activities: semi- structured interviews, online surveys among the beneficiaries of the programme, case studies and an open public consultation launched on 28 February 2017 for three months with a view to gather the opinions of the general public and of all interested groups. Data and views were collected from the implementing bodies of the Programme as well as from non-beneficiaries and bodies in charge of the implementation of other comparable programmes. Ad hoc stakeholder consultations were also undertaken on the Jean Monnet activities and on the Student Loan Guarantee Facility. All in all, over a million responses were received from all interested parties. The programme countries submitted national reports on the implementation and impact in their respective territories of the actions of Erasmus+ they had to manage. The data collected during these consultations showed unanimous support from Member States, learning institutions and participants for further strengthening of the programme while maintaining stability and continuity of the programme in terms of basic architecture and delivery mechanisms. Main areas of future improvement identified during consultations concerned the need to further simplify the programme rules and reduce the administrative burden, notably on decentralised international higher education actions and to make the programme more inclusive. It was also suggested to review the share out between the 14 SWD(2018) 40 final. 15 The Programme countries i.e. the twenty-eight Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Macedonia and Turkey.

Stakeholders also underlined that the future programme should remain integrated and underpinned by the lifelong learning concept and called for further simplifying procedures and processes \u2013 also through the optimisation of online tools as well as increasing budget flexibility. This is particularly an issue as regards the international actions of the programme in the field of higher education which are managed by the national agencies in a separate way for each global region in a too rigid manner. They also called for reinforcing the synergies with European Structural Investment Funds. A separate open public consultation 16 was carried out from 9 January 2018 to 9 March 2018 in the context of the preparation of the next generation of financial programmes for the period after 2020, inter alia to seek inputs on the design of the future programme. This consultation confirmed that the current Erasmus+ programme is perceived as one of the Union \u2019 s most successful and highly relevant programmes. The stakeholders strongly underlined the European added value of Erasmus+ as compared to similar national programmes. The programme's integrated architecture and management modes were considered appropriate and fit for purpose. In terms of main challenges of the future programme, this consultation confirmed the findings of earlier consultation activities (need to effectively reach out to most disadvantaged target groups and to facilitate the participation of grassroots organisations and newcomers; insufficient level of funding perceived as a barrier for the programme to reach its full potential, need for further simplification in the application and reporting processes). Stakeholders also highlighted the limited added value of the Student Loan Guarantee Facility. With regard to the objectives of the future programme, the stakeholders emphasised the need to refocus priorities towards more social inclusion and fairness, modernisation of education and training, as well as more emphasis on European identity, active citizenship and participation in the democratic life. Stakeholders' key messages referred to enhanced short- term mobility options, opportunities for pupil mobility and enhanced adult mobility, mutual recognition of diplomas, more virtual tools, more small scale projects, increased budget for the programme, build stronger links with neighbouring countries and widen the geographical scope for the cooperation with the rest of the world, increased flexibility, extended opportunities of cross-sectoral co-operation. Stakeholders also called for greater synergies with European Social Fund and improvement of the dissemination and effective exploitation of project results. The stakeholder consultations are detailed in the above-mentioned mid-term evaluation and in the Impact Assessment (see its Annex II). \u2022 External expertise The Commission relied on the expertise of an external contractor and other reviewed studies in the context of its above-mentioned mid-term evaluation of the programme. In its Report 17 , the contractor summarised the findings of its evaluation of the Erasmus+ programme in the period 2014 \u2013 2016 and the predecessor programmes in the period 2007 \u2013 2013. The analysis covered all sectors of the programme: education, training, youth and sport 16 The Consultation was led by the European Commission Secretariat General and covered a cluster of programmes in fields of education/ training, culture, citizenship and justice. The consultation received 1127 responses which were directly relevant to the Erasmus + programme.

The evaluation furthermore offered a focused evaluation on an action currently piloted under the programme, eTwinning Plus. The evaluation was structured around five evaluation criteria (relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and Union added value). In addition, the report was accompanied by several self-standing reports: an evaluation of the Student Loan Guarantee Facility and of Jean Monnet, a synopsis report of the results of the three-months open public consultation launched in February 2017 and a synthesis of the Reports by the National Authorities. In its report the contractor identified a number of areas for improvement and made related recommendations. As already mentioned above, the Commission based itself on these findings and recommendations in its report on the mid-term evaluation of the Erasmus+ programme. \u2022 Impact Assessment The Impact Assessment focused on two options: (1) continuing the programme in its current form with the current budget corrected to take account of the United Kingdom leaving the Union (EU-27) which represents the minimum critical mass investment in the field of education, training, youth and sport at Union level to continue to have a positive outcome. Some efficiency gains could be introduced by streamlining and refocusing some existing actions; (2) a strengthened, more inclusive and extended programme with a number of improvements that would allow the programme to better address the challenges identified in the context of the mid-term evaluation and subsequent consultations, also taking into account the latest policy developments. The preferred option identified in the Impact Assessment is a strengthened programme, in line with the abovementioned Communication of 2 May 2018 on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027. The Impact Assessment developed a number of sub-options, focusing on the improvements and novelties compared to the current programme, while keeping the current integrated programme architecture and delivery mechanisms. It provided an indicative priority ranking of a number of improvements and novelties that could be implemented in case of a moderate budgetary increase for the programme under the next multiannual financial framework, while others could be implemented only on the condition of a higher increase of the overall budget. The scope and volume of the funded actions could: \u2013 remain stable with a similar envelope, with improvements in terms of efficiency and simplification, by streamlining and refocusing certain actions, allowing the programme to work as effectively as it has done during the 2014-2020 programming period; or \u2013 should the programme's envelope be increased, the scope and volume of the various existing actions could be increased and the identified new activities (including the cost intensive ones) could be implemented to their full extent, broadening the scope and increasing the European added value of the Programme. This second proposal was considered to be the best policy choice for the following reasons: ",
        "EN 11 EN \u2013 In terms of the programme\u2019s objectives, the preferred policy option responds best to the need of having an instrument that delivers efficiently on the Union's post 2020 objectives, in particular on the need to step up mobility and exchanges in all categories of learners, and the need to step up efforts to reach out to learners with fewer opportunities and to increase opportunities to cooperate including for smaller organisations, thus bringing Europeans together and strengthening European identity and commitment to European common values in times of rising populism; \u2013 In terms of priorities, the preferred policy option has been designed to better align the actions with the priorities set at Union level and takes account of the feedback received from stakeholders and the general public in the context of the midterm evaluation and the Erasmus 30-year campaign. It entails a rationalisation and refocusing of certain existing actions. For example, some actions will be specifically targeted towards activities that foster the development of competences in forward- looking fields; others will be aimed at fostering innovation in education, training, youth and sport; Jean Monnet activities will be partially refocused to target for example pupils in schools, the actions in the adult learning sector will be targeted to a more specifically defined target group (the lower skilled). At the same time, the proposal reinforces the inclusive dimension of the programme by adapting certain existing actions and introducing new measures (such as short term and group mobility and virtual cooperation). In addition, the preferred policy option establishes a certain level of flexibility in order to take into account of emerging priorities and needs emerging in the course of the programming period. \u2013 In terms of delivery mechanism, the preferred policy option, which aims at maintaining the existing \u2013 and unique \u2013 combination of management modes of the current Erasmus+ programme, based on the positive experience of the implementation of the programme, as evaluated at mid-term, will allow focusing on delivery and performance while minimising administrative burden. The national agencies established in each of the programme countries participating in the current Erasmus+ (indirect management) will continue to be in charge of managing the main part of the funds, i.e. most of those allocated to mobility and cooperation actions. National agencies are equipped to manage a large volume of actions of relatively low amounts that require proximity to the beneficiaries, adapt to the diversity of national education, training and youth systems, and align with national priorities. Direct management would be maintained for a number of specific actions that 1) do not have a critical mass of budget to be decentralised, 2) require a European or world- wide intervention, 3) are still embryonic at conceptual level and need a \"pilot\" phase before being decentralised, or 4) require competition based on excellence. In addition, the preferred policy option will allow a certain level of flexibility in order to take into account emerging priorities and needs in the course of the multi-annual programming period. This proposal is fully consistent with the preferred policy option. On 13 April 2018 the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion with reservations 18 on the understanding that the draft impact assessment report should be adjusted in order to integrate the Board recommendations on some key aspects. As a result, the report was revised with a view to: 18 SEC(2018) 265. This opinion concerns a draft impact assessment report which differs from the one adopted. ",

The opinion and the adjustments brought to the Impact Assessment report are further detailed in its first Annex. \u2022 Simplification In line with one of the cross-cutting objectives of the multiannual financial framework for the period after 2020, this proposal aims to reduce the burden for beneficiaries and implementing bodies. Rules and procedures such as grants selections, reporting, monitoring and control are as far as possible aligned on the rules and procedures common to all funding instruments, and the common horizontal rules of the Financial Regulation 19 are used as much as possible. Simplification and rationalisation of common indicators and criteria for selection will also help reducing the burden directly on beneficiaries and national agencies. Moreover, the administrative burden for beneficiaries will be decreased by making full use of improved online tools. Improvements and novelties will be integrated in the existing programme architecture and will use the existing delivery mechanisms. To ensure, as far as possible, continuity with the programming period 2014-2020, a light and proportionate procedure will be established for the re-designation of national agencies that have been in charge of implementing the programme at national level and the independent audit bodies that have been responsible for auditing in the current programme period. The benefits of such a light procedure for the designation of the implementing structures will free up resources at national level in the preparations of the next generation Programme. This proposal also aims to further simplify and streamline the architecture of the Programme. In line with the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation, it will rationalise the structure of some of the actions to better target them and avoid overlaps, for example by differentiating partnerships focusing on innovation and partnerships whose purpose is mutual learning, cooperation and exchanges of best practices. Furthermore, it will bring most of the mobility actions under the same key action, shifting the mobility of school pupils from key action 2 (cooperation among organisations) to key action 1 (learning mobility for individuals). The actions of the Programme will now be organised according to the logic of 'key actions', including in the field of sport, thereby facilitating cross-sectoral dynamics. Access to the next Programme for smaller organisations, such as grassroots organisations, newcomers and people who are hard to reach will be made easier. Potential candidates may be discouraged by the application procedures as well as by the administrative burden that follows from managing Union projects. Even though applicants appreciate the use of simplified cost options and grants (lump sums, unit costs and flat rates), the bureaucracy is a major problem 19 [Reference]. ",
        "EN 13 EN for some of them, in particular smaller-sized organisations, for example in the school, adult education and youth sectors. This proposal will implement an action (small-scale partnerships) that is specifically designed for such small-scale actors, with a lower level of administrative criteria and requirements compared to other traditional cooperation projects, with a view to reducing the entry barriers to the programme for organisations with a lower organisational capacity and newcomers. This action will also support flexible formats (generally transnational and, in exceptional cases, national activities with a strong European dimension) allowing organisations to reach out to people with fewer opportunities. Integrating other specific Union mobility schemes with a strong learning dimension from other policy areas into the Programme will contribute to enhanced implementation coherence, as well as further simplification and efficiency gains. It will also make the access of beneficiaries and stakeholders to learning mobility easier by getting closer to the idea of providing a one-stop shop for Union mobility schemes through the Erasmus Programme. Moreover, as evidenced by the mid-term evaluation, there is a need to significantly simplify the way the international actions of the programme are implemented. Currently, some parts of these actions are funded from four different Union external cooperation instruments 20 and from the European Development Fund. These actions will be simplified by reducing the number of external cooperation instruments and by rationalising the procedures for programming the implementation of Erasmus actions under these instruments. \u2022 Fundamental rights This proposal is fully consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the Union. In particular, this proposal takes full account of Article 14 (right to education), 15 (freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work), 21 (non-discrimination), 23 (equality between women and men), 24 (rights of the child), 26 (integration of persons with disabilities), 31 (fair and just working conditions) and 32 (prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work) of the Charter. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS In line with the Commission proposal for the multi-annual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, the financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme for the same period will be set at 30 000 000 000 EUR. Further details on the budgetary implications and the human and administrative resources required are provided in the Legislative and Financial Statement attached to this proposal. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The performance of the Programme will be monitored on a continuous basis, for the purposes of management, reporting and accountability, communication, visibility and exploitation of results.

These monitoring activities will aim to assess the progress towards achieving the output and results targets of the Programme, and to 20 Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA); European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI); Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI); Partnership Instrument for cooperation with third countries (PI).

In addition, the more complex and ambitious and long-term impact indicators will be measured a limited number of times over the programming cycle, either in the context of the formal mid-term and ex-post evaluation exercises of the future programme, or through dedicated independent studies and surveys to be undertaken by external experts. Some surveys could be used to measure the causal impact of certain actions of the Programme. Moreover, the monitoring and evaluation arrangements, taking into account the results of the mid-term evaluation report of the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ programme, will avoid putting any unnecessary burden on the beneficiaries of the Programme and the implementation bodies in terms of number and frequency of surveys, samples of respondents, amount and level of complexity of data collected, etc. Member States will contribute to the monitoring and evaluation process through their national reports on the implementation of the programme in their territory. Evaluations will be carried out in line with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 21 , where the three institutions agreed that evaluations of existing legislation and policy should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action. The evaluations will assess the programme's effects on the ground based on the programme indicators/targets and a detailed analysis of the degree to which the programme can be deemed relevant, effective, efficient, provides enough EU added value and is coherent with other EU policies. They will include lessons learnt to identify any lacks/problems or any potential to further improve the actions or their results and to help maximise their exploitation/impact. \u2022 Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal Chapter I \u2013 General provisions of the proposed Regulation sets out its subject-matter, the definitions of certain terms for the purposes of this Regulation, as well as the general and specific objectives of the Programme. The Programme aims to support the educational, professional and personal development of people in education, training, youth and sport, in Europe and beyond, thereby contributing to sustainable growth, jobs and social cohesion and to strengthening European identity. It is a key instrument to support the implementation of the Union's policies in the field of education, training, youth and sport. Specific objectives are defined for each of the three policy areas of the Programme (education and training, youth and sport). Each of the three policy areas are structured around three key actions, 'learning mobility' (key action 1), 'cooperation among organisations and institutions' (key action 2) and 'support to policy development and cooperation' (key action 3). Chapters II \u2013 IV identify the actions which shall be supported by the Programme in each policy area and under each key action, respectively in the fields of education and training (Chapter II), youth (Chapter III) and sport (Chapter IV). Chapter V \u2013 Financial provisions sets out the budgetary envelope of the Programme for the 2021-2027 period and the envisaged forms of Union funding. The prime reference amount is EUR 30 000 000 000. It also provides that an additional financial contribution shall be 21 Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016 (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.).

Some minimal amounts or thresholds are set for certain actions to allow the legislator to steer the implementation of the different dimensions of the Programme. Chapter VI \u2013 Participation in the programme specifies which third countries can be associated to the Programme and the conditions under which they can fully take part in it, together with the Member States. These third countries must fulfill all the conditions imposed by this Regulation on the Member States, such as the obligation to set up a national agency. Organisations and individuals from other third countries may nevertheless participate in some of the actions supported by the Programme. This Chapter also specifies some specific rules applicable to direct and indirect management in view of the Financial Regulation, in particular which entities may apply for funding and on the participation of experts in the evaluation committee referred to in Article [150(3)] of the Financial Regulation. Chapter VII \u2013 Programming, monitoring and evaluation sets out the necessary provisions for the conferral of powers to the Commission to adopt work programmes and delegated powers to review and/or complement the performance indicators. It also specifies the requirements in terms of monitoring, reporting and evaluation of the performance of the Programme. Chapter VIII \u2013 Information, communication and dissemination defines the requirements for all the actors concerned in terms of dissemination of information, publicity and follow-up with regard to all actions supported by the Programme. Chapter IX \u2013 Management and audit system establishes the provision for the establishment and functioning of the implementing bodies of the Programme. In management terms, the proposed delivery mechanism is a combination of indirect management and direct management. The combination of management modes builds on the existing structures of the current programme. National agencies will be in charge of managing the large majority of the funds of the Programme. Chapter X \u2013 Control system lays down the necessary supervisory system to ensure that the protection of the financial interests of the Union is duly taken into account when actions financed under this Regulation are implemented. Chapter XI \u2013 Complementarity with other Union policies, programmes and funds provides that the Programme shall be implemented so as to ensure the overall consistency and complementarity of the Programme with other Union policies and instruments and the principle for topping up of funds. Specific rules are foreseen to allow for complementarities between the Programme and the European Structural and Investment funds. Chapter XII \u2013 Transitional and final provisions sets out the necessary provisions for the conferral of delegated powers to the Commission and to ensure the transition between programmes. As regards the Committee required under Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 to assist the Commission in adopting implementing acts, would be the Committee established by Article 36 of Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 establishing the Erasmus+ programme.

(2) In its Communication on Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture of 14 November 2017, the Commission put forward its vision to work towards a European Education Area by 2025, in which learning would not be hampered by borders; a Union, where spending time in another Member State for purposes of studying and learning in any form or setting would become the standard and where, in addition to one's mother tongue, speaking two other languages would become the norm; a Union in which people would have a strong sense of their identity as Europeans, of Europe's cultural heritage and its diversity. In this context, the Commission emphasised the need to boost the tried-and-tested Erasmus+ programme in all categories of learners that it already covers and reaching out to learners with fewer opportunities. (3) The importance of education, training and youth for the future of the Union is reflected in the Commission's Communication of 14 February 2018 entitled 'A new, modern Multiannual Financial Framework for a European Union that delivers efficiently on its priorities post-2020' 24 , which stresses the need to deliver on the 22 OJ C , , p. . 23 OJ C , , p. . 24 COM(2018) 98 final.

The Communication stresses the need to step up mobility and exchanges, including through a substantially strengthened, inclusive and extended programme, as had been called for by the European Council in its conclusions of 14 December 2017. (4) The European Pillar of Social Rights, solemnly proclaimed and signed on 17 November 2017 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, lays down, as its first key principle, that everyone has the right to quality and inclusive education, training and lifelong learning in order to maintain and acquire skills that enable them to participate fully in society and manage successfully transitions in the labour market. (5) On 16 September 2016 in Bratislava, leaders of twenty-seven Member States stressed their determination to provide better opportunities for youth. In the Rome Declaration signed on 25 March 2017, leaders of twenty-seven Member States and of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission pledged to work towards a Union where young people receive the best education and training and can study and find jobs across the Union; a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and promotes cultural diversity. (6) The mid-term evaluation report of the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ programme confirmed that the creation of a single programme on education, training, youth and sport resulted in significant simplification, rationalisation and synergies in the management of the Programme while further improvements are necessary to further consolidate the efficiency gains of the 2014-2020 Programme. In the consultations for the mid-term evaluation and on the future Programme, Member States and stakeholders made a strong call for continuity in the Programme's scope, architecture and delivery mechanisms, while calling for a number of improvements, such as making the Programme more inclusive. They also expressed their full support for keeping the Programme integrated and underpinned by the lifelong learning paradigm. The European Parliament, in its Resolution of 2 February 2017 on the implementation of Erasmus+, welcomed the integrated structure of the programme and called on the Commission to exploit fully the lifelong learning dimension of the programme by fostering and encouraging cross-sectoral cooperation in the future programme. Member States and stakeholders also highlighted the need to keep a strong international dimension in the Programme and to extend it to other sectors of education and training. (7) The open public consultation on Union funding in the areas of values and mobility confirmed these key findings and emphasised the need to make the future programme a more inclusive programme and to continue to focus priorities on modernising education and training systems as well as strengthening priorities on fostering European identity, active citizenship and participation in democratic life. (8) In its Communication on 'A modern budget for a Union that protects, empowers and defends - the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027' 26 adopted on 2 May 2018, the Commission called for a stronger \u201cyouth\u201d focus in the next financial framework, notably by more than doubling the size of the 2014-2020 Erasmus+ Programme, one of the Uni on\u2019s most visible success stories.

(9) In this context, it is necessary to establish the successor programme for education, training, youth and sport (the 'Programme') of the 2014-2020 Erasmus + programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council 27 . The integrated nature of the 2014-2020 programme covering learning in all contexts - formal, non-formal and informal, and at all stages of life - should be maintained to boost flexible learning paths allowing individuals to develop those competences that are necessary to face the challenges of the twenty-first century. (10) The Programme should be equipped to become an even greater contributor to the implementation of the Union's policy objectives and priorities in the field of education, training, youth and sport. A coherent lifelong learning approach is central to managing the different transitions that people will face over the course of their life cycle. In taking this approach forward, the next Programme should maintain a close relationship with the overall strategic framework for Union policy cooperation in the field of education, training and youth, including the policy agendas for schools, higher education, vocational education and training and adult learning, while reinforcing and developing new synergies with other related Union programmes and policy areas. (11) The Programme is a key component of building a European Education Area. It should be equipped to contribute to the successor of the strategic framework for cooperation in education and training and the Skills Agenda for Europe 28 with a shared commitment to the strategic importance of skills and competences for sustaining jobs, growth and competitiveness. It should support Member States in reaching the goals of the Paris Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education 29 . (12) The Programme should be coherent with the new European Union youth strategy 30 , the framework for European cooperation in the youth field for 2019-2027, based on the Commission's Communication of 22 May 2018 on 'Engaging, connecting and empowering young people: a new EU Youth Strategy' 31 . (13) The Programme should take into account the Union work plan for sport which is the cooperation framework at Union level in the field of sport for the years [\u2026] 32 . Coherence and complementarity should be ensured between the Union work plan and actions supported under the Programme in the field of sport. There is a need to focus in particular on grassroots sports, taking into account the important role that sports play in promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyle, social inclusion and equality. The Programme should contribute to promote European common values through sport, good governance and integrity in sport, as well as education, training and skills in and through sport. (14) The Programme should contribute to strengthening the Union's innovation capacity notably by supporting mobility and cooperation activities that foster the development 27 Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing 'Erasmus+': the Union programme for education, training, youth and sport and repealing Decisions No 1719/2006/EC, No 1720/2006/EC and No 1298/2008/EC (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 50). 28 COM(2016) 381 final. 29 [Reference]. 30 [Reference - to be adopted by the Council by the end of 2018 ]. 31 COM(2018) 269 final. 32 [Reference].

(15) Synergies with Horizon Europe should ensure that combined resources from the Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme 33 are used to support activities dedicated to strengthening and modernising European higher education institutions. Horizon Europe will, where appropriate, complement the Programme's support for the European Universities initiative, in particular its research dimension as part of developing new joint and integrated long term and sustainable strategies on education, research and innovation. Synergies with Horizon Europe will help to foster the integration of education and research in higher education institutions. (16) The Programme should be more inclusive by improving its outreach to those with fewer opportunities, including through more flexible learning mobility formats, and by fostering participation of small organisations, in particular newcomers and community-based grassroots organisations that work directly with disadvantaged learners of all ages. Virtual formats, such as virtual cooperation, blended and virtual mobility, should be promoted to reach more participants, in particular those with fewer opportunities and those for whom moving physically to a country other than their country of residence would be an obstacle. (17) In its Communication on Strengthening European identity through education and culture, the Commission highlighted the pivotal role of education, culture and sport in promoting active citizenship and common values amongst the youngest generations. Strengthening European identity and fostering the active participation of individuals in the democratic processes is crucial for the future of Europe and our democratic societies. Going abroad to study, learn, train and work or to participate in youth and sport activities contributes to strengthening this European identity in all its diversity and the sense of being part of a cultural community as well as to fostering such active citizenship, among people of all ages. Those taking part in mobility activities should get involved in their local communities as well as engage in their host country local communities to share their experience. Activities linked to reinforcing all aspects of creativity in education, training and youth and enhancing individual key competencies should be supported. (18) The international dimension of the Programme should be boosted aiming at offering a greater number of opportunities for mobility, cooperation and policy dialogue with third countries not associated to the Programme. Building on the successful implementation of international higher education and youth activities under the predecessor programmes in the fields of education, training and youth, the international mobility activities should be extended to other sectors, such as in vocational education and training. (19) The basic architecture of the 2014-2020 programme in three chapters - education and training, youth and sport \u2013 structured around three key actions has proved successful and should be maintained. Improvements to streamline and rationalise the actions supported by the Programme should be introduced. (20) The Programme should reinforce existing learning mobility opportunities, notably in those sectors where the Programme could have the biggest efficiency gains, to broaden its reach and meet the high unmet demand. This should be done notably by increasing 33 COM(2018) [ ]. ",
        "EN 20 EN and facilitating mobility activities for higher education students, school pupils and learners in vocational education and training. Mobility of low-skilled adult learners should be embedded in partnerships for cooperation. Mobility opportunities for youth participating in non-formal learning activities should also be extended to reach more young people. Mobility of staff in education, training, youth and sport should also be reinforced, considering its leverage effect. In line with the vision of a true European Education Area, the Programme should also boost mobility and exchanges and promote student participation in educational and cultural activities by supporting digitalisation of processes, such as the European Student Card. This initiative can be an important step in making mobility for all a reality first by enabling higher education institutions to send and receive more exchange students while still enhancing quality in student mobility and also by facilitating students' access to various services (library, transport, accommodation) before arriving at the institution abroad. (21) The Programme should encourage youth participation in Europe's democratic life, including by supporting participation projects for young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European common values including fundamental rights, bringing together young people and decision makers at local, national and Union level, as well as contributing to the European integration process. (22) The Programme should offer young people more opportunities to discover Europe through learning experiences abroad. Eighteen year olds, in particular those with fewer opportunities, should be given the chance to have a first-time, short-term individual or group experience travelling throughout Europe in the frame of an informal educational activity aimed at fostering their sense of belonging to the European Union and discovering its cultural diversity. The Programme should identify bodies in charge of reaching out and selecting the participants and support activities to foster the learning dimension of the experience. (23) The Programme should also enhance the learning of languages, in particular through widened use of online tools, as e-learning offers additional advantages for language learning in terms of access and flexibility. (24) The Programme should support measures that enhance the cooperation between institutions and organisations active in education, training, youth and sport, recognising their fundamental role in equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a changing world as well as to adequately fulfil the potential for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, in particular within the digital economy. (25) In its Conclusions of the 14 of December 2017, the European Council called on Member States, the Council and the Commission to take forward a number of initiatives to elevate European cooperation in education and training to a new level, including by encouraging the emergence by 2024 of 'European Universities', consisting in bottom-up networks of universities across the Union. The Programme should support these European Universities. (26) The 2010 Bruges Communiqu\u00e9 called for support of vocational excellence for smart and sustainable growth. The 2017 Communication on Strengthening Innovation in Europe's Regions points to linking vocational education and training to innovation systems, as part of smart specialisation strategies at regional level. The Programme should provide the means to respond to these calls and support the development of transnational platforms of Centres of vocational excellence closely integrated in local ",

These centres of excellence should act as drivers of quality vocational skills in a context of sectorial challenges, while supporting overall structural changes and socio-economic policies in the Union. (27) To increase the use of virtual cooperation activities, the Programme should support a more systematic use of the online platforms such as eTwinning, the School Education Gateway, the Electronic Platform for Adult Learning in Europe, the European Youth Portal and the online platform for higher education. (28) The Programme should contribute to facilitating transparency and recognition of skills and qualifications, as well as the transfer of credits or units of learning outcomes, to foster quality assurance and to support validation of non-formal and informal learning, skills management and guidance. In this regard, the Programme should also provide support to contact points and networks at national and Union level that facilitate cross- European exchanges as well as the development of flexible learning pathways between different fields of education, training and youth and across formal and non-formal settings. (29) The Programme should mobilise the potential of former Erasmus+ participants and support activities in particular of Alumni networks, ambassadors and Europeers, by encouraging them to act as multipliers of the Programme. (30) As a way to ensure cooperation with other Union instruments and support to other policies of the Union, mobility opportunities should be offered to people in various sectors of activity, such as the public sector, agriculture and enterprise, to have a learning experience abroad allowing them, at any stage of their life, to grow and develop professionally but also personally, in particular by developing an awareness of their European identity and an understanding of European cultural diversity. The Programme should offer an entry point for Union transnational mobility schemes with a strong learning dimension, simplifying the offer of such schemes for beneficiaries and those taking part in these activities. The scaling-up of Erasmus projects should be facilitated; specific measures should be put in place to help promoters of Erasmus projects to apply for grants or develop synergies through the support of the European Structural and Investment Funds and the programmes relating to migration, security, justice and citizenship, health and culture. (31) It is important to stimulate teaching, learning and research in European integration matters, as well as to promote debates on these matters through the support of Jean Monnet actions in the fields of higher education but also in other fields of education and training. Fostering a sense of European identity and commitment is particularly important at times when the common values on which the Union is founded, and which form part of our European identity, are put to the test, and when citizens show low levels of engagement. The Programme should continue to contribute to the development of excellence in European integration studies. (32) Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, this Programme will contribute to mainstream climate action in the Union's policies and to the achievement of an overall target of 25% of the Union budget expenditures supporting climate objectives. Relevant actions will be identified during the Programme's preparation and implementation and reassessed in the context of the relevant evaluations and review process. ",

In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute Union fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 44 . In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union\u2019s financial interests and grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the European Public Prosecutor's Office and the European Court of Auditors, and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights. (51) It is necessary to ensure the complementarity of the actions carried out within the Programme with activities undertaken by the Member States and with other Union activities, in particular those in the fields of education, culture and the media, youth and solidarity, employment and social inclusion, research and innovation, industry and enterprise, agriculture and rural development with a focus on young farmers, cohesion, regional policy and international cooperation and development. (52) While the regulatory framework already allowed Member States and regions to establish synergies in the previous programming period between Erasmus+ and other Union instruments, such as the European structural and investment funds, which also support the qualitative development of education, training and youth systems in the Union, this potential has so far been underexploited, thus limiting the systemic effects of projects and impact on policy. Effective communication and cooperation should take place at national level between the national bodies in charge of managing these various instruments to maximise their respective impact. The programme should allow for active cooperation with these instruments. (53) In order to review or complement the performance indicators of the Programme, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the Annex. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations are conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

These rules are laid down in the Financial Regulation and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, procurement, prizes and indirect implementation, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also concern the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States, as the respect for the rule of law is an essential precondition for sound financial management and effective Union funding.

Title of the proposal/initiative Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing 'Erasmus': the Union programme for education, training, youth and sport and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 1.2. Policy area(s) concerned (Programme cluster) 7. Investing in People, Social Cohesion and Values 1.3. The proposal/initiative relates to: \uf0fe a new action \uf0a8 a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action 48 \uf0a8 the extension of an existing action \uf0a8 a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action 1.4. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.4.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative In the short and long term the Programme aims to support learning mobility opportunities that contribute to the personal, educational, civic and professional development of individuals. The Programme will also support cooperation between stakeholders at organisational and policy level with a view to foster inclusion, excellence, creativity and innovation in education, training, youth and sport. Subject to the entry into force of its basic act, the Programme is planned to be implemented as of 1 st January 2021, for a duration of seven years. 1.4.2. Added value of Union involvement While Member States remain responsible for the content and organisation of their policies in the fields concerned, the Programme aims to boost transnational and international mobility and cooperation projects, as well as to support policy developments with a European dimension. The objectives of this initiative cannot be adequately and sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the transnational character, high volume and wide geographical scope of the learning mobility and cooperation activities funded, their effects on access to learning mobility and more generally on Union integration, as well as reinforced international dimension. As demonstrated by the Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation, single initiatives of education institutions or Member States, though deemed efficient and beneficial at national level, have insufficient scale and volume, and do not reach a European-wide effect. Union actions allow to strengthen critical mass and to address pan-European challenges in the areas concerned. In terms of scope, the cumulative individual country and cross sectoral coverage remains limited compared to the current Erasmus+ programme. The Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation found that in absence of the programme, the learners and staff mobility, as well as European cooperation in the sectors covered by the programme, 48 As referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation. ",
        "EN 49 EN would be substantially reduced. The main Union added value of the cooperation activities as outlined by the evaluation concerns gains of quality, innovation, professionalisation and internationalisation for the involved organisations, as well as increased levels of cross-sectoral cooperation, improved geographical balance, with small countries and countries from central and Eastern Europe being better integrated. The evaluation also showed that the programme is actively building positive attitudes towards the European Union 49 and is contributing to the development of European identity, transversally across all activities funded. The evaluation also outlined the benefits of expanding activities specifically focused at improving knowledge and understanding of the European Union, in particular young people, school pupils and learners in vocational education and training. The Union added value also derives from the cumulative effect of the programme's activities to stimulate Europe's expertise, notably in certain key sectors of the future, strengthening the Union's competitiveness and innovation capacity. The transnational and international dimension of the supported activities nurture talents and develop connections in sectors that require a high degree of internationalisation. The programme will contribute to increase the volume of skilled professionals, whom have benefited from an international experience and have enriched their technical and transversal skills. The Union added value will be to shape the next generation of creative and innovative European citizens and help establish a true European mind-set. The transnational European dimension will develop connections in sectors that require a high degree of internationalisation. The support of innovation at Union level would also foster cross-fertilisation between countries, helping Members States to progress at a similar pace in the modernisation and innovation of their systems and policies. The programme will also contribute, both directly and indirectly, to harness opportunities and to tackle challenges currently faced by organisations, institutions, as well as by systems and policies that cater for citizens' personal, socio-educational and professional development by providing them with high quality, innovative and inclusive education, training, youth and sport activities. The programme will also include an action that is specifically designed to widen the access to the programme to smaller-sized actors and which will support flexible formats (generally transnational and, in exceptional cases, national activities with a strong European dimension, such as activities on a specific European theme or policy priority). This will allow organisations with lower organisational capacity and participants with little or no experience in transnational cooperation, such as grassroots organisations and newcomers, to have a first time experience in accessing Union funds and gaining knowledge in view of future transnational cooperation activities. 1.4.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past The recently completed Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation 50 assessed the progress in implementing Erasmus+ in the period 2014-2016 in all participating countries, as well as examined the long-term impact of the seven predecessor programmes for the period 2007- 2013 (ex-post evaluation), including in partner countries. The evaluation found that Erasmus+ and its predecessor programmes have demonstrated strong relevance, effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, the programme is highly valued by a broad variety of stakeholders as well as by the general public, benefiting from a strong brand name, recognised well beyond the group of direct beneficiaries and perceived as a Union flagship action. The mid-term evaluation also found evidence that the programme is contributing to a more cohesive Union and that it is effective in triggering innovation among organisations that participate in the 49 The positive association between participation in the programme and feeling of belonging to the Union is found across all sectors and all forms of participations. Learners benefiting directly from Erasmus+ were 19% more likely to feel European and 6% more likely to have positive feelings towards the Union \u2013 Source: Staff Working Document of Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation. 50 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/resources/documents.evaluations_en. ",
        "EN 50 EN programme. Erasmus+ has also proved important for the Union \u2019 s global outreach, notably by facilitating the cooperation between Europe and partner countries. Robust evidence has been produced about the effectiveness of the programme at various levels i.e. individual young people and staff benefiting from the programme, as well as organisations and systems. The programme has shown its capacity to expand and to adapt to new target groups as well as to continuously improve its delivery mechanisms. Erasmus+ has partially reduced the administrative burden for stakeholders and beneficiaries \u2013 e.g. enhancing digitalisation and introducing fast-track grant selection procedures. Reduced administrative burden enhanced the non-financial performance of the supported projects as beneficiaries were able to focus more on their projects' content. The evaluation also established that the restructuring of predecessor programmes into a single integrated programme has strengthened its coherence in terms of alignment between types of actions funded and the programme intervention logic, improved its efficiency, and simplified its architecture in three key actions. The stakeholders are calling for stability or progressive evolutions in the future. The evaluation recommended for the future programme: - to boost inclusiveness (both for individuals and organisations) for the vulnerable groups and to widen access to the programme, namely for individuals with fewer opportunities; - to optimise the actions aimed at stimulating innovation, contributing to bridge the skills and competences gap; - to better prioritise and to invest strategically in the sectors with the highest potential performance - schools, vocational education and training, youth; - to maximise relevance and impact of adult learning, Jean Monnet and Sport actions; - to boost European awareness: reinforce measures to foster understanding of European integration and sense of belonging to Europe; - to increase international opportunities and the programme's global outreach; - to further simplify programme rules and administrative procedures, including on international actions, optimised online tools, and reduced amount of information required from participants and beneficiaries; - to reinforce and develop new synergies with other Union instruments and policies; - to better involve policy-makers in the design and implementation of policy calls. 1.4.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments The Programme is one of the funding instruments under the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework aiming at investing in people, social cohesion and values. The Programme will be consistent with and complementary to other Union instruments, in particular the external cooperation instruments 51 , the European Structural and Investment Funds, the European Social Fund Plus and the European Regional Development Fund. The Programme will also seek synergies with the Asylum Migration Fund as well as with the Internal Security Fund. There are also important potential complementarities between the objectives and interventions of the Programme and the future Rights and Values programme. The Programme will be consistent with and constitute an important complement to the future Creative Europe programme. In the field of youth, the Programme will also be consistent with, and complement the European Solidarity Corps by offering different types of activities. In the field of digital skills, the Digital Europe Programme will complement the wide approach of Erasmus+ to skills by supporting the development and acquisition of advanced digital skills. Great potential for complementarities and synergies has been identified regarding common objectives (e.g. qualitative development of education, training and youth systems, human 51 The Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA III). ",
        "EN 51 EN capital development, etc.). These Union programmes are crucial for a more competitive, resilient, and future-proof Europe. Improved synergies and complementarities are expected to increase the coherence between the spending programmes and enable effective cooperation, responding to the current societal challenges. Although these programmes are supported by distinct instruments, with independent modi operandi, different intervention logics, management modes and architecture, their interaction can generate converging effects. Therefore, synergies will be looked for where they are possible and bring further added value. New or reinforced synergies could be established at several levels: 1. at strategic level, enhanced coherence and better alignment of shared policy objectives; 2. at programming level, enhanced coherence of priorities and compatible implementation frameworks; 3. at project level, strategic pooling of funding from several sources. As a concrete tool to enhance the implementation of synergies, it is proposed to integrate other mobility schemes with a strong learning dimension under Erasmus, thereby using the Erasmus programme infrastructure and delivery mechanisms as a \"vehicle\", and following the Erasmus intervention logic. A new action would be introduced with a view to supporting mobility of different categories of organisations or individuals that are targeted specifically in other policy areas (e.g. public governance sector, agriculture and rural development, enterprise, law enforcement, etc.). This will contribute to enhanced implementation coherence, as well as further simplification and efficiency gains. This Erasmus \"vehicle\" will be offered as a centralised action, for its limited critical mass (at least in its initial phase), as well as its cross-sectoral component. 1.5.

        "EN 53 EN 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules The future Erasmus monitoring and evaluation framework will follow an approach based on a) continuous monitoring to assess the progress towards achieving the output and results targets of the programme; and b) evaluations and studies/surveys to identify long-term impact of the programme, measured only few times over the programming cycle (formal mid-term and ex-post evaluation exercises, and dedicated independent studies and surveys). The objective is to use existing arrangements to the extent possible and to simplify, rationalise, and reduce the administrative burden for participants (individuals and organisations), while ensuring that sufficient information is collected to assess the impact of the programme and to safeguard accountability. Consequently, the rules for monitoring and reporting will be systematically established in view of their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, based on the experience gained in the current programme, without compromising the data needs for the purposes of evaluation. In line with the mid-term evaluation findings, the next Erasmus programme aims to simplify and to improve the monitoring system with regard to: - clarity and relevance of output indicators, as well as of the quality of the data; - robustness of the self-reported results indicators; - proportionality between the related burden on beneficiaries (number and frequency of surveys, samples of respondents, amount and level of complexity of data collected, etc.) and the use of the data for monitoring, evaluation and dissemination purposes; - user-friendliness and further inter-operability of online tools. 2.2. Management and control system(s) 2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed The proposed continued combination of programme management modes (direct and indirect) is based on the positive experience of the implementation of the current Erasmus+ programme, as evaluated at mid-term that found them fit for purpose \"with a good overall coordination and no major inefficiencies identified\". It builds on the existing structures, in compliance with the principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and efficiency. The preservation of tried and tested modalities will allow focusing on delivery and performance, safeguard proven efficiency gains, while minimising administrative burden (such as what was experienced during the transition from the 2007-2013 to the 2014-2020 programme generation). The general principle would be maintained: as a general rule, no direct support will be given to individual beneficiaries; support will continue to be channelled through participating organisations, which will distribute it to individual learners or practitioners. Overall the costs of management for the Union the current Erasmus+ programme are reasonable (6% of the Erasmus administrative and operational budget) 53 . This is particularly clear when compared to smaller national actions, which appear more costly (on average, 14% of their respective budget). 53 This includes the operating grant for National Agencies as well as the administrative expenditure of the direct management. ",
        "EN 54 EN 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them The risks identified in the implementation of the current programmes fall mainly into the following categories: - errors derived from the inexperience of beneficiaries with the rules. Error rates and financial adjustments are expected to be higher in the case of actions with more complex financial management rules, in particular when grants are based on real costs. This risk can be largely mitigated by using simplified costs (lump sums, flat rates and scales of unit costs) as permitted by the Financial Regulation; - reliability of the control chain and maintenance of the audit trail. Erasmus would be managed by a large number of intermediaries, the National Agencies, with supervisory controls provided by an Independent Audit Body as foreseen in the Financial Regulation, as well as operational and governance supervision by the National Authorities. The control framework that mitigates these risks is very well established; - specific target participants (e.g. youth or adult sectors) may not have the necessary financial solidity or sophisticated management structures and capacity for managing Union funds, and would be subject to additional monitoring and checks based on risk assessment. The main simplification to mitigate the risks and to reduce error rates resulting from the complexity of financial rules will be the wide use of grants in the form of lump sums, flat rates and scales of unit costs, and simplified formats of actions, making the rules easy to follow, while preserving accountability. All entrusted entities are always responsible for the primary level of controls in order to ensure the protection of the Union \u2019 s financial interest, while the Commission is responsible for supervising the overall framework. This solid control system currently in place will be maintained to control the use of Union funds for the actions managed under indirect management by National Agencies and as well as under direct management, in accordance with the Financial Regulation. With regard to the Programme funds transferred to the National Agencies, the Commission shall ensure proper coordination of its controls with the national authorities and the national agencies, on the basis of the single audit principle and following a risk-based analysis. While National Agencies will be in charge of primary controls of beneficiaries, their system of internal control and compliance will continue to be monitored and supervised by the Member States/National Authorities and audited by an Independent Audit Body 54 . To ensure coherence and reliability of controls at country level, the Commission will continue to issue yearly control guidance. The control system will be set up in a manner so as to ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the controls. The Commission's supervision and performance frameworks will ensure a high level of monitoring and feedback to inform the policy approach. Erasmus will be included in the Commission's programme of Supervisory visits, financial audits, and monitoring and implementation visits, as well as guidance activities such as conferences, kick-off meetings, meetings of National Agencies, training courses and webinars. 54 The independent audit body will issue an audit opinion on the yearly management declaration as referred to in Article [60(5)] of the Financial Regulation.

Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of \"control costs \u00f7 value of the related funds managed\"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) Regarding cost effectiveness, the Commission has made an initial estimation of the costs of the resources and inputs required for carrying out the controls and has estimated, in so far as possible, their benefits in terms of the amount of errors and irregularities prevented, detected and corrected by these controls but also in terms of non-quantifiable errors. This approach emphasises the core financial and operational checks of the control chain. The control strategy is based on a single integrated control framework in order to provide reasonable assurance throughout the project cycle. The approach taken to assess cost- effectiveness of controls is based on the logic of building blocks of assurance and a single integrated control framework. The Commission differentiates the frequency and the intensity of the controls \u2013 in view of the different risk profiles among its current and future transactions and of the cost-effectiveness of its existing and alternative controls, in particular as outlined to National Agencies in the programme implementation guidance. Executive Agencies and all entrusted entities are always responsible for the primary level of controls in order to ensure the protection of the Union \u2019 s financial interest, while the Commission is responsible for supervisory controls. The Commissions estimate is that the global cost of control is low, and in the range 1-5%, depending on the measure used, of the budget managed (Executive Agency's budget excluded). These costs are proportional and cost effective given the likely risk of error if such controls were not in place, and the requirement to ensure an error rate below 2%. Based on the experience with the current Erasmus+ and its predecessor programmes, which have an error rate of around 1% on a multiannual basis, the expected risk of error is less than 2%. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities The controls aimed at preventing and detecting fraud are not unlike those intended to ensure the legality and regularity of the transactions (the unintentional errors). Each year the Commission reviews all reporting from National Agencies on possible fraud or irregularities. These cases are mainly followed up at national level where the National Agencies have direct access to means of legal redress and referral of fraud cases. The Commission services contribute to ongoing European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) investigations and organise the follow-up to completed European Anti-fraud Office investigations. Financial prejudice to the Union's budget resulting from fraud established in final European Anti-fraud Office case reports concerning programmes with similar funding rules and stakeholders is low. Cases are referred to European Anti-fraud Office and to the Investigation and disciplinary Office (IDOC) as appropriate, but a significant number of cases are followed up during the year directly with National Agencies and National Authorities, who have direct access to the relevant judicial and anti-fraud entities. Commission services implementing the action have developed and implemented their own anti-fraud strategy (AFS) since 2014, elaborated on the basis of the methodology provided by the European Anti-fraud Office. Regularly updated, it is supplemented with (most recently 2017), where appropriate, lower-level procedural documents, covering how cases are referred and followed up. As concluded in the mid-term evaluation, given the fact that the scale of fraud within the programme is extremely limited and is largely restricted to cases of multiple project application submissions or project leaders failing to honour their obligations, the measures in place are considered both appropriate and proportionate. Considering the level of fraud ",
        "EN 56 EN impact potentially faced by the proposed programme, in particular the financial prejudice recorded by the European Anti-fraud Office, the residual risk of fraud does not justify additional measures. Commission services maintain close cooperation with the European Anti-fraud Office and follow the ongoing cases closely. Therefore it is possible to conclude positively on assurance in respect of fraud risk. ",

        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons and objectives The European Union is built on solidarity, a shared value which is strongly felt throughout European society. Solidarity is fundamental to the European project, providing a clear compass to guide Europe \u2019 s young people in their aspirations for a better EU. In the Rome Declaration, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the signature of the Treaty of Rome, the leaders of 27 Member States and of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission reaffirmed their commitment to enhance unity and solidarity in order to increase the strength and resilience of the EU 1 . The European Commission President \u2019 s State of the Union address of 14 September 2016 emphasised the need to invest in young people and announced the idea of a European Solidarity Corps. The aim of the Corps would be to create opportunities for young people across the EU to make a meaningful contribution to society, show solidarity and develop their skills, \u2018 thus getting not only work but also invaluable human experience \u2019 . The Bratislava Summit of 16 September 2016 called for greater political momentum to support young Europeans and establish new EU programmes to improve their opportunities. The European Commission \u2019 s Communication \u2018 A European Solidarity Corps \u2019 of 7 December 2016 2 launched the first phase of the Corps and reiterated the target of having 100 000 young Europeans taking part in it by 2020. During this initial phase, eight different EU programmes 3 were mobilised to offer volunteering, traineeship or job opportunities to young people across the EU. As there is potential to further develop solidarity with victims of crises and disasters in non-EU countries, this proposal provides for extending the scope of the European Solidarity Corps to include support to humanitarian aid operations in non-EU countries, including those located in the EU outermost regions' neighbourhood. As the ex ante evaluation accompanying this proposal shows, this extension would serve multiple purposes, such as creating a one-stop-shop for solidarity activities. This will include volunteering by humanitarian aid volunteers, an activity currently supported by the EU Aid Volunteers initiative. This initiative contributes to efforts to strengthen the EU \u2019 s capacity to provide needs-based humanitarian assistance and the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster- affected communities in non-EU countries. This proposal provides the legal framework for the European Solidarity Corps to increase the opportunities for young people to engage in solidarity activities by extending the scope of its activities as well as its geographical scope in this area. This will contribute to addressing not only unmet societal needs in Europe but also humanitarian challenges in non-EU countries. It will also promote the personal, educational, social, civic and professional development of young people. There are many young people who want to engage in solidarity activities, and there are many unmet needs in communities that could be addressed by involving young people in such activities. Many organisations are looking for motivated young people to help their efforts; if supported, these organisations could offer even more to communities. There are, however, imbalances in supply and demand. There are also obstacles to the availability of resources, to ensuring quality and to various legal aspects. 1 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/03/25-rome-declaration/. 2 European Commission (2016), A European Solidarity Corps, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2016) 942 final of 7.12.2016. 3 The Erasmus+ programme, the Employment and Social Innovation programme (EaSI), the LIFE programme, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, the Health programme, the Europe for Citizens programme, the European Regional Development Fund (through Interreg) and the Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. ",
        "EN 2 EN In the absence of measures to bring organisations and young people together to promote solidarity, there is a risk that a major potential for solidarity activities goes untapped. This could result in an unnecessary welfare loss to organisations, young people and society as a whole. Furthermore, as the ex ante and previous evaluations of Erasmus+ and the EU Aid Volunteers show, there is room for improvement by simplifying processes and gains to be made from greater efficiencies derived from economies of scale and scope. Against this background, the European Solidarity Corps aims to strengthen the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high-quality solidarity activities. The Corps is a means to help strengthen cohesion, solidarity and democracy in Europe and abroad and to address societal and humanitarian challenges on the ground, with a particular focus on promoting social inclusion. To reach this general objective, the European Solidarity Corps will provide young people with easily accessible opportunities to engage in volunteering, traineeships or jobs in solidarity-related sectors, such as the social economy, and to devise and develop solidarity projects at their own initiative. The latter will also contribute to young people \u2019 s personal, social and professional development, as well as their employability, by improving their skills and competences. The Corps will also support networking activities for its participants and organisations. These aim to foster a European Solidarity Corps \u2018spirit\u2019 and a sense of belonging to a wider community committed to solidarity, as well as to encourage the exchange of useful practices and experience. The Corps also aims to ensure that: \uf0b7 the solidarity activities offered to young participants help to address concrete societal challenges and needs-based humanitarian aid operations, and help to strengthen communities; and \uf0b7 the learning outcomes resulting from young people\u2019s participation in such activities are properly validated. This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of 27 Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and Euratom based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions The European Solidarity Corps draws on the rich and long-standing tradition and experience of Member States in activities that serve the public interest, e.g. through volunteering. Some Member States operate national civic service programmes offering young people the possibility to engage, while others facilitate activities undertaken by civil society. At EU level, the European Voluntary Service has provided volunteering opportunities for young people for 20 years. Policies and programmes such as the Youth Guarantee and the \u2018 Your First EURES Job \u2019 initiative are helping young people get into traineeships and jobs. The EU Aid Volunteers initiative, launched in 2014, offers individuals the opportunity to get volunteering experience in a non- EU country. Such experience helps provide humanitarian aid where it is needed most. These initiatives provide a solid basis which the European Solidarity Corps is not only building on but will also expand to offer new opportunities, wider visibility and greater impact. The Corps will offer new opportunities in the field of humanitarian aid that will no longer be supported by the EU Aid Volunteers initiative (which will end in 2020), while simplifying access for both interested young people and organisations. The Corps will continue offering a single, easily accessible entry point through its portal, and will aim at the widest possible outreach to participating organisations and the young people involved. It will also develop and improve the training available before an activity, as well as relevant support and the validation of learning outcomes after an activity. ",
        "EN 3 EN To ensure efficient and effective implementation, the European Solidarity Corps will make maximum use of management arrangements already in place. This will allow it to focus on maximising delivery and performance while minimising administrative burdens. For this reason, implementation of the Corps will be entrusted to existing structures. \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies The actions of the European Solidarity Corps are consistent with and complementary to a variety of relevant EU policies and programmes. These include, in particular, those relating to: \uf0b7 education and training; \uf0b7 employment; \uf0b7 gender equality; \uf0b7 entrepreneurship (in particular social entrepreneurship); \uf0b7 citizenship and democratic participation; \uf0b7 environment and nature protection; \uf0b7 climate action; \uf0b7 disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery; \uf0b7 agriculture and rural development; \uf0b7 provision of food and non-food items; \uf0b7 health and well-being; \uf0b7 creativity and culture; \uf0b7 physical education and sport; \uf0b7 social assistance and welfare; \uf0b7 reception and integration of third country nationals; \uf0b7 territorial cooperation and cohesion; \uf0b7 cooperation across borders; and \uf0b7 humanitarian aid. In the first and second phase of the European Solidarity Corps a number of different EU programmes were mobilised to offer volunteering, traineeship or job opportunities to young people across the EU. This proposal would constitute the background of a third phase of the European Solidarity Corps where its own well-defined envelope will allow all activities to be developed under the same set of rules and conditions for solidarity activities independently of the policy field addressed by the action. Since the new extended scope includes activities in support of humanitarian aid operations, the European Solidarity Corps will benefit from additional contributions for the support of the new scope of activities. The implementation of these activities will be done in close coordination with the relevant services within the Commission. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives 4 . The contribution of this programme to the 4 Modern Budget for a Union that Protects, Empowers and Defends \u2014 The Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, COM(2018) 321 final. ",
        "EN 4 EN achievement of this overall target will be tracked through an EU climate marker system at an appropriate level of disaggregation, including the use of more precise methodologies where these are available. The Commission will continue to present the information annually in terms of commitment appropriations in the context of the annual draft budget. To support the full utilisation of the potential of the programme to contribute to climate objectives, the Commission will seek to identify relevant actions throughout the programme preparation, implementation, review and evaluation processes. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis This proposal is based on two strands: \u2018 participation of young people in solidarity activities addressing societal challenges \u2019 and \u2018 European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps \u2019 . Consequently, the proposal is based on Articles 165(4), 166(4) and 214(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 165(4) allows EU action aimed at \u2018 encouraging the development of youth exchanges ( \u2026 ) and encouraging participation of young people in democratic life in Europe \u2019 . EU action based on Article 166(4) represents an appropriate legal basis for an act such as this proposal that aims to \u2018 improve initial and continuing vocational training in order to facilitate vocational integration and reintegration into the labour market \u2019 and \u2018 facilitate access to vocational training and encourage mobility of instructors and trainees and particularly young people \u2019. Article 214(5) provides the legal basis for the establishment of \u2018 a framework for joint contributions from young Europeans to the humanitarian aid operations of the Union, a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps \u2019 . \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) Given the European scale of the proposed objectives \u2014 to mobilise young people for solidarity causes throughout the EU and young volunteers to contribute to humanitarian aid in non-EU countries \u2014 action at EU level is appropriate. Action through the European Solidarity Corps will not replace similar actions for young people by Member States but will serve to complement and support them, in full respect of the subsidiarity principle. There are traditions in all Member States of running programmes and instruments supporting activities that serve the public interest, in particular through volunteering, which are quite diverse. Some countries \u2019 practice foresees State intervention, whereas in others civil society takes the lead. There are also different concepts and connotations of solidarity activities and volunteering, and the types of activities are different in content and duration. Moreover, there are different perceptions of how social protection relates to volunteering, as well as various degrees of legal status, learning and recognition. All this leads to fragmentation at EU level, which means that young people across the EU have uneven access to the opportunities on offer. EU action through the European Solidarity Corps helps overcome this fragmentation, as shown by the ex ante evaluation that accompanies this proposal. At the same time, it builds on the lessons learnt from the variety of experiences across Member States. It also boosts volunteering in Member States where it is less prevalent today, as suggested by the stakeholders who were consulted during the preparation of the [European Solidarity Corps Regulation] 5 . The Corps helps improve the quality of various activities for young people both within the EU and abroad, as well as the validation of their learning outcomes. It does so by applying a number of quality safeguards such as a quality label for participating organisations and the principles outlined in the Quality Framework for Traineeships 6 . 5 [Pending reference to European Solidarity Corps 2018-2020]. 6 Council Recommendation of 15 March 2018 on a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships (OJ C 153, 2.5.2018, p. 1). ",
        "EN 5 EN Furthermore, by extending the scope to cover activities in support of humanitarian aid operations, the European Solidarity Corps will offer a single entry point to high-quality volunteering and occupational solidarity activities for young people across the EU and abroad. Currently these are only accessible via two distinct schemes. The Corps will therefore ensure that all interested young people across the EU have equal opportunities to a broader variety of activities, and that they have easier access to them. Bringing the volunteering opportunities that support humanitarian aid under the existing European Solidarity Corps brand will also help improve awareness of the opportunities available to young people and give them greater visibility. The European Solidarity Corps will offer both activities that can be undertaken in a country other than the country of residence of the participants (cross-border activities and volunteering in support of humanitarian aid) and activities that can be undertaken in their country of residence (in-country). On cross-border activities, action by individual Member States cannot replace EU action. This is due to the fragmentation in structures and programmes offering volunteering and traineeships, and to the diversity in the understanding and concepts of the sector offering solidarity activities. As far as in- country activities are concerned, the European Solidarity Corps helps address local or national challenges from a broader European perspective. In particular, EU action can help overcome fragmentation in the offer of activities and ensure inclusiveness for all young people, including those who face obstacles to engaging in international activities. It also provides a European context and helps in finding European solutions to specific challenges that are not confined to national borders. Last but not least, the use of existing structures that have proved their worth helps ensure that the European Solidarity Corps is implemented effectively and efficiently. It also ensures that synergies and complementarities with Member States \u2019 actions in favour of youth and humanitarian aid are maximised. Indeed, while national frameworks could achieve similar results, they would do so at double the cost, as the mid-term evaluation of the Erasmus+ programme (2014-2020) 7 found. \u2022 Proportionality The improvements proposed will be integrated in the existing programme architecture and use the existing delivery mechanisms to ensure maximum continuity and stability with the predecessor programmes. The proposal addresses the gaps identified in the offer available to young people of easily accessible opportunities to engage in solidarity activities. It does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. \u2022 Choice of the instrument The proposed instrument is a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. 3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation The EU Aid Volunteers initiative underwent a mid-term evaluation 8 of its implementation covering mid-2014 to mid-2017. The evaluation provided useful analyses of and insights into the implementation of the initiative, including shortcomings and areas for further improvement. In particular, its low intake of volunteers must be highlighted, as their original target may not be achieved. From the external evaluation report 9 several recommendations can be highlighted. For instance, the report recommended the use of single branding and communication activities, which would increase the visibility of activities in support of humanitarian aid operations. Another 7 Mid-term evaluation of the Erasmus+ programme (2014-2020) (SWD(2018)40), 31 January 2018. 8 Mid-term evaluation of the EU Aid Volunteers, 2017. 9 Please note that the Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council as well as the Staff Working Document on the interim evaluation of the EU Aid Volunteers initiative has not been adopted yet. This part of the ex ante evaluation may be replaced by the text in the Report / SWD as soon as it is adopted. ",
        "EN 6 EN recommendation mentioned the possibility of moving from a vacancy-based application (as used in the EU Aid Volunteers initiative) towards a roster type of recruitment (as used in the European Solidarity Corps). Finally, the evaluation also highlighted the importance of further simplifying procedures, which would be achieved by aligning the process to the existing processes in the European Solidarity Corps. In addition, since the European Solidarity Corps is heavily based on the previous European Voluntary Service, which was implemented under Erasmus+, the Erasmus+ mid-term evaluation 10 provides valuable insights. The main results highlight the effectiveness of Erasmus+ in developing skills and competences; its undisputable European added value; a high degree of coherence, in particular due to the pooling of programmes and the single brand name; and its efficiency and simplicity, underscoring the cost-effectiveness of mobility actions and the reduced management cost (less than half of similar national schemes). These results reinforce the idea that extending the scope of the Corps to include activities currently implemented by the EU Aid Volunteers initiative would translate into efficiency gains, a clearer brand and positioning, and a greater number of opportunities for young people. \u2022 Stakeholder consultations A recent public consultation on \u2018 EU funds in the area of values and mobility \u2019 11 provides some information and analysis which is relevant for both the EU Aid Volunteers initiative and the current European Solidarity Corps. The response to the consultation was quite high, with 1 839 individual respondents, of which 1 199 represented an organisation. While no detailed analysis has yet been provided on the results, some preliminary observations can be made. For instance, over 75 % of respondents believe that promoting solidarity, social inclusion and skills development through mobility is important. However, fewer than 40 % of respondents believe that these issues are either fully or well addressed. Nonetheless, respondents clearly see the added value of EU action in this sector: over 75 % believe that the current programmes add value compared to what Member States could achieve nationally, regionally and/or locally. Of the respondents, 135 responded regarding the EU Aid Volunteers and/or the European Solidarity Corps. Of these, 82 % believe that the lack of budget to satisfy demand is one of the main obstacles preventing the current programmes from achieving their objectives at least to some extent. Also, linked to the simplification sought by integrating them, it must be highlighted that over 68 % of respondents believe that simplifying forms and grant selection processes would help to improve the results of the programmes. \u2022 Impact assessment An impact assessment has not been carried out as the content of this proposal is consistent with the existing European Solidarity Corps. Given that the proposal will involve significant spending, however, it is accompanied by an ex ante evaluation to fulfil the requirements in the Financial Regulation 12 . The evaluation examined challenges that may appear because of the expansion of the scope of activities and the geographical scope, as well as those identified in implementing the current European Solidarity Corps and the EU Aid Volunteers. The evaluation indicated a need for the EU to address the following major challenges under an extended European Solidarity Corps. 10 Highlights and main documents can be found on the web page dedicated to the evaluations: https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/resources/documents.evaluations_en. 11 Final consolidated analysis is still pending. 12 [Pending reference to Financial Regulation]. ",
        "EN 7 EN \uf0b7 Communications: under the first phase of the European Solidarity Corps there has been some confusion among potential participants about its role. This especially concerns the underlying programmes that are part of phase 1 and the differences from the EU Aid Volunteers initiative; \uf0b7 Coherence: the two most visible EU volunteering schemes are separated; \uf0b7 Slow uptake of occupational activities: the traineeship and job activities being offered are fewer than anticipated; \uf0b7 Cooperating with national schemes: the cooperation with national frameworks, initiatives and schemes, such as civic service programmes or privately run initiatives, should be increased to avoid possible overlapping of programmes; \uf0b7 The inter-generational dimension: there is a disconnection between former, current and future participants. This translates into lost expertise that is not transmitted from one generation of participants to the next; \uf0b7 Community building: the skills gained through the European Solidarity Corps experience should not benefit only the projects already finished but should rather be shared among young people and beyond. The Corps is missing out on that knowledge and sharing of experiences; \uf0b7 Establishing a knowledge management system: from data collection to identification and dissemination of best practices in project management, the programme will need to better address this issue in order to increase the quality of reporting of results; \uf0b7 Simplifying the process and procedures governing the programme: improving access to e- forms and simplifying them would increase the offers by organisations. Challenges could arise from a complex Regulation or set of legislative acts that lack flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of the programme; \uf0b7 Deploying volunteers to humanitarian aid activities: one of the main challenges is the lengthy delay between the time candidates sign up and when they are deployed. All these challenges are further explained in the evaluation accompanying this proposal. These challenges are addressed by this Regulation. \u2022 Simplification This proposal introduces several simplifications, in three broad categories. \uf0b7 For individuals: extending the scope would mean that all volunteering and other solidarity- related activities are under one same programme. This will greatly simplify the access to opportunities for young people wanting to engage in a solidarity activity; \uf0b7 For organisations: aligning all rules of the programme, from application for accreditation to reporting requirements at the end of the project, will clearly simplify the work of the participating organisations at all stages of the project cycle. Also, the number of calls for proposals would be decreased, whi ch would reduce the organisations\u2019 workload ; \uf0b7 At institutional level: integrating activities currently implemented by the EU Aid Volunteers into the European Solidarity Corps will help simplify the work required for each element of the programme. For instance, one call for tender will be required instead of two for the insurance. Another example is the evaluation of proposals received at both national and centralised level, which would be combined while also catering for the specific features of each activity. In addition, further simplifications of existing procedures are considered. A good example is the electronic forms that organisations need to fill in to apply for funds or the quality label. These forms ",
        "EN 8 EN are constantly being simplified, requiring less work by organisations while at the same time remaining guarantees of the high quality of activities being offered. \u2022 Fundamental rights This proposal is fully in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU 13 , which acknowledges that solidarity is one of the universal values on which the EU is founded. In particular, this proposal takes into full account the rights and prohibitions laid down in the following articles of the Charter: \uf0b7 5 (Prohibition of slavery and forced labour); \uf0b7 14 (Right to education); \uf0b7 15 (Freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work); \uf0b7 21 (Non-discrimination); \uf0b7 23 (Equality between women and men); \uf0b7 24 (The rights of the child); \uf0b7 26 (Integration of persons with disabilities); \uf0b7 31 (Fair and just working conditions); and \uf0b7 32 (Prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work). Furthermore, the extension of the scope to include support to humanitarian aid operations in non-EU countries will help to deliver assistance, relief and protection activities on a non-discriminatory basis in these countries. In addition, some activities might be aimed at supporting vulnerable groups in non- EU countries civil society organisations working on migration related matters or provision of food and non-food items in the aftermath of a natural disaster. In any case, regardless of their aim, activities in support of humanitarian aid would further promote EU values, including the protection of fundamental rights, in the communities where the activities take place. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS In line with the Commission \u2019 s proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, the financial allocation for implementing the programme for that period will be set at EUR 1 260 000 000 at current prices 14 . Further details of the budgetary implications and the human and administrative resources required are provided in the Legislative and Financial Statement attached to this proposal. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The European Solidarity Corps will use the management and implementation arrangements already in place under the Erasmus+ programme. Doing so is in line with the analysis carried out in the ex ante evaluation that accompanies this proposal.

The reporting and assessment arrangements by all implementing bodies will ensure comprehensive monitoring of the implementation of the proposal. The programme will also be subject to an independent evaluation 4 years after the date of its adoption in order to assess the qualitative outcomes of the actions supported. This will include their impact on the young people and organisations involved, as well as the gains in efficiency observed over the first 4 years. The evaluation should take into account the existing evidence of the effectiveness and impact of the results of the Corps. The sources of verification will include the monitoring data, the information included in the work plans and reports from the implementing bodies, results arising from dissemination, evidence-based studies, surveys, etc. Evaluations will be carried out in line with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 15 , where the three institutions confirmed that evaluations of existing legislation and policy should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action. The evaluations will assess the programme's effects on the ground based on the programme indicators/targets and a detailed analysis of the degree to which the programme can be deemed relevant, effective, efficient, provides enough EU added value and is coherent with other EU policies.

Those activities should also support the mobility of young volunteers, trainees and workers. (6) The solidarity activities offered to young people should be of high quality, in the sense that they should respond to unmet societal needs, contribute to strengthening communities, offer young people the opportunity to acquire valuable knowledge and competences, be financially accessible to young people, and be implemented in safe and healthy conditions. (7) The European Solidarity Corps provides a single entry point for solidarity activities throughout the Union and beyond. Consistency and complementarity should be ensured with other relevant Union policies and programmes. The European Solidarity Corps is built on the strengths and synergies of predecessor and existing programmes, notably the European Voluntary Service 19 and the EU Aid Volunteers 20 . It also complements the efforts made by Member States to support young people and ease their school-to-work transition under the Youth Guarantee by providing them with additional opportunities to make a start on the labour market in the form of traineeships or jobs in solidarity-related areas within their respective Member State or across borders. Complementarity with existing Union level networks pertinent to the activities under the European Solidarity Corps, such as the European Network of Public Employment Services, EURES and the Eurodesk network, are also ensured. Furthermore, complementarity between existing related schemes, in particular national solidarity schemes and mobility schemes for young people, and the European Solidarity Corps should be ensured, building on good practices where appropriate. (8) With respect to the interpretation of related legislation at Union level, both the cross-border volunteering activities under the European Solidarity Corps and the volunteering activities that continue to be supported under Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 should be considered equivalent to those carried out under the European Voluntary Service. (9) The European Solidarity Corps opens up new opportunities for young people to carry out volunteering, traineeship or job activities in solidarity-related areas as well as to devise and develop solidarity projects based on their own initiative. These opportunities contribute to enhancing their personal, educational, social, civic and professional development. The European Solidarity Corps also supports networking activities for European Solidarity Corps participants and organisations as well as measures to ensure the quality of the supported activities and to enhance the validation of their learning outcomes. It will thus also contribute to European cooperation relevant to young people and raising awareness of its positive impact.

Such solidarity activities should include a solid learning and training dimension through relevant activities that can be offered to participants before, during and after the solidarity activity. (11) Volunteering activities (both within and beyond the Union) constitute a rich experience in a non- formal and informal learning context which enhances young people\u2019s personal, socio - educational and professional development, active citizenship and employability. Volunteering activities should not have an adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment, nor should they be seen as a substitute for it. The Commission and the Member States should cooperate regarding volunteering policies in the youth field via the open method of coordination. (12) Traineeships and jobs in solidarity-related areas can offer additional opportunities for young people to make a start on the labour market while contributing to addressing key societal challenges. This can help foster the employability and productivity of young people while easing their transition from education to employment, which is key to enhancing their chances on the labour market. The traineeship activities offered under the European Solidarity Corps follow the quality principles outlined in Council Recommendation on establishing a Quality Framework for Traineeships 21 . The traineeships and jobs offered constitute a stepping stone for young people to enter the labour market and are accompanied by adequate post-activity support. The traineeship and job activities are facilitated by relevant labour market actors, in particular public and private employment services, social partners and Chambers of Commerce, and are remunerated by the participating organisation. As participating organisations, they should apply for funding via the competent implementing body of the European Solidarity Corps in view of intermediating between the young participants and employers offering traineeship and job activities in solidarity sectors. (13) Young people\u2019s spirit of initiative is an important asset for society and for the labour market. The European Solidarity Corps contributes to fostering this aspect by offering young people the opportunity to devise and implement their own projects aimed at addressing specific challenges to the benefit of their local communities. These projects are an opportunity to try out ideas and support young people to be themselves drivers of solidarity actions. They also serve as a springboard for further engagement in solidarity activities and are a first step towards encouraging European Solidarity Corps participants to engage in self-employment or setting up associations, non-governmental organisations or other bodies active in the solidarity, non-profit and youth sectors. (14) Young people and organisations participating in the European Solidarity Corps should feel that they belong to a community of individuals and entities committed to enhancing solidarity across Europe. At the same time, participating organisations need support to strengthen their capacities to offer good quality activities to an increasing number of participants. The European Solidarity Corps supports networking activities aimed at strengthening young people and participating organisations\u2019 engagement in this community, at fostering a Eu ropean Solidarity Corps spirit, as well as at encouraging the exchange of useful practices and experience. These activities also contribute to raising awareness about the European Solidarity Corps among public and private actors as well as to collect feedback from participants and participating organisations on the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps. (15) Particular attention should be given to ensuring the quality of the activities and other opportunities offered under the European Solidarity Corps, in particular by offering training, 21 Council Recommendation of 15 March 2018 on a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships (OJ C 153, 2.5.2018, p. 1).

(16) To ensure the impact of European Solidarity Corps activities on the personal, educational, social, civic and professional development of the participants, the knowledge, skills and competences that are the learning outcomes of the activity should be properly identified and documented, in accordance with national circumstances and specificities, as recommended in Council Recommendation of 20 December 2012 on the validation of non-formal and informal learning 22 . (17) A quality label should ensure compliance of the participating organisations with the principles and requirements of the European Solidarity Corps, as regards their rights and responsibilities during all stages of the solidarity experience. Obtaining a quality label is a precondition for participation but should not automatically lead to funding under the European Solidarity Corps. (18) Any entity willing to participate in the European Solidarity Corps should receive a quality label provided that the appropriate conditions are fulfilled. The process that leads to the attribution of a quality label should be carried out on a continuous basis by the implementing bodies of the European Solidarity Corps. The attributed quality label should be reassessed periodically and could be revoked if, in the context of the checks to be performed, the conditions that led to its attribution were found to be no longer fulfilled. (19) An entity willing to apply for funding to offer activities under the European Solidarity Corps should have first received a quality label as a precondition. This requirement does not apply to natural persons seeking financial support on behalf of an informal group of European Solidarity Corps participants for their solidarity projects. (20) Participating organisations may perform several functions in the framework of the European Solidarity Corps. In a host function they will carry out activities related to receiving the participants, including the organisation of activities and providing guidance and support to participants during the solidarity activity, as appropriate. In a support function they will carry out activities in relation to the sending and the preparation of participants before departure, during and after the solidarity activity, including training and guiding participants to local organisations after the activity. (21) The scaling-up of European Solidarity Corps projects should be facilitated. Specific measures should be put in place to help promoters of European Solidarity Corps projects to apply for grants or develop synergies through the support of the European Structural and Investment Funds and the programmes relating to migration, security, justice and citizenship, health and culture. (22) European Solidarity Corps Resource Centres should assist the implementing bodies, the participating organisations and the young people taking part in the European Solidarity Corps in order to raise the quality of the implementation of the activities of the European Solidarity Corps as well as to enhance the identification and validation of competences acquired through these activities including through producing Youthpass certificates.

It offers public administrations 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts.

(28) Special attention should be given to ensuring that the activities supported by the European Solidarity Corps are accessible to all young people, notably the most disadvantaged ones. Special measures should be in place to promote social inclusion, the participation of disadvantaged young people, as well as to take into account the constraints imposed by the remoteness of a number of rural areas and of the outermost regions of the Union and the Overseas Countries and Territories.

(31) The types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation shall be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. For grants, this shall include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and scales of unit costs. (32) Third countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) may participate in the Programme in the framework of the cooperation established under the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which provides for the implementation of Union programmes by a decision under that agreement. Third countries may also participate on the basis of other legal instruments. This Regulation should grant the necessary rights for and access to the authorising officer responsible, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) as well as the European Court of Auditors to comprehensively exert their respective competences. The full participation of third countries in the Programme should be subject to the conditions laid down in specific agreements covering the participation of the third country concerned to the Programme. Full participation entails, moreover, the obligation to set up a national agency and managing some of the actions of the Programme at decentralised level. Individuals and entities from third countries that are not associated to the Programme should be able to participate in some of the actions of the Programme, as defined in the work programme and the calls for proposals published by the Commission.

The work programme should set out the measures needed for their implementation in line with the general and specific objectives of the Programme, the selection and award criteria for grants, as well as all other elements required. Work programmes and any amendments to them should be adopted by implementing acts in accordance with the examination procedure.

Such requirements should include specific, measurable and realistic indicators which can be measured over time as a basis for evaluating the effects of the Programme on the ground. (38) Appropriate outreach, publicity and dissemination of the opportunities and results of the actions supported by the Programme should be ensured at European, national and local level. Special attention should be paid to social enterprises encouraging them to support the European Solidarity Corps activities. The outreach, publicity and dissemination activities should rely on all the implementing bodies of the Programme, including, when relevant, with the support of other key stakeholders.

(41) In order to ensure efficient and effective implementation of this Regulation, the Programme should make maximum use of existing management arrangements already in place. The implementation of the Programme should therefore be entrusted to existing structures, namely the Commission and the national agencies designated for the management of the actions referred to in Chapter III of [New Erasmus Regulation]. The Commission should regularly consult key stakeholders, including participating organisations, on the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps. (42) In order to ensure sound financial management and legal certainty in each participating country, each national authority should designate an independent audit body.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.4.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative To establish a Corps of motivated young Europeans willing to engage - in their country or abroad - in volunteering activities, traineeships or jobs in solidarity- related areas. By 2027, the programme is expected to have offered opportunities to 350 000 young Europeans. To support organisations in carrying out accessible and high quality solidarity activities that are expected to contribute to addressing unmet societal needs, while enhancing young people\u2019s personal, educational, social, civic and professional development. 1.4.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. The European Solidarity Corps enhances the European dimension to solidarity. It will complement existing public and private policies, programmes and activities and this will not have competition or substitution effects. This complementary effect will be ensured since the Corps will address unmet societal needs, i.e. situations where needs among communities and citizens are \u2013 e.g. for reasons of lacking resources \u2013 not being met by the labour market or by existing volunteering or other types of solidarity programmes. Furthermore, as explained in the ex-ante evaluation, the EU added value of the proposal comes from a common quality standard in the opportunities offered; from solidarity, seen as a common European value; economies of scale and scope, achieved through the integration of both programmes; and consistency, by 36 As referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation.

        "EN 35 EN integrating all solidarity-related opportunities for young people within one programme. 1.4.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past The European Solidarity Corps draws on the rich and long-standing tradition and experience of Member States in activities that serve the public interest, e.g. through volunteering. Some Member States operate national civic service programmes offering young people the possibility to engage, others facilitate activities undertaken by civil society. At EU level, the European Voluntary Service (EVS) has provided volunteering opportunities for young people for 20 years, and policies and programmes such as the Youth Guarantee and the \u201cYour First EURES Job\u201d are helping young people get into traineeships and jobs. The EU Aid Volunteers initiative, launched in 2014, offers the opportunity to EU citizens to have a volunteering experience in a third country, supporting and contributing to the provision of humanitarian aid assistance where it is most needed. The European Solidarity Corps builds on the strengths and experience of these initiatives, thus benefiting from building on a solid, existing basis while expanding it in order to offer new opportunities, wider visibility and greater impact. The European Solidarity Corps will offer new opportunities in the field of humanitarian aid that will no longer be supported by the EU Aid Volunteers initiative (which will not continue after 2020), while simplifying access for interested young people and organisations. The European Solidarity Corps will continue offering a single, easily accessible entry point through its Portal, and will aim at the widest possible outreach to participating organisations and to the young people involved. It will also develop and enhance training available before an activity, as well as relevant support and the validation of learning outcomes after an activity. In order to ensure efficient and effective implementation, the European Solidarity Corps will make maximum use of existing management arrangements already in place. This will allow focusing on maximising delivery and performance while minimising administrative burden. For this reason, the implementation of the European Solidarity Corps will be entrusted to existing bodies, i.e. the European Commission, also through its Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA), and the national agencies designated for the management of the actions referred to in the Youth Chapter of [New Erasmus Regulation] establishing the Erasmus Programme. 1.4.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments The actions of the European Solidarity Corps are consistent with and complementary to a variety of relevant EU policies and programmes, in particular, but not limited to, those relating to education and training, employment, gender equality, entrepreneurship (in particular social entrepreneurship), citizenship and democratic participation, environment and nature protection, climate action, disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery, agriculture and rural development, provision of food and non-food items, health and well-being, creativity and culture, physical education and sport, social assistance and welfare, reception and integration of third-country nationals, territorial cooperation and cohesion, cooperation across borders and humanitarian aid.

The European Commission, partially also via the Education, Audio-visual and Culture Executive Agency, will manage actions to provide horizontal services to the European Solidarity Corps participants (i.e. portal, online training, online linguistic support, insurance) 37 Details of management modes and references to the Financial Regulation may be found on the BudgWeb site: https://myintracomm.ec.europa.eu/budgweb/EN/man/budgmanag/Pages/budgmanag.aspx ",

MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules Specify frequency and conditions. The monitoring and evaluation arrangements of the European Solidarity Corps will consist of permanent monitoring to assess progress and an evaluation to assess the existing evidence on the effectiveness of the results achieved. Monitoring arrangements will be based on an extensive analysis of the quantitative outputs and qualitative outcomes of the European Solidarity Corps. The quantitative outputs will be systematically collected through the IT systems put in place for the management of the actions of the European Solidarity Corps. The qualitative outcomes will be monitored through periodical surveys targeting both individuals and participating organisations. The reporting and assessment arrangements by all implementing bodies will ensure a comprehensive monitoring of the implementation of the proposal. The Programme will also be subject to an independent evaluation four years after the date of its adoption to assess the qualitative outcomes of the supported actions, including their impact on the young people and organisations, as well as the gains in efficiency observed throughout the first four years. The evaluation should take into account the existing evidence on the effectiveness and impact of the results of the European Solidarity Corps. The sources of verification will include the monitoring data, the information included in the work plans and reports from the implementing bodies, results arising from dissemination, evidence-based studies, surveys, etc. 2.2. Management and control system(s) 2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed In line with the analysis carried out in the context of the ex-ante evaluation that accompanies this proposal, and in order to ensure efficient and effective implementation, synergies and to minimise administrative burden, the European Solidarity Corps will use the existing management and implementation arrangements already in place under the Erasmus+ programme. Building on the positive experience of the implementation of this programme as well as on its structures, the proposal provides for a clear division of programme management tasks between the Commission, the national agencies established under the Erasmus+ Programme and the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). Since its founding in 2006, the EACEA has implemented parts of the Erasmus+, Creative Europe, Europe for Citizens and EU Aid Volunteers programmes (and their predecessor programmes), as confirmed by a number of independent external evaluations. EACEA is in the process of improving its procedures as a result of recommendations by the Internal Audit Service. In parallel, the successful model of national agencies under Erasmus+ has delivered demonstrable performance and efficiency, coupled with a high level of assurance and sound financial management. ",
        "EN 39 EN 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them The ex-ante evaluation identified six potential risks to be monitored: -There are not enough young people registered in the database with necessary motivation for solidarity activities. -Not enough offers from organisations or offers that do not match the interests of the young European Solidarity Corps participants. -Involved organisations to commit fraud of irregularities with received funds. -Fraud committed by participants leads to an increased cost of insurance overall. -Rapidly changing environment in a third country renders the deployment of a volunteer dangerous. -Dilution of humanitarian aid activities within the other European Solidarity Corps activities. For each of these risks, an analysis was conducted to assess their probability and the effect they would have in the programme should they be realised. In addition, mitigating measures have been suggested in the ex-ante evaluation for each risk. The control system for the initiative will be set up in a manner so as to ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the controls. The Commission's supervision and performance frameworks will ensure a high level of monitoring and feedback to inform the policy approach. 2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of \"control costs \u00f7 value of the related funds managed\"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) The Commission's estimate is that the global cost of control is low, and in the range 1-2%, depending on the measure used and of the budget managed (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency's budget excluded). These costs are proportional and cost effective given the likely risk of error if such controls were not in place, and the requirement to ensure an error rate below 2%. Based on the experience with the current European Solidarity Corps and its predecessor programme the European Voluntary Service, the expected risk of error is less than 2%. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy. The controls aimed at preventing and detecting fraud are not unlike those intended to ensure the legality and regularity of the transactions (the unintentional errors). Each year the Commission reviews all reporting from national agencies on possible fraud or irregularities. These cases are mainly followed up at national level where the national agencies have direct access to means of legal redress and referral of fraud cases. The Commission services contribute to ongoing OLAF investigations and organise the follow-up to completed OLAF investigations. Financial prejudice to the EU budget resulting from fraud established in final OLAF case reports concerning programmes with similar funding rules and stakeholders is low. Cases are referred to OLAF and to IDOC as appropriate, but a significant number of cases are followed up ",
        "EN 40 EN during the year directly with national agencies and national authorities, who have direct access to the relevant judicial and anti-fraud entities. Commission services implementing the action have developed and implemented their own anti-fraud strategy since 2014, elaborated on the basis of the methodology provided by OLAF. Regularly updated, it is supplemented with (most recently 2017), where appropriate, lower-level procedural documents, covering how cases are referred and followed up. As concluded in the mid-term evaluation of the Erasmus+ programme, given the fact that the scale of fraud within the programme is extremely limited and is largely restricted to cases of multiple project application submissions or project leaders failing to honour their obligations, the measures in place are considered both appropriate and proportionate. Considering the level of fraud impact potentially faced by the proposed programme, in particular the financial prejudice recorded by the European Anti-fraud Office, the residual risk of fraud does not justify additional measures. Commission services maintain close cooperation with OLAF and follow the ongoing cases closely. Therefore it is possible to conclude positively on assurance in respect of fraud risk. 3.

        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of 27 Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and Euratom based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017. \uf0b7 Reasons and objectives The European Union\u2019s aim is to promote peace, its values and the well -being of its peoples. The Union is a community of law and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. Article 2 of the Treaty of the EU states that \u2018 the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights, including the rights of the persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society where pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail \u2019 . These values underpin the rights enjoyed by those living in the Union. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights brings together in a single text all the personal, civic, political, economic and social rights enjoyed by people in the EU. Article 3 TEU states that the \u2018Union\u2019s aim is to promote peace, its values and the well -being of its peoples \u2019 and that \u2018it shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe\u2019s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced\u2019. T he Commission\u2019s reflection paper on the future of EU finances 1 states that \u2018the EU budget supports this aim, working together with national budgets and complementing other efforts at European and national level \u2019 . The Union\u2019s values encompass in particular fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equality, anti-racism and tolerance, respect for human dignity, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, cultural diversity, a vibrant civil society, freedom of expression and citizens \u2019 participation in democratic life. A working European area of Justice and effective national justice systems are necessary for a flourishing internal market and for upholding the common values of the Union. This Commission has set a Union of democratic change as one of its ten political priorities and is working in that context to engage citizens about what the EU does and the way it functions and to build trust in the Union. EU finances can provide value added and help in in upholding common European values. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have had a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Europe for Citizens programme and the Justice programme. These programmes have led to real progress in promoting values and implementing the rights that EU legislation grant to people across the Union. To give some examples, people are more aware of their rights, common history and culture, more women are in work, children \u2019s rights have been promoted and protected, justice systems are more effective with legal practitioners knowing how and when to apply EU acquis and with a thriving cross-border cooperation, 1 COM(2017)358 ",
        "EN 2 EN there is more democratic and civic participation at Union level, and a deeper understanding of and respect for different memories, cultures and traditions. Under Union law, people can rely on a set of rights, independent and effective justice systems, and respect for the rule of law. The EU has shown its firm commitment to combatting violence against women and children, fighting all forms of discrimination, promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities, and supporting a vibrant and strong civil society in the EU. Despite the progress achieved under the current programmes, several gaps persist in the policy areas in question and new challenges have emerged that need to be tackled. The common challenges faced by the EU in the area of justice, rights and values are twofold: \u2013 T he Union\u2019s vocation to b e a community based on shared values and rights, a shared historical and cultural heritage and people \u2019 s involvement, is hampered by some emerging movements which challenge the idea of open inclusive, cohesive and democratic societies where civic participation and the enjoyment of rights make it possible to build a tolerant way of living together. \u2013 The fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes dedicated to values, rights, citizenship and justice limits the EU \u2019s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. \u2018 Lack of budget of the programmes to satisfy demand \u2019 is a main obstacle that the respondents to the public consultation say could prevent the current programmes from achieving their objectives. A more detailed analysis shows that: \u2013 People still do not fully enjoy their rights: inequalities and discrimination on the grounds of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation still exist. Violence is still a reality in the daily lives of many women, children and other people at risk; \u2013 There is more to be done to make sure that citizens are aware of the values of the EU and the benefits of EU citizenship, and to encourage a higher level of political and societal participation and better understanding of the Union, its history, cultural heritage and diversity; \u2013 The rights stemming from EU citizenship \u2014 on free movement, consular protection and electoral rights \u2014 are still not fully known and implemented, thus hindering citizens \u2019 political and societal participation. \u2013 Economic crises, persisting inequalities and challenges such as of migration have led some to question the fundamental rights and the values on which the European Union is founded. In some cases, the rule of law, access to justice, space for civil society and the independence of the judiciary are also being challenged. \u2013 Judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters is insufficient and access to justice across Member States is still difficult. Tools for collecting comparative information about the quality, independence and efficiency of Member States \u2019 justice systems need to be improved. A major obstacle to mutual recognition and judicial cooperation is a lack of trust in other Member States \u2019 judicial systems. The consequences of not addressing these challenges could be serious as confidence in democracy and support for upholding values and fundamental rights would be weakened. ",
        "EN 3 EN These challenges are common to all Member States and have cross-border dimensions. While action at national level is important, individual Member States do not have sufficient leverage to tackle these challenges. Promoting and defending EU values and rights has profound implications for the political, social, cultural, judicial and economic life of the Union and contributes to the EU having a tangible impact on people \u2019s day-to-day lives. EU-level action at in this area needs to be sustained and stepped up in order to address persisting gaps and new challenges, and ensure the promotion, effective protection and respect of rights and values; this will also help to complete the internal market and foster prosperity and cohesion in the EU. It will also allow the EU to play a key role in defending and promoting its values at global level and contribute to the UN\u2019s s ustainable development goals. The new Justice programme will support the further development of a European area of justice based on the Union\u2019s values, the rule of law, and mutual recognition and trust, in particular by facilitating access to justice and promoting judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and the effectiveness of national justice systems. Together with the Rights and Values programme, this new programme will form part of a new Justice, Rights and Values \u2019 Fund, helping to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. It will also help to empower people by protecting and promoting rights and values and by further developing an EU area of justice. \uf0b7 Consistency with existing policy provisions The Justice Rights and Values Fund contributes directly to several of the European Commission \u2019s priorities 2 , in particular the creation of an area of justice and fundamental rights based on mutual trust, a deeper and fairer internal market, a capital markets union, a connected digital single market, and a Union of democratic change, growth and jobs. \uf0b7 Consistency with other Union policies The Justice, Rights and Values fund and its two underlying funding programmes will help to strengthen and uphold EU values and the respect of the rule of law and to sustain the open, democratic, inclusive and creative societies which Europeans expect. Already under current rules, Member States are required to show that their rules and procedures for financial management of EU money are robust and funding is sufficiently protected from abuse or fraud. Only an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law and legal certainty in all Member States can ultimately guarantee that money from the EU budget is sufficiently protected. On the basis of Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Commission has proposed a Regulation on the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The new Regulation will complement the instruments aiming at upholding EU common values, including this programme. The programme will have close synergies with several policies and their funding programmes, in particular: \u2013 employment, social and education policies 2 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/juncker-political-guidelines-speech_en.pdf ",
        "EN 4 EN Effective justice and enforcement capacity, e.g. through the training of legal practitioners; \u2013 external, development cooperation and enlargement policies The promotion of values and rights in the EU is mirrored by their promotion at global level, including through linkages with the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. In this respect, synergies should be developed, in particular with the EU's external action at multilateral level but also in development cooperation aid and in enlargement policy, to ensure coherence in the promotion, for instance, of access to justice and the rule of law. Synergies should also be strengthened with external action instruments that may support cross-border cooperation with priority non-EU countries in areas of importance for a safe and secure Europe. \u2013 single market By financing activities on company law, contract law and anti-money laundering, the future single market programme will complement the Justice programme and contribute directly to the implementation of EU policy in the field of justice and the creation of an EU area of justice, and will follow the policy lines in this area. The same applies as regards consumer policy; \u2013 strategic infrastructure Synergies relating to digitalisation and the interconnection of IT systems will be developed further under the Digital Europe programme; \u2013 research and Innovation The Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation includes activities addressing an Inclusive and Secure Society, including justice and consumer matters, and societally relevant technologies including cybersecurity or artificial intelligence and other key enabling technologies. Cross-fertilisation with the aim of deepening the understanding of advanced technologies in society, democracy and the judicial system, and how to focus on their benefits will be explored. \u2013 migration, border management and security policy The Justice programme and other EU funds covering migration, border management and especially security will dovetail by targeting different phases of the activities and procedures required to establish a European area of security and justice. Given the intrinsic connections between security and justice on the ground, there will be particular synergies in terms of providing adequate protection to crime victims, funding joint investigation teams and judicial training, ensuring interoperability with the European criminal records information system, improving detention conditions and inter-agency cooperation in the fields of justice and security, including via justice-related agencies such as Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor \u2019s Office. \u2013 environmental policy The Justice programme has the potential to support measures aimed at combatting environmental crime and, amongst others, contribute to implementation of the Environmental Crime Directive 3 . Measures to support judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters will complement and reinforce a separate programme for the 3 Directive 2008/99 ",

They will also contribute to ensuring that national justice systems can deliver effective access to justice under the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters 5 . \u2013 Climate mainstreaming The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. The contribution of this programme to the achievement of this overall target will be tracked through an EU climate marker system at an appropriate level of disaggregation, including the use of more precise methodologies where these are available. The Commission will continue to present the information annually in terms of commitment appropriations in the context of the annual draft budget. To support the full utilisation of the potential of the programme to contribute to climate objectives, the Commission will seek to identify relevant actions throughout the programme preparation, implementation, review and evaluation processes. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \uf0b7 Legal basis The proposal is based on Article 81(1) and (2) and Article 82(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 81(1) TFEU provides that the Union shall develop judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications. Article 81(2) TFEU provides for the adoption of measures aimed at ensuring the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments; the cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents; effective access to justice and support for the training of the judiciary and judicial staff. Article 82(2) TFEU provides for measures to promote judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The combination of Articles 81 and 82 TFEU allows for a comprehensive approach in supporting the development of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, especially cross-cutting issues affecting both fields. \uf0b7 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The proposed funding activities respect the principles of European added value and subsidiarity. Funding from the Union budget concentrates on objectives that cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone, where Union intervention can add value. Activities covered by this Regulation contribute to the effective application of the acquis by developing mutual trust between Member States, increasing cross-border cooperation and networking, and ensuring correct, coherent and consistent application of Union law across the 4 Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the establishment of a programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 614/2007 Text with EEA relevance 5 Decision 2005/370/EC. ",
        "EN 6 EN Union. The Union is better placed than Member States to address cross-border situations and to provide a European platform for mutual learning. A sound analytical basis for the support and development of policies will be supported. Union intervention allows for these activities to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies of scale. \uf0b7 Proportionality The proposal complies with the proportionality principle in that it does not go beyond the minimum required in order to achieve the stated objective at European level. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \uf0b7 Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation The mid-term evaluation of the 2014-2020 Justice programme shows that it has delivered high European added value. Member States acting alone would not be able to achieve the same results in terms of size and scope. This is true both for the general objective of the programme, i.e. the development of a European area of justice based on mutual recognition and trust, and for its specific objectives. Beneficiaries agree that providing judicial training at European level is essential to the creation of a European area of justice and for the smooth and coordinated enforcement of EU law. In turn, the action fostered by the judicial training specific objectives is considered sustainable, since it fosters the acquisition of lasting legal knowledge and competences, while providing for networking opportunities and trust-building among judicial staff from different Member States. The types of activity funded by the programme and the project outcomes are effective in improving knowledge of Union law and policies. The performance of the Justice programme is perceived as an improvement on the predecessor programmes, in terms both of policy targeting and involving the right stakeholder groups while the distribution of efforts amongst Programme objectives could be balanced in the future. Efforts are still needed to reach all target groups in all Member States and communication activities could be strengthened. The nature of the programme has made it possible to ensure operational flexibility, allowing the Commission to adapt the annual work programmes to emerging needs in the field of justice policy. Overall, the programme is highly relevant and aligned to the needs of selected target groups but a more systematic analysis of the stakeholder needs could be considered. In particular, it has the key ability to adapt its priorities to emerging needs in the area of justice policy, in order to address the most relevant issues. This is a product of the broad specific objectives of the programme; as it incorporated a number of programmes from the previous programming period. Such flexibility in terms of policy and agenda-setting is the key to the good results of the programme. . The Programme presents a good level of coherence and complementarity with other EU instruments, programmes and actions. Coordination and information exchange with other EU programmes and projects would be instrumental to further the coherence. The implementation of the Justice programme has been satisfactory as regards action grants and operational grants, but the forward planning of procurement actions should be improved. There is little scope for using alternative funding instruments such as innovative financial instruments. Beneficiaries consider the current instruments (action grants, operating grants and procurement activities) suitable for the needs of the programme. However, there is scope for streamlining and simplifying certain reporting requirements in the context of the grants, while ensuring the necessary control on spending public resources. ",
        "EN 7 EN The programme-specific indicators are suitable for monitoring progress towards the programme objectives, but are sometimes difficult to measure due to a lack of adequate tools (i.g. satisfaction survey). Participants \u2019 capacity was deemed a key factor influencing the performance of funded activities as limited (administrative, financial, organisational) capacity could be a reason for limited participation in the programme \u2019 s activities (especially in certain Member States). Capacity-building and technical assistance may therefore be required. There is no clear scope for further simplification as regards the management mode of the programme. The current direct management mode is appropriate for a programme of this size, while alternative modes (such as shared management) would probably result in resources being too thinly spread, reducing the programme \u2019s capacity to concentrate resources on common priorities and emerging issues. Simplification could be sought, according to beneficiaries, with regard to the drafting and provision of necessary administrative and financial capacity information when participating in calls for proposals. Further, there is scope for tailoring the Participants Portal to the needs of the various types of organisation that typically apply to the programme (such as training institutions). In this regard, the trend towards gradual digitalisation was viewed as clearly positive and should be continued. ",
        "EN 8 EN \uf0b7 Stakeholder consultations The consultation strategy supporting the preparatory work for the new Justice programme included a public consultation in the framework of the proposal for the post-2020 multiannual financial framework (MFF) in the area of values and mobility, public consultations in the framework of the mid-term evaluation of the current funding programmes, and several ad hoc consultations organised by the Commission in the form of roundtable discussions with stakeholders, conferences and seminars on the issues covered by the impact assessment, which largely builds on the outcome of these consultations. O PEN PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU FUNDS IN THE AREA OF VALUES AND MOBILITY Consultations have taken place in the context of evaluations of existing EU financial programmes covering several policy areas and notably looked at current performance and future challenges. The purpose of the public consultation on EU funds in the area of values and mobility was to collect the views of all interested parties on how to make the most of every euro of the EU budget. The public consultation on EU funds in the area of values and mobility was open from 10 January 2018 to 9 March 2018 in 23 official EU languages. In response to the online public consultation on EU funds in the area of values and mobility, the Commission received a total of 1 839 replies from all over Europe. Of these, 52% were from respondents with experience of Erasmus+ and 43% were from respondents with experience of the Creative Europe programme. There was at least one response from each Member State, The country of residence with the most contributions overall was Germany (24.4%), followed by France (8.7%), Belgium (7.7%) and Spain (5.4%). Of the 1 839 contributions received via the online questionnaire, 65.2 % (1 199) were from organisations and 34.8 % (640) from individuals. A wide range of stakeholders shared their opinions: of the 1 199 contributions from organisations, 355 (19.3%) were from non-governmental organisations, platforms or networks, 270 (14.7%) from private enterprises (mainly micro and small businesses) and 127 (6.9%) from researchers and academics. The analysis summed up below focuses on the respondents with experience of the following EU programmes: 1. Europe for Citizens programme and/or 2. Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme and/or 3. Creative Europe programme and/or 4. Justice programme. Below are some of the main results: \u2013 According to the respondents, \u2018Promoting European identity and common values\u2019 and \u2018promoting rights and equality\u2019 are important common policy challenges (among the first four challenges mentioned) to be addressed in each of the four programmes. \u2018Supporting active citizenship, democratic participation in society and the rule of law\u2019 and \u2018Promoting social inclusion and fairness\u2019 also appear to be important challenges to be addressed in the relevant programmes but to a lesser extent in the Creative Europe programme, for which economic challenges and cultural diversity are more important. \u2013 \u2018Supporting innovation\u2019, \u2018Fostering European cultural diversity and cultural heritage\u2019, \u2018Promoting European identity and common values\u2019 are considered policies that ",
        "EN 9 EN address fully or fairly well the challenges faced by half or more of the respondents with experience of the four programmes concerned. Also, 52 % of the respondents with experience of the Creative Europe programme consider that the policy to \u2018Support competitiveness of European cultural and creative sectors\u2019 addresses the challenges fully or fairly well. \u2013 Around 80 % of the respondents with experience of the four EU programmes mentioned above agree that these programmes add value to a large extent or to a fairly good extent to what Member States could achieve at national, regional and/or local level. \u2013 The main obstacles identified by the respondents that could prevent the current programmes/funds from achieving their objectives are very similar regardless of the programme concerned: \u2018Lack of budget of the programmes to satisfy demand\u2019; \u2018Insufficient support provided to small- scale stakeholders\u2019; \u2018Lack of support to first - time applicants\u2019 are identified as the main three obstacles. \u2013 Respondents with experience of one or more of the four EU programmes agree that \u2018the use of more simplified application forms\u2019, \u2018facilitati ng structured network and partnerships\u2019, \u2018facilitating funding for actions cutting across the sectors of action\u2019 and \u2018better coordination between different programmes/funds\u2019 are the main steps to be taken to simplify and reduce the administrative burden for beneficiaries. \uf0b7 Impact assessment The impact assessment was prepared to analyse a possible proposal for a European Culture, Rights and Values programme merging the 2014-2020 Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Europe for Citizens programme and the Creative Europe programme \u2014 and the Justice programme. The Commission decided to have a self-standing Creative Europe programme and to create a Justice, Rights and Values Fund with two underlying funding programmes: the Justice programme and the Rights and Values programme. The impact assessment remains valid in underpinning all these initiatives. On 20 April 2018, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board gave a positive opinion on the accompanying impact assessment. The Board included a recommendation to further improve the report, some key aspects of this being full exploitation of the evaluation results and findings outcomes, a better design of the future priorities and clarification of the expected impacts of the changes in delivery mechanisms. These aspects were strengthened in the final version of the impact assessment. The impact assessment compiled the lessons learned from the Creative Europe programme, the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Europe for Citizens programme and the Justice programme and proposed a new structure. It also explored delivery mechanisms that will promote EU values and culture while achieving the objectives of efficiency, flexibility, synergies and simplification set for the next multiannual financial framework. The results of the mid-term evaluation have been duly taken into account. All the programmes evaluated have shown clear added value. With the new clustering, it will be possible to further exploit the potential of current programmes to promote EU values and increase EU added value. Three main scenarios were analysed: \u2013 The status quo of maintaining four funding programmes under the \u2018v alues \u2019 sub-cluster of the EU budget, namely the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Justice programme, the Creative Europe programme and the Europe for Citizens programme. ",
        "EN 10 EN \u2013 As an alternative to the current situation and baseline scenario, the second scenario proposed developing synergies among the current programmes and combining them to form a single political chapeau on EU values with two underlying funding programmes: the European Culture, Rights and Values programme and the Justice programme. \u2013 A third scenario involved the creation of one single funding programme covering all four funding programmes listed above. The baseline scenario: the status quo with four funding programmes and a proportional 15 % budgetary cut Analysis of the baseline scenario with a possible 15 % cut in the available funding shows that there would be negative consequences for policy implementation. In particular: A 15 % reduction in funding for the REC programme would result in an annual prioritisation, i.e. concentration of funding in some policy areas in one year and promotion of other policy areas in the following years, in contradiction with the increasing needs in the field. This reduction would also mean cutting back on studies, data collection, awareness-raising campaigns etc., all necessary to have sound, evidence-based policy and legislation. For the Europe for Citizens programme , a budgetary cut of 15 % would reduce the baseline budget to \u20ac157 million which is insufficient for the Commission \u2019 s commitment to put citizens at the centre of the European process. The critical mass of participants and the geographical coverage of activities necessary to achieve the intended impact would no longer be reached. A stable budgetary allocation (based on the 2017 budget) would allow continuity but still have limited impact. A decrease of 15 % in funding for the MEDIA sub-programme of Creative Europe would inevitably mean streamlining and concentrating on a limited number of actions. A reduction in funding would disproportionately impact lower production countries and/or countries with a restricted geographic/linguistic area. It would also reduce the number of training activities for audio visual professionals and the number of EU co-productions, which are works that travel better across borders. Reducing the scope of the network of cinema operators would negatively impact the access of EU citizens, notably from Central and Eastern European countries, to non-national European content. A decrease of 15 % for the Culture sub-programme of Creative Europe would not make it possible to reach a critical mass to respond to the needs of the cultural and creative sectors. This would imply in particular less European added value and therefore a reduced impact on cultural diversity, fewer opportunities for cross-border cooperation, fewer market opportunities and fewer career possibilities for practitioners from the cultural and creative sectors. The societal impact would be reduced, and the international opening of the programme might need to be limited to its pre-2014 level and the participation of key EU neighbouring partner countries abandoned. The Financial Guarantee for the cultural and creative sectors could be put at risk, which would be detrimental to the Cultural and Creative Sectors, especially for Eastern countries in whose financial markets are less developed and where therefore there are therefore fewer possibilities to access to finance. Discarded alternative in the impact assessment: one programme For reasons related to the legal basis, the alternative proposed in the third scenario of a single instrument/programme has been discarded. Indeed, most of the activities and policies are based on articles that provide for an ordinary legislative procedure except for the current ",
        "EN 11 EN Europe for Citizens programme. Currently, the main focus of the Europe for Citizens programme is on civic participation and is therefore based on Article 352 TFEU (unanimity). After analysis, the objectives of the corresponding activities could, if their focus was modified to a certain degree, be adapted to fit with the new approach of a broader programme; in such case, they would fall within the scope of Article 167(1) and (2) TFEU, which provides for the ordinary legislative procedure. However, given the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland on the area of freedom, security and justice and the position of Denmark as laid down in Protocols 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaties, the Justice programme, while also commanding the ordinary legislative procedure, needs to remain a separate instrument. Proposed alternative in the impact assessment: an EU Values framework with two funding programmes The analysis shows that there is room for improvement in relation to the current situation of four funding programmes. Therefore, as an alternative to the current situation and baseline scenario, it is proposed that synergies be developed among the current programmes and prerogative lines and combined into a single political chapeau on EU values with two underlying funding programmes: the European Culture, Rights and Values programme and the Justice programme, as presented below: The new architecture of the future funding as an alternative to the baseline scenario aims at: \u2013 developing synergies among policies, finding a common ground for action, while respecting their specific features; \u2013 reducing overlap and fragmentation; \u2013 ensuring flexibility in the allocation of funds, while ensuring a certain degree of predictability of funding dedicated to each policy; \u2013 fostering cross-sectoral and innovative actions; \u2013 ensuring a critical mass of resources to promote values, taking also into account the needs of each policy. Retained alternative The Commission decided to have a self-standing Creative Europe programme and to create a Justice, Rights and Values Fund including two programmes: the Justice programme and the Rights and Values programme. The impact assessment remains valid in underpinning these initiatives. This decision is reflected in the post-2020 MFF proposal package that the Commission presented on 02 May 2018 6 . \uf0b7 Simplification Simplification measures, e.g. lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, will be sought in the implementation of the Justice programme. The complexity and heterogeneity of the funding rules for the current programmes represent an obstacle for applicants. The use of a single entry point for external users to participate in the grants lifecycle (the participant portal), including an overall grant management system, has an important role to play in simplifying access to the programme. The Justice programme will continue to be managed through the Commission \u2019s IT corporate system developed currently on the basis of H2020. \uf0b7 Fundamental rights 6 COM(2018)321. ",

OTHER ELEMENTS \uf0b7 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The Commission will continue to manage the Justice programme directly for both grants and procurements. An implementation plan will be developed to specify the arrangements for the running of the programme. A monitoring and evaluation plan will be developed to specify how actions are to be carried out in practice, and under what data strategy. The programme will be monitored both continuously (e.g. to respond in a timely manner to unforeseen events and exceptional needs) and on a regular basis (to report on key events such as calls for proposals, project reviews, coordination and dissemination events) and, where relevant, the monitoring will feed into the key programme indicators. The monitoring reports will subsequently feed into: \u2013 a mid-term evaluation (no later than four years after the start of programme implementation), combined with the final evaluation of the predecessor programmes; and \u2013 a final evaluation (no later than four years after the end of the programming period). These evaluations will be carried out in line with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 7 , where the three institutions confirmed that evaluations of existing legislation and policy should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action. The evaluations will assess the programme's effects on the ground on the basis of programme indicators/targets and a detailed analysis of the degree to which the programme can be deemed relevant, effective and efficient, provides enough EU added value and is coherent with other EU policies. They will include lessons learnt for addressing any shortcomings/problems identified or any potential to improve actions or results further and for maximising their exploitation/impact. The Commission will report to the European Parliament, Council and all other relevant EU institutions through monitoring and evaluation reports and a public scoreboard of the key programme indicators. \uf0b7 Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal The aim of the proposed approach is to combine the simplification of funding procedures, as requested by all involved parties, with a more results-oriented approach. 7 Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016; OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1 \u2013 14.

In implementing this Regulation, the Commission will establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. Participation is open to all legal entities legally established in a Member State or in a participating non-EU country, with no further restrictions on access to the programme. This structure allows for simplification and for the programme to be more closely geared to policy needs and developments. Moreover, it provides a stable context for evaluation, as the specific objectives are directly linked to indicators that will remain consistent for the duration of the programme and will be monitored and evaluated regularly.

The ultimate objective is to nurture and sustain our rights-based, equal, inclusive and democratic society. That includes a vibrant civil society, encouraging people \u2019 s democratic, civic and social participation and to fostering the rich diversity of European society, also based on our common history and memory. Article 11 of the EU Treaty further specifies that the institutions shall, by appropriate means, give citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known and publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action. (4) The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, with respect for fundamental rights and the different legal systems and traditions of the Member States. To that end, the Union may adopt measures to develop judicial cooperation in civil matters and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and to promote and support the action of Member States in the field of crime prevention. Respect for fundamental rights as well as for common principles and values, such as non-discrimination, gender equality, effective access to justice for all, the rule of law and a well-functioning independent judicial system shall be ensured in the further development of a European area of justice. (5) Financing should remain one of the important tools for the successful implementation of the ambitious goals set by the Treaties. They should be attained inter alia by establishing a flexible and effective Justice Programme which should facilitate planning and implementation of those goals. (6) For the gradual establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, the Union is to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions, which is a cornerstone of judicial cooperation within the Union since the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999. Mutual recognition requires a high level of mutual trust among Member States. Measures to approximate the laws of the Member States in several areas have been adopted to facilitate mutual recognition and foster mutual trust. A well-functioning area of justice, where obstacles in cross-border judicial proceedings and access to justice in cross-border situations are eliminated, is also key to ensure economic growth. (7) Respect for the rule of law is essential for a high level of mutual trust in the area of justice and home affairs, in particular for effective judicial cooperation in civil and 10 Regulation (EU) No 1381/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme for the period 2014 to 2020 ( OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 62) 11 Council Regulation (EU) No 390/2014 of 14 A pril 2014 establishing the \u2018Europe for Citizens\u2019 programme for the period 2014-2020 (OJ L 115, 17.4.2014, p.3) 12 Regulation (EU) No 1381/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme for the period 2014 to 2020 (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 62).

The rule of law is one of the common values enshrined in Article TEU 2, and the principle of effective judicial protection provided for in Articles 19(1) TEU and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a concrete expression of the rule of law. Promoting the rule of law by supporting the efforts to improve the independence, quality and efficiency of national justice systems enhances the mutual trust which is indispensable for judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. (8) Pursuant to Articles 81(2)(h) and 82(1)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the Union shall support the training of the judiciary and judicial staff as a tool to improve judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and of judicial decisions. Training of justice professionals is an important tool to develop a common understanding of how best to uphold the rule of law. It contributes to the building of the European area of justice by creating a common judicial culture among justice professionals of the Member States. It is essential to ensure the correct and coherent application of law in the Union and mutual trust between justice professionals in cross-border proceedings. The training activities supported by the Programme should be based on sound training needs \u2019 assessments, use state of the art training methodology, include cross-border events gathering justice professionals of different Member States, comprise active learning and networking elements and be sustainable. (9) Judicial training can involve different actors, such as Member States \u2019 legal, judicial and administrative authorities, academic institutions, national bodies responsible for judicial training, European-level training organisations or networks, or networks of court coordinators of Union law. Bodies and entities pursuing a general European interest in the field of training of the judiciary, such as the European Judicial Training Network ('EJTN'), the Academy of European Law ('ERA'), the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary ('ENCJ'), the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union ('ACA-Europe'), the Network of the Presidents of Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union ('RPCSJUE') and the European Institute of Public Administration ('EIPA'), should continue to play their role in promoting training programmes with a genuine European dimension for the judiciary and judicial staff, and could therefore be granted adequate financial support in accordance with the procedures and the criteria set out in the annual work programmes adopted by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation. (10) The programme should support the annual work programme of EJTN, which is an essential actor of judicial training. The EJTN is in a exceptional situation, insofar as it is the only network at Union level gathering the judicial training bodies of the Member States. It is in a unique position to organise exchanges for new and experienced judges and prosecutors between all Member States and to coordinate the work of the national judicial training bodies regarding the organisation of training activities on Union law and the promotion of good training practices. The EJTN is also a provider of training activities of excellent quality delivered in a cost-efficient manner at Union level. Moreover, it comprises the judicial training bodies of candidate countries as observer members. (11) Measures under the Programme should support enhanced mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments and the necessary approximation of legislation that will facilitate cooperation between all the relevant authorities, including Financial Intelligence Units, and the judicial protection of individual rights in civil and commercial matters. The Programme should also advance the procedural legislation ",

Finally, in order to support the effective enforcement and practical application of the Union law on judicial cooperation in civil matters, the Programme should support the functioning of the European Judicial Network in Civil and Commercial matters established by Council Decision 2001/470/EC. (12) Pursuant to Article 3(3) of the TEU, Article 24 of the Charter and the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Programme should support the protection of the rights of the child, and should mainstream the promotion of the rights of the child in the implementation of all of its actions. (13) The 2014-2020 Programme has enabled training activities on Union law, in particular on the scope and application of the Charter, targeted at members of the judiciary and other legal practitioners. In its conclusions of 12 October 2017 on the application of the Charter in 2016, the Council recalled the importance of awareness-raising on the application of the Charter, including among policymakers, legal practitioners and the rights holders themselves, at national as well as at Union level. Therefore, to mainstream fundamental rights in a consistent way, it is necessary to extend financial support to awareness \u2013 raising activities for other public authorities than judicial authorities and legal practitioners. (14) Pursuant to Article 67 TFEU, the Union should constitute an area of freedom, security and justice with respect for fundamental rights, to which access to justice is instrumental. In order to facilitate effective access to justice, and with a view to foster the mutual trust which is indispensable for the good functioning of the area of freedom, security and justice, it is necessary to extend financial support to activities of other authorities than judicial authorities and legal practitioners, as well as of civil society organisations, which contribute to these objectives. (15) Pursuant to Articles 8 and 10 TFEU, the Programme should also support the mainstreaming of equality between women and men and non-discrimination objectives in all its activities. (16) Actions covered by this Regulation should contribute to the creation of a European area of justice, increasing cross-border cooperation and networking and achieving the correct, coherent and consistent application of Union law. Funding activities should also contribute to a com mon understanding of the Union\u2019s values, the rule of law, to better knowledge of Union law and policies, to sharing know-how and best practices in using judicial cooperation instruments by all concerned stakeholders, as well as to a proliferation of interoperable digital solutions underpinning seamless and efficient cross-border cooperation, and should provide a sound analytical basis to support the development, enforcement and proper implementation of Union law and policies. Union intervention allows for those actions to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies of scale. Moreover, the Union is in a better position than Member States to address cross-border situations and to provide a European platform for mutual learning. (17) The Commission should ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with the work of Union bodies, offices and agencies, such as EUROJUST, EU-LISa and the European Public Prosecutor Office, and should take stock of the work of other national and international actors in the areas covered by the Programme.

Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll- out of the implementation of the initiative Whereas legislation is a key tool to implement the Union\u2019s objectives in the area of Justice, it needs to be complemented by other means. In this context, funding has an important role to play. In particular, funding should enhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of citizens, professionals and stakeholders, through supporting: - information and public awareness raising, including support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights, as guaranteed under Union law, and how to enforce them in practice; - training and capacity building for legal professionals (such as judges and prosecutors) and other practitioners, to equip them with the tools to effectively put Union rights and policies into practice. Funding also has a central role in promoting cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through: - strengthening networks, i.e. Union-wide organisations to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in this area, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe; - cross-border cooperation on enforcement, for example establishing missing child alert systems, coordination of operational and cross-border anti-drug cooperation. Additionally, funding should support: - Research, analysis and other support activities, to provide to the legislator clear and detailed information on the problems and the situation on the ground. The results of these activities 22 ABM: activity-based management; ABB: activity-based budgeting. 23 As referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation. ",
        "EN 29 EN feed into the development and the implementation of Union policies and ensure that they are evidence-based, well targeted and well structured. All these activities will be implemented over the whole period 2021-2027. It is difficult to set a precise roll-out at this stage, considering the speed of new political challenges we have to face and react to. 1.4.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. Reasons for action at European level (ex-ante) Funding covered by the Justice Programme concentrates on activities where the Union\u2019s intervention can bring additional value compared to action of Member States alone. Activities covered by this Regulation contribute to the effective application of the acquis by developing mutual trust between Member States, increasing cross-border cooperation and networking and achieving correct, coherent and consistent application of Union law across the Union. Only action at Union level can provide coordinated activities that can reach all Union Member States. The European Union is in a better position than Member States to address cross-border situations and to provide a European platform for mutual learning. Without Union support, stakeholders would tend to address similar problems in a fragmented and disconnected way. Expected generated Union added value (ex-post) Collaboration and networking between stakeholders will lead to the dissemination of best practices, in particular innovative and integrated approaches in different Member States. The participants in these activities will then act as multipliers in their respective professional activities and disseminate wider the best practices within their Member State. A sound analytical basis for the support and the development of policies will be supported. European Union intervention allows for these activities to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies of scale. Funding at national level would not provide the same results, but only a fragmented and limited approach not covering the needs of the European Union as a whole. 1.4.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past The mid-term evaluation carried out for the current programme in the area of justice has confirmed the overall effectiveness of the programme and the validity of its objectives, but some aspects have been identified for improvement, in particular the increase of the Programme's basin of potential recipients of the actions, the revision of the monitoring indicators, the strengthening of synergies with other relevant EU funding programmes and initiatives. 1.4.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments The Programme will seek synergies, consistency and complementarities with other Union instruments, inter alia with the programmes in the areas of migration, border management and security, consumers, employment, social and education, external development and cooperation. Duplication with activities under these other programmes will be avoided, and resources may be shared between the Justice programme and the Rights and Values Programme to achieve common objectives.

        "EN 31 EN 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules Specify frequency and conditions. The proposal includes monitoring and evaluation obligations. Achievement of the specific objectives will be monitored on the basis of the indicators contained in the proposal; on an annual basis. Furthermore, an interim evaluation report on the achievement of the Programme\u2019s objectives, the efficiency of the use of resources and its European added value will be provided by the Commission by mid-2025 at the latest. An ex post evaluation on the longer-term impacts and the sustainability of the effects of the Programme will be provided after the end of the Programme. 2.2. Management and control system 2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed Through direct management, the Commission supports other actions that contribute to the common policy objectives of the Union. The Justice Programme will be managed directly by the Commission as this allows to better adapt the programmes to the needs of the policy and to have more flexibility to re-adjust priorities in case of emerging needs. Besides Direct management by the Commission will also allow to establish direct contacts with beneficiaries/contractors directly engaged in activities that serve Union policies. The interim evaluation of the Justice Programme 2014-2020 concluded that while there is indeed scope for simplification within the Justice Programme, this scope is limited within the current management framework. However the broader use of the corporate IT tools for grant management and the broader introduction of unit costs in the Programme management will be factors of simplification. 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them The main risks linked to DG JUST financing activities are twofold: - the risk of not financing the best project to address the issue identified - the risks of irregularity and illegality of the costs claimed and reimbursed. As regards the legality and regularity risk, based on the main causes and types of most commonly detected errors in ex-post audits, it appears that the main areas of irregularities stem from poor financial management by the beneficiaries, mainly due to a poor understanding of the rules due to their complexity in particular for the eligibility of the costs. Consequently the risks are mainly due to \u2013 ensuring quality of selected projects and their subsequent technical implementation; \u2013 Risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded, both for grants (complexity of reimbursing actual eligible costs) and for procurement (sometimes limited number of economic providers with the required specialist knowledge entailing insufficient possibilities to compare price offers); \u2013 Fraud The residual error rate in 2017 (for grants) is estimated at 2.63%. ",
        "EN 32 EN Most of these risks are expected to be reduced thanks to: - a better design of calls for proposals - a better guidance to beneficiaries and targeting of proposals - the increased use of simplified costs as provided in the new Financial Regulation - the use of the corporate systems for the management of proposals and grants - the measures foreseen in anti-fraud strategy. Description of internal control system The control system envisaged for the future programme is a continuation of the current control system. In order to limit the risks and decrease the error rate, the control strategy will be based on the new Financial Regulation and on the Common Provision Regulation. The new Financial Regulation and the draft proposal for the Justice programme should extend the use of the simplified forms of grants such as lump-sums, flat rates and unit costs. The control strategy is composed of different building blocks: - programming, evaluation and selection of proposals in order to ensure that only the best proposals are funded; - Conclusion and monitoring of the grant agreements: All transactions and procedures are subject to an ex ante verification by the Programme and financial management Unit of DG JUST, as well as the relevant policy units. The financial verification is done by Programme and financial management Unit. For grants, cost claims are verified thoroughly, and supporting documents are requested when deemed necessary, based on a risk assessment. - ex post audits assured via a Service Level Agreement with DG HOME: The ex-post control sector applies a \"detection strategy\" aimed at detecting a maximum of anomalies in view of recovering undue payments. Based on this strategy, the audits are carried out on a sample of projects selected almost entirely on the basis of a risk analysis. Ex-Post controls should also rely on cross-reliance for audits and sharing available information to further reduce administrative burden and increase cost-effectiveness (Art 127 & 128 new FR) With this different elements the control strategy the error rate can be expected to be under the 2% materiality threshold. The cost of controls amounts to approximately 4,49% of the payments done by DG JUST. This is expected to stay stable or slightly decrease in the case where the use of simplified cost options (SCO) will be broadened in the next programming period. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy. DG JUST has approved an Anti-Fraud Strategy in April 2018. The DG will continue to apply its Anti-Fraud Strategy in line with the Commission's Anti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS) in order to ensure inter alia that its internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CAFS and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk areas and adequate responses.

        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of 27 Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and Euratom based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017. \uf0b7 Reasons and objectives The European Union\u2019s aim is to promote peace, its values and the well -being of its people. The Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In particular, Article 2 of the Treaty of the European Union states that \u2018 the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights, including the rights of the persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society where pluralism, non- discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail \u2019 . Article 3 further specifies that the \u2018 Union \u2019 s aim is to promote peace, its values and the well- being of its people \u2019 and, among others, \u2018 it shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe \u2019 s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced \u2019 . Along these lines, the Commission \u2019 s reflection paper on the future of EU finances 1 states that \u2018 the EU budget supports this aim, working together with national budgets and complementing other efforts at European and national level \u2019 . Those values encompass in particular fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equality, anti-racism and tolerance, the respect for human dignity, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, cultural diversity, a vibrant civil society, freedom of expression and citizen participation in democratic life. Furthermore, a sense of belonging to a common cultural heritage, memory and remembrance is a necessary pre-condition for participating in a democratic community and removing stereotypes and divisions between Europeans. This Commission has set a Union of democratic change as one of its ten political priorities and is working in that context to engage citizens about what the EU does and the way it functions and to build trust in the Union. EU finances can provide added value and help to uphold common European values. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Europe for Citizens programme, and the Justice programme. These programmes have led to real, progress in promoting values and implementing the set of rights that EU legislation grants to people across the Union. To give some examples, people are more aware of their rights, common history and culture, more women are in work, children \u2019s rights have been promoted and protected, justice systems are more effective with legal practitioners knowing how and when to apply EU acquis and 1 COM(2017) 358 of 28 June 2017. ",
        "EN 3 EN with a thriving cross-border cooperation, there is more democratic and civic participation at Union level, and a deeper understanding of and respect for different memories, cultures and traditions. Under Union law, people can rely on a set of rights, on an independent and effective justice system and the respect of the rule of law. Through dedicated funds, the EU has shown its firm commitment to combatting violence against women and children, fighting all forms of discrimination, promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities and supporting a vibrant and strong civil society in the EU. Despite the progress achieved under the current programmes, several gaps persist in the policy areas in question and new challenges have emerged that need to be tackled. The common challenges the EU faces with justice, rights and values are twofold: \u2013 The Union\u2019s vocation to b e a community based on shared values and rights, a shared historical and cultural heritage and people \u2019 s involvement is hampered by some emerging movements which challenge the idea of open, inclusive, cohesive and democratic societies where civic participation and the enjoyment of rights make it possible to build a tolerant way of living together. \u2013 The fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes dedicated to values, rights, citizenship and justice limits the EU \u2019s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. \u2018 Lack of budget of the programmes to satisfy demand \u2019 is a main obstacle that the respondents to the public consultation say could prevent the current programmes from achieving their objectives. A more detailed analysis also shows the following: \u2013 People still do not fully enjoy their rights: inequalities and discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation still exist. Violence is still a reality in the daily lives of many women, children and other people at risk. \u2013 There is more to be done to make sure that citizens are aware of the values of the EU and the benefits of EU citizenship, and to encourage a higher level of political and societal participation and better understanding of the Union, its history, cultural heritage and diversity; \u2013 The rights stemming from EU citizenship \u2014 on free movement, consular protection and electoral rights \u2014 are still not fully known and implemented, thus hindering citizens \u2019 political and societal participation. \u2013 Economic crises, persisting inequalities and challenges such as of migration have led some to question the fundamental rights and the values on which the European Union is founded are being put to the test. In some cases, the rule of law, access to justice, space for civil society and the independence of the judiciary are also being challenged. \u2013 Judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters is insufficient, and access to justice across Member States is still difficult. Tools for collecting comparative information about the quality, independence and efficiency of Member States\u2019 justice systems n eed to be improved. A main obstacle to mutual recognition and judicial cooperation is the lack of trust in the judicial systems of other Member States. The consequences of not addressing these challenges could be serious as confidence in democracy and support for upholding values and fundamental rights would be weakened. ",
        "EN 4 EN These challenges are common to all Member States and have cross-border dimensions. While action at national level is important, individual Member States alone do not have sufficient leverage to tackle these challenges. Promoting and defending EU values and rights has profound implications for the political, social, cultural, judicial and economic life of the Union and contributes to the EU having a tangible impact on people \u2019s day-to-day lives. EU-level action at in this area needs to be sustained and stepped up in order to address persisting gaps and new challenges, and ensure the promotion, effective protection and respect of rights and values; this will also help to complete the internal market and foster prosperity and cohesion in the EU. It will also allow the EU to play a key role in defending and promoting its values at global level and contribute to the UN\u2019s s ustainable development goals. In the light of the above, the new funding programme \u2018 Rights and Values \u2019 will aim at protecting and promoting rights and values as enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by supporting civil society organisations, in order to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies. This new programme, together with the Justice programme, will be part of a new Justice, Rights and Values Fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. It will also help to empower people by protecting and promoting rights and values and by further developing an EU area of justice. \uf0b7 Consistency with existing policy provisions The Justice Rights and Values Fund contributes directly to several of the European Commission \u2019s priorities 2 , in particular, the creation of an area of justice and fundamental rights based on mutual trust, a deeper and fairer internal market and a Union of democratic change, growth and jobs. The new programme is consistent with the European Pillar of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 17 November 2017. The Pillar is about delivering new and more effective rights for citizens, building upon 20 key principles including among others gender equality, equal opportunities, support to children or inclusion of people with disabilities. Citizenship is a good policy field for developing synergies between the current funding programmes for education, culture and EU citizenship. Stronger synergies between the Europe for Citizens programme and the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme could be achieved through closer thematic cooperation, for example in the area of anti-racism, equality, cultural heritage, remembrance and cultural diversity. Remembrance activities, town-twinning or pan-European networks are intended to broaden perspectives and develop a sense of European belonging and European identity. \uf0b7 Consistency with other Union policies The Justice, Rights and Values fund and its two underlying funding programmes will help to strengthen and uphold EU values and the respect of the rule of law and to sustain the open, democratic, inclusive and creative societies which Europeans expect. Already under current rules, Member States are required to show that their rules and procedures for financial management of EU money are robust and funding is sufficiently protected from abuse or fraud.

        "EN 5 EN Member States can ultimately guarantee that money from the EU budget is sufficiently protected. On the basis of Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Commission has proposed a Regulation on the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The new Regulation will complement the instruments aiming at upholding EU common values, including this programme. The Rights and Values programme will fund policies dealing with values and rights and have at its core people \u2019 s lives and participation. In that respect, it will have close synergies with several policies and their funding programmes. The following synergies are worth highlighting: \u2013 Synergies with employment, social and education policies The future European Social Fund plus will be a major building block of the \u2018 Investing in People and Values \u2019 cluster. This building block will provide support to citizens by investing in: human capital, (youth) employment, social innovation, the acquisition of basic digital skills, the integration of migrants, the social inclusion of the most deprived, and a high level of human health protection. Potential synergies will be developed or strengthened, in particular to promote gender equality and equal opportunities for under-represented groups such as the Roma, and to promote social justice, EU values and the respect of fundamental rights. Synergies with the Erasmus+ programme can be strengthened, given that Erasmus+ also supports disadvantaged groups \u2014 such as youngsters with disabilities \u2014 gain better access to education, it supports actions that aim to achieve stronger social inclusion and it aims to promote common values through education. Already existing synergies with Creative Europe will be maintained and reinforced, in particular as regards cultural heritage and cultural diversity. \u2013 Synergies with external, development cooperation and enlargement policies The promotion of values and rights within the EU is mirrored by their promotion at the global level, including through the linkages with the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. In this respect, synergies need to be developed, in particular with the EU\u2019s external action at multilateral level but also in development cooperation aid and in enlargement policy, to ensure coherence in the promotion of human rights, the rule of law gender equality, anti- discrimination, tolerance.. \u2013 Synergies with the Single Market The future Single Market programme will provide support to citizens and consumers in the internal market, thus helping to enhance their rights and empower them. In this respect, it will complement the actions funded by the Rights and Values programme which has a strong focus on empowering people. By financing activities involving company law, contract law and anti-money laundering, the future Single Market programme will complement the Justice programme and contribute directly to the implementation of EU justice policy and the creation of an EU area of justice. The same is valid for consumer policy. \u2013 Synergies with migration, border management and security The Rights and Values programme will help to address the different challenges that are undermining social cohesion in the EU. This programme will support activities to combat and ",
        "EN 6 EN prevent racism, xenophobia, hate speech and violent extremism, thus also contributing to the fight against radicalisation and terrorism more broadly. By promoting and protecting the rights of the child in vulnerable situations (including migration), preventing violence against women and children and supporting actions combating discrimination, this programme also contributes to priorities and objectives related to the better management of migration, the promotion of inclusion and addressing trafficking in human beings. \u2013 Synergies with environmental policy The coverage of health-related matters in the Rights and Values Programme will complement the coverage of health-related matters under EU environmental policy, including measures with an environmental health dimension under the LIFE Regulation 3 . \u2013 Climate mainstreaming The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. The contribution of this programme to the achievement of this overall target will be tracked through an EU climate marker system at an appropriate level of disaggregation, including the use of more precise methodologies where these are available. The Commission will continue to present the information annually in terms of commitment appropriations in the context of the annual draft budget. To support the full utilisation of the potential of the programme to contribute to climate objectives, the Commission will seek to identify relevant actions throughout the programme preparation, implementation, review and evaluation processes. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \uf0b7 Legal basis The proposal is based on Articles 16(2), 19(2), 21(2), 24, 167(5) and 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The combination of these articles is necessary to continue supporting policies which are developed and implemented in the current programmes. It is not meant to extend activities to new policy areas. The combination of more than one Article is necessary to achieve the programme \u2019s general objectives in a comprehensive way and to adopt a simplified and more efficient approach to funding. Under Article 16(2) TFEU, the Union has the power to adopt measures relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and by Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Union law, and the rules relating to the free movement of such data. This Treaty provision is a legal basis for this proposal. Article 19(2) provides for the adoption of incentive measures to support Member State action in combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, including activities promoting equality between women and men and supporting the rights of the child. This Treaty provision is a legal basis for this proposal. 3 Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the establishment of a Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 614/2007 Text with EEA relevance ",
        "EN 7 EN Article 21(2) TFEU provides for Union measures to facilitate the exercise of citizens \u2019 rights to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. Actions to inform citizens and authorities about the rights to diplomatic and consular protection and about their voting rights can also be covered by this Article since in practice they facilitate the exercise of a citizen\u2019s right to move and reside freely. Democratic engagement, civic participation and the fostering of civil society are essential building blocks of the notion of EU citizenship and the right to move and reside freely in the EU as defined in Article 21(1). In this regard, they constitute crucial factors and facilitators of the right to move and reside freely in the EU. Article 24 TFEU provides for citizens' initiatives within the meaning of Article 11 TEU. The former is a legal basis for this proposal to the extent that it provides for the financing of the technical and organisational support to implement Regulation [(EU) No 211/2011], thereby underpinning the exercise by citizens of their right to launch and support European c itizens\u2019 initiatives. Article 167 TFEU tasks the Union to contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and by bringing forward the common cultural heritage. The actions by the Union shall encourage co-operation between Member States and supplement their actions in areas such as, inter alia, improvement of the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples and conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage of European significance. Article 167(5) TFEU is therefore a legal basis for this proposal. Article 168 TFEU provides for a high level of human health protection and Union action complementing national policies in preventing physical and mental illness and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. Violence, including against children and women, constitutes a danger to physical and mental health. Children are vulnerable citizens and need an increased level of protection against these dangers often include cross-border threats. Violence against women also constitutes a serious threat to the physical and mental health of victims, who are in need of a high level of protection. Article 168 TFEU is therefore a legal basis for this proposal. \uf0b7 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The promotion and protection of values requires transnational cooperation mechanisms and networking opportunities. Member States acting alone typically cannot achieve this. In many areas, such as equality and non-discrimination or citizenship, individuals are protected by Union law and legislation but are not sufficiently aware of their rights. Only by raising awareness, sharing best practices and providing training at EU level will it be possible to reach persons in all Member States, inform administrative structures/authorities and convey a consistent message. At the same time, acting at EU level produces economies of scale, ensures the quality of the actions and guarantees that Member States have a consistent interpretation and coherent application of legislative instruments throughout the EU. Funding at national or regional level for activities promoting EU citizen participation is very limited, and in many EU countries there is even less funding for remembrance activities. Even where beneficiaries receive funding for similar activities, alternative funding sources do not give priority to promoting citizenship and remembrance at EU level. Stakeholders\u2019 limited or inexistent ability to conduct similar projects without the support of EU funding highlights the level of reliance of beneficiaries on such funds. \uf0b7 Proportionality ",
        "EN 8 EN The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality, in that it does not go beyond the minimum required to achieve the stated objective at European level and what is necessary for that purpose. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \uf0b7 Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation The mid-term evaluation of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme shows that the problems and drivers underlying the programme\u2019s general objective and specific objectives are still relevant. The overall support needs identified at the start of the REC programme have not been fully met and continue to be relevant. Overall, the REC programme is appropriately addressing the relevant groups but a more systematic analysis of their needs should be carried out in the implementation. In addition, issues regarding equity (distribution of funds across the groups of beneficiaries, involvement of equality bodies, gender mainstreaming, mainstreaming of rights of the child and rights of people with disabilities) in programming, implementation and monitoring have also been identified. Also, a coordination and information exchange between EU programmes and projects would be instrumental to further their coherence. Progress in implementing the REC programme has been satisfactory in terms of financial implementation and the programme activities\u2019 outreach to participants. Analysis of what the REC programme has accomplished shows that the groups participating in the activities funded by the programme now have a better understanding of Union law and policies. Beneficiaries gave a largely positive assessment of the activities in which they participated although there is scope to improve this sustainability. The range of communication activities to promote the REC programme has been largely successful. However, efforts need to continue to ensure all potential applicants in all Member States are reached. A key achievement of the new programme, compared to prior programmes, has been the lower burden on beneficiaries in terms of time and money: beneficiaries surveyed report that both the preparation of the proposals and the implementation of the activities have become less burdensome. The types of implementing measures (operating grants, action grants, direct grants and procurement) are in line with the programme \u2019s objectives and with the needs of stakeholders eligible for support. The REC funding regulation provided great flexibility with the use of restricted calls, especially when it came to implementing large-scale awareness campaigns on data protection and the prevention of violence Beneficiaries of the programme raised concerns regarding the efficiency of the application process, implementation and reporting duties and mechanisms. Simplification is an area where room for improvement remains. The evaluations and studies of the Europe for Citizens programme these past 10 years have shown that the programme has played an important role as the only EU programme directly targeting citizens and involving them through a bottom-up approach. The mid-term evaluation of the Europe for Citizens 2014-2020 programme showed that its objectives were and remain relevant to the problems to be addressed, i.e. to contribute to citizens\u2019 understanding of the Union, its shared history and diversity, and to foster European citizenship and improve conditions for civic and democratic participation at Union level. These two strands are not only complementary but mutually supportive because of the connection between lessons learned from the past and plans made for the future of Europe. The high number of direct and indirect participants that Europe for Citizens has reached illustrates that the programme has been effective at a relatively low cost. At the same time, the high demand from grant applicants shows that there is scope for additional funding, and this was requested by ",
        "EN 9 EN stakeholders consulted during the evaluation. In its March 2017 report on the implementation of the Europe for Citizens 2014-2020 programme, the European Parliament expressed its strong support for the programme and called for a substantial budgetary increase. Europe for Citizens has demonstrated its added value at EU level thanks to its impact on participants and its role as a complement to other EU funding programmes and policy initiatives on education, culture and EU citizenship. Aspects that have been identified for improvement include in particular increasing the programme \u2019 s visibility, revising the monitoring indicators and developing stronger synergies with other relevant EU funding programmes and initiatives. \uf0b7 Stakeholder consultations The consultation strategy supporting this preparatory work for the programme included: (i) a public consultation on values and mobility and on the proposal for the post-2020 multiannual financial framework; (ii) public consultations for the mid-term evaluation of the current funding programmes; and (iii) several ad hoc consultations that the Commission organised in the form of roundtable discussions with stakeholders, conferences and seminars. T HE OPEN PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU FUNDS IN THE AREA OF VALUES AND MOBILITY Consultations have taken place in the context of evaluations of existing EU financial programmes covering several policy areas and notably looked at current performance and future challenges. The purpose of the public consultation on EU funds in the area of values and mobility was to collect the views of all interested parties on how to make the most of every euro of the EU budget. The public consultation on EU funds in the area of values and mobility was open from 10 January 2018 to 9 March 2018 in 23 official EU languages. In response to the online public consultation on EU funds in the area of values and mobility, the Commission received a total of 1 839 replies from all over Europe . Of these, 52% were from respondents with experience of Erasmus+ and 43% were from respondents with experience of the Creative Europe programme. There was at least one response from each Member State, The country of residence with the most contributions overall was Germany (24.4%), followed by France (8.7%), Belgium (7.7%) and Spain (5.4%). Of the 1 839 contributions received via the online questionnaire, 65.2 % (1 199) were from organisations and 34.8 % (640) from individuals . A wide range of stakeholders shared their opinions: of the 1 199 contributions from organisations, 355 (19.3%) were from non-governmental organisations , platforms or networks, 270 ( 14.7%) from private enterprises (mainly micro and small businesses) and 127 (6.9%) from researchers and academics . The analysis summed up below focuses on the respondents with experience of the following EU programmes: 1. Europe for Citizens programme and/or 2. Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme and/or 3. Creative Europe programme and/or 4. Justice programme. Below are some of the main results: \u2013 According to the respondents, \u2018 Promoting European identity and common values \u2019 and \u2018 promoting rights and equality \u2019 are important common policy challenges (among the first four challenges mentioned) to be addressed in each of the four ",
        "EN 10 EN programmes. \u2018 Supporting active citizenship, democratic participation in society and the rule of law \u2019 and \u2018 Promoting social inclusion and fairness \u2019 also appear to be important challenges to be addressed in the relevant programmes but to a lesser extent in the Creative Europe programme, for which economic challenges and cultural diversity are more important. \u2013 \u2018 Supporting innovation \u2019 , \u2018 Fostering European cultural diversity and cultural heritage \u2019 , \u2018 Promoting European identity and common values \u2019 are considered policies that address fully or fairly well the challenges faced by half or more of the respondents with experience of the four programmes concerned. Also, 52 % of the respondents with experience of the Creative Europe programme consider that the policy to \u2018 Support competitiveness of European cultural and creative sectors \u2019 addresses the challenges fully or fairly well. \u2013 Around 80 % of the respondents with experience of the four EU programmes mentioned above agree that these programmes add value to a large extent or to a fairly good extent to what Member States could achieve at national, regional and/or local level. \u2013 The main obstacles identified by the respondents that could prevent the current programmes/funds from achieving their objectives are very similar regardless of the programme concerned: \u2018 Lack of budget of the programmes to satisfy demand \u2019 ; \u2018 Insufficient support provided to small-scale stakeholders \u2019 ; \u2018 Lack of support to first-time applicants \u2019 are identified as the main three obstacles. \u2013 Respondents with experience of one or more of the four EU programmes agree that \u2018 the use of more simplified application forms \u2019 , \u2018 facilitating structured network and partnerships \u2019 , \u2018 facilitating funding for actions cutting across the sectors of action \u2019 and \u2018 better coordination between different programmes/funds \u2019 are the main steps to be taken to simplify and reduce the administrative burden for beneficiaries. Impact assessment The impact assessment was prepared to analyse a possible European Culture, Rights and Values programme merging the 2014-2020 Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Europe for Citizens programme and the Creative Europe programme \u2014 and the Justice programme. The Commission decided to have a self-standing Creative Europe programme and to create a Justice, Rights and Values Fund with two underlying funding programmes: the Justice programme and the Rights and Values programme. The impact assessment remains valid in underpinning all these initiatives. On 20 April 2018, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board gave a positive opinion on the accompanying impact assessment. The Board included a recommendation to further improve the report, some key aspects of this being full exploitation of the evaluation results and findings outcomes, a better design of the future priorities and clarification of the expected impacts of the changes in delivery mechanisms. These aspects were strengthened in the final version of the impact assessment. The impact assessment compiled the lessons learned from the Creative Europe programme, the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Europe for Citizens programme and the Justice programme and proposed a new structure. It also explored delivery mechanisms that will promote EU values and culture while achieving the objectives of efficiency, flexibility, synergies and simplification set for the next multiannual financial framework. The results of the mid-term evaluation have been duly taken into account. All the programmes evaluated have shown clear added value. With the new ",
        "EN 11 EN clustering, it will be possible to further exploit the potential of current programmes to promote EU values and increase EU added value. Three main scenarios were analysed: \u2013 The status quo of maintaining four funding programmes under the \u2018v alues \u2019 sub-cluster of the EU budget, namely the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, the Justice programme, the Creative Europe programme and the Europe for Citizens programme. \u2013 As an alternative to the current situation and baseline scenario, the second scenario proposed developing synergies among the current programmes and combining them to form a single political chapeau on EU values with two underlying funding programmes: the European Culture, Rights and Values programme and the Justice programme. \u2013 A third scenario involved the creation of one single funding programme covering all four funding programmes listed above. The baseline scenario: the status quo with four funding programmes and a proportional 15 % budgetary cut Analysis of the baseline scenario with a possible 15 % cut in the available funding shows that there would be negative consequences for policy implementation. In particular: A 15 % reduction in funding for the REC programme would result in an annual prioritisation, i.e. concentration of funding in some policy areas in one year and promotion of other policy areas in the following years, in contradiction with the increasing needs in the field. This reduction would also mean cutting back on studies, data collection, awareness-raising campaigns etc., all necessary to have sound, evidence-based policy and legislation. For the Europe for Citizens programme , a budgetary cut of 15 % would reduce the baseline budget to \u20ac157 million, which is insufficient for the Commission \u2019 s commitment to put citizens at the centre of the European process. The critical mass of participants and the geographical coverage of activities necessary to achieve the intended impact would no longer be reached. A stable budgetary allocation (based on the 2017 budget) would allow continuity but still have limited impact. A decrease of 15 % in funding for the MEDIA sub-programme of Creative Europe would inevitably mean streamlining and concentrating on a limited number of actions. A reduction in funding would disproportionately impact lower production countries and/or countries with a restricted geographic/linguistic area. It would also reduce the number of training activities for audiovisual professionals and the number of EU co-productions, which are works that travel better across borders. Reducing the scope of the network of cinema operators would negatively impact the access of EU citizens, notably from Central and Eastern European countries, to non-national European content. A decrease of 15 % for the Culture sub-programme of Creative Europe would not make it possible to reach a critical mass to respond to the needs of the cultural and creative sectors. This would imply in particular less European added value and therefore a reduced impact on cultural diversity, fewer opportunities for cross-border cooperation, fewer market opportunities and fewer career possibilities for practitioners from the cultural and creative sectors. The societal impact would be reduced, and the international opening of the programme might need to be limited to its pre-2014 level and the participation of key EU neighbouring partner countries abandoned. ",
        "EN 12 EN The Financial Guarantee for the cultural and creative sectors could be put at risk, which would be detrimental to the cultural and creative sectors, especially for eastern countries whose financial markets are less developed and where therefore there are therefore fewer possibilities to access to finance. Discarded alternative in the impact assessment: one programme For reasons related to the legal basis, the alternative proposed in the third scenario of a single instrument/programme has been discarded. Indeed, most of the activities and policies are based on articles that provide for an ordinary legislative procedure except for the current Europe for Citizens programme. Currently, the main focus of the Europe for Citizens programme is on civic participation and is therefore based on Article 352 TFEU (unanimity). After analysis, the objectives of the corresponding activities could, if their focus was modified to a certain degree, be adapted to fit with the new approach of a broader programme; in such case, they would fall within the scope of Article 167(1) and (2) TFEU, which provides for the ordinary legislative procedure. However, given the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland on the area of freedom, security and justice and the position of Denmark as laid down in Protocols 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaties, the Justice programme, while also commanding the ordinary legislative procedure, needs to remain a separate instrument. Proposed alternative in the impact assessment: an EU Values framework with two funding programmes The analysis shows that there is room for improvement in relation to the current situation of four funding programmes. Therefore, as an alternative to the current situation and baseline scenario, it is proposed that synergies be developed among the current programmes and prerogative lines and combined into a single political chapeau on EU values with two underlying funding programmes: the European Culture, Rights and Values programme and the Justice programme, as presented below: The new architecture of the future funding as an alternative to the baseline scenario aims at: \u2013 developing synergies among policies, finding a common ground for action, while respecting their specific features; \u2013 reducing overlap and fragmentation; \u2013 ensuring flexibility in the allocation of funds, while ensuring a certain degree of predictability of funding dedicated to each policy; \u2013 fostering cross-sectoral and innovative actions; \u2013 ensuring a critical mass of resources to promote values, taking also into account the needs of each policy. Retained alternative The Commission decided to have a self-standing Creative Europe programme and to create a Justice, Rights and Values Fund including two programmes: the Justice programme and the Rights and Values programme. The impact assessment remains valid in underpinning these initiatives. This decision is reflected in the post-2020 MFF proposal package that the Commission presented on 02 May 2018 4 . \uf0b7 Simplification The proposed Rights and Values programme is the result of grouping together two funding programmes, namely the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme and the Europe for 4 COM(2018)321. ",
        "EN 13 EN Citizens programme. These programmes are small instruments, which cannot reach a critical mass and whose effectiveness is constrained by their relatively low budgets. Therefore, bringing them together will mean simplification, synergies and mutual reinforcement and will help to make them more effective. In particular, by re-grouping citizenship activities under the same objectives, the procedures will be easier for beneficiaries who will have a single entry point for their proposals. The current Europe for Citizens programme has already undergone substantial simplification with measures such as lump sums and flat rates, e-form applications and grant decisions. Along these lines, simplified implementation will be sought for the policy areas funded by the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme with measures such as lump sums, flat rates and unit costs. The complexity and diversity of the funding rules of the current programmes represent an obstacle for applicants. Providing a single entry point for external users to participate in the grants life cycle (i.e. a participant portal), which includes a comprehensive system to manage grants, can play an important role in simplifying access to the programme. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme is managed through the Commission corporate system initially developed for the Horizon 2020 programme, whereas the Europe for Citizens programme may follow at a later stage. Once this migration finalised, the Rights and Values programme and its beneficiaries will benefit from this simplification. \uf0b7 Fundamental rights The objectives of the Rights and Values programme are closely linked to the promotion of fundamental rights and are in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. In particular, the new programme, together with the Justice programme, will be part of a Justice, Rights and Values Fund of the EU budget aimed at to sustaining open, democratic, and inclusive societies, empowering people by protecting and promoting rights and values and developing further an EU area of justice. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The financial allocation for implementing the Rights and Values programme from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027 will amount to EUR [641 705 000] (current prices). 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \uf0b7 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements An implementation plan will be developed to specify the arrangements for the running of the programme. A monitoring and evaluation plan will be developed to specify how actions are to be carried out in practice, and under what data strategy. The programme will be monitored be both continuous (e.g. to respond in a timely manner to unforeseen events and exceptional needs) and on a regular basis (to report on key events such as calls for proposals, project reviews, coordination or dissemination events) and, where relevant, the monitoring will feed into the key programme indicators. The monitoring reports will subsequently feed into: \u2013 a mid-term evaluation (no later than four years after the start of programme implementation), combined with the final evaluation of the predecessor programmes; and ",
        "EN 14 EN \u2013 a final evaluation (to be performed no later than four years after the end of the programming period). These evaluations will be carried out in line with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 5 , where the three institutions confirmed that evaluations of existing legislation and policy should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action. The evaluations will assess the programme \u2019 s effects on the ground, using the programme indicators/targets and analysing in detail the degree to which the programme can be deemed relevant, effective and efficient, provides enough EU added value and is coherent with other EU policies. The evaluations will include lessons learnt to address any shortcomings/problems identified and recommendations to take advantage of any potential to further improve the actions or their results and maximise their use/impact. The Commission will report to the European Parliament, Council and all other relevant EU institutions regularly, through monitoring and evaluation reports and a public scoreboard of the key programme indicators. A significant part of the programme will be implemented by the Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture (EACEA) under the supervision of the Commission services responsible for the programme. \uf0b7 Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal The general objective of the proposed Rights and Values programme is \u2018 to protect and promote rights and values as enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by supporting civil society organisations, in order to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies\". This general objective will be achieved through three specific objectives: to promote equality and rights, to promote citizen engagement and participation in the democratic life of the Union, and to fight all forms of violence. The programme will provide for and accelerate the synergies between its different specific objectives to more effectively support the policy areas these objectives cover and increase their potential to reach people. To be effective, the programme should take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. 5 Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016; OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1 \u2013 14.

These values are common to the Member States in a society where pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail\u2019. Article 3 further specifies that the \u2018Union\u2019s ai m is to promote peace, its values and the well- being of its people\u2019 and, among others, \u2018it shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe\u2019s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced\u2019. Those values are further rea ffirmed and articulated in the rights, freedoms and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. (2) Those rights and values must continue to be promoted and enforced and shared among the citizens and peoples and be at the heart of the EU project. Therefore , a new Justice, Rights and Values Fund, comprising the Rights and Values and the Justice programmes shall be created in the EU budget. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values: human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. This will have profound and direct implications for political, social, cultural and economic life in the EU. As part of the new Fund, the Justice Programme will continue to support the further development of Union area of justice and cross-border cooperation. The Rights and Values Programme will bring together the 2014-2020 Programme Rights, Equality and Citizenship established by Regulation (EU) No 1381/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 6 OJ C [\u2026] , [\u2026] , p.

        "EN 16 EN and the Europe for Citizens programme established by Council Regulation (EU) No 390/2014 9 , (hereafter 'the predecessor Programmes'). (3) The Justice, Rights and Values Fund and its two underlying funding programmes will focus primarily on people and entities, which contribute to make our common values, rights and rich diversity alive and vibrant. The ultimate objective is to nurture and sustain rights-based, equal, inclusive and democratic society. That includes a vibrant civil society, encouraging people's democratic, civic and social participation and fostering the rich diversity of European society, based on our common history and memory. Article 11 of the Treaty of the European Union further specifies that the institutions shall, by appropriate means, give citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known and publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action. (4) The Rights and Values programme (the 'Programme') should allow developing synergies to tackle the challenges that are common to the promotion and protection of values and to reach a critical dimension to have concrete results in the field. That should be achieved by building on the positive experience of the predecessor Programmes. This will enable to fully exploit the potential of synergies, to more effectively support the policy areas covered and to increase their potential to reach people. To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. (5) In order to bring the European Union closer to its citizens, a variety of actions and coordinated efforts are necessary. Bringing together citizens in town-twinning projects or networks of towns and supporting civil society organisations in the areas covered by the programme will contribute to increase citizens' engagement in society and ultimately their involvement in the democratic life of the Union. At the same time supporting activities promoting mutual understanding, diversity, dialogue and respect for others fosters a sense of belonging and a European identity, based on a shared understanding of European values, culture, history and heritage. The promotion of a greater sense of belonging to the Union and of Union values is particularly important amongst citizens of the EU outermost regions due to their remoteness and distance from continental Europe. (6) Remembrance activities and critical reflection on Europe\u2019s historical memory are necessary to make citizens aware of the common history, as the foundation for a common future, moral purpose and shared values. The relevance of historical, cultural and intercultural aspects should also be taken into account, as well as the links between remembrance and the creation of a European identity and sense of belonging together. (7) Citizens should also be more aware of their rights deriving from citizenship of the Union, and should feel at ease about living, travelling, studying, working and volunteering in another Member State, and should feel able to enjoy and exercise all their citizenship rights, place their trust in equal access, full enforceability and protection of their rights without any discrimination, no matter where in the Union they happen to be. Civil society needs to be supported for the promotion, safeguarding and raising awareness of EU common values under Article 2 TEU and in contributing to the effective enjoyment of rights under Union law. 9 Council Regulation (EU) No 390/2014 of 14 April 2014 establishing the \u2018Europe for Citizens\u2019 programme for the period 2014-2020 (OJ L 115, 17.4.2014, p.3) ",
        "EN 17 EN (8) Equality between women and men is a fundamental value and an objective of the European Union. Discrimination against and unequal treatment of women violates their fundamental rights and prevents their full political, social and economic participation in society. In addition, the existence of structural and cultural barriers hinders the achievement of real gender equality. Promoting gender equality in all activities of the Union is therefore a core activity for the Union and a driver for economic growth and should be supported by the programme. (9) Gender-based violence and violence against children and young people constitute a serious violation of fundamental rights. Violence persists throughout the Union, in all social and economic contexts, and has serious repercussions on victims \u2019 physical and psychological health and on society as a whole. Children, young people and women are particularly vulnerable to violence, in particular in close relationships. Action should be taken to promote the rights of the child and to contribute to the protection of children from harm and violence, which pose a danger to their physical and mental health and constitute a breach of their rights to development, protection and dignity. Combating all forms of violence, promoting prevention and protecting and supporting victims are priorities of the Union which help fulfil individuals \u2019 fundamental rights and contribute to equality between women and men. Those priorities should be supported by the Programme. (10) Strong political will and coordinated action based on the methods and results of the previous Daphne Programmes, the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme and the Justice Programme are necessary in order to prevent and combat all forms of violence and to protect victims. In particular, since its launch in 1997, the Daphne funding to support victims of violence and combat the violence against women, children and young people has been a genuine success, both in terms of its popularity with stakeholders (public authorities, academic institutions and non-governmental organisations) and in terms of the effectiveness of the funded projects. It has funded projects to raise awareness, to provide support services to victims, to support the activities of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working on the ground. It has addressed all forms of violence, such as for instance domestic violence, sexual violence, trafficking in human beings, as well as new emerging forms of violence such as cyber-bullying. It is therefore important to continue all these actions and that those results and lessons learned are taken into due consideration in the implementation of the Programme. (11) Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of the Union. Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Non-discrimination is also enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter. The specific features of the diverse forms of discrimination should be taken into account and appropriate action should be developed in parallel to prevent and combat discrimination on one or more grounds. The Programme should support actions to prevent and combat discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism, anti-muslim hatred and other forms of intolerance. In that context, particular attention should also be devoted to preventing and combating all forms of violence, hatred, segregation and stigmatisation, as well as combating bullying, harassment and intolerant treatment. The Programme should be implemented in a mutually reinforcing manner with other Union activities that have the same objectives, in particular with those referred to in the Commission Communication of 5 April 2011 entitled \u2018 An EU Framework for ",

(12) Attitudinal and environmental barriers as well as lack of accessibility hinder the full and effective participation of people with disabilities in society, on an equal basis with others. People with disabilities are faced with barriers to, among other things, access the labour market, benefit from an inclusive and quality education, avoid poverty and social exclusion, enjoy access to cultural initiatives and media, or use their political rights. As a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the UNCRPD), the Union and all its Member States have committed to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. The provisions of the UNCRPD have become an integral part of the Union legal order. (13) The right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications (right to privacy) is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The protection of personal data is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data is subject to the control by independent supervisory authorities. The Unions\u2019 legal framework, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council 13 lay down provisions to ensure that the right to protection of personal data is effectively protected. These legal instruments entrust the national data protection supervisory authorities with the task of promoting public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data. The Union should be able to conduct awareness-raising activities, carry out studies and other relevant activities given the importance of the right to the protection of personal data in times of rapid technological developments. (14) Article 24 TFEU obliges the European Parliament and the Council to adopt provisions for the procedures and conditions required for a citizen's initiative within the meaning of Article 11 of the Treaty on European Union. This has been done by adopting Regulation [(EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 14 ]. The Programme should support the financing of technical and organisational support to implement Regulation [(EU) No 211/2011], thereby underpinning the exercise by citizens of the right to launch and support European c itizens\u2019 initiatives. (15) Pursuant to Articles 8 and 10 TFEU, the Programme in all its activities should support gender mainstreaming and the mainstreaming of non-discrimination objectives. (16) Article 3(3) TEU requires the Union to promote the protection of the rights of the child, in line with Article 24 of the Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. (17) In accordance with Union acts on equal treatment, Member States set up independent bodies for the promotion of equal treatment, commonly known as \"equality bodies\", in 10 COM(2011)173. 11 OJ C 378, 24.12.2013, p. 1. 12 OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1-88. 13 OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 89-131. 14 Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on the citizens\u2019 initiative (OJ L 65, 11.3.2011, p. 1).

However, many Member States have gone beyond these requirements and ensured that equality bodies can also deal with discrimination based on the other grounds such as age, sexual orientation, religion and belief, disability or other grounds. Equality bodies play a key role in promoting equality and ensuring effective application of equal treatment legislation by providing in particular an independent assistance to victims of discrimination, conducting independent surveys concerning discrimination, publishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to discrimination in their country. It is essential that the work of equality bodies is coordinated at Union level in this respect. EQUINET was created in 2007. Its members are the national bodies for the promotion of equal treatment as established by Council Directives 2000/43/EC 15 and 2004/113/EC 16 , and by Directives 2006/54/EC 17 and 2010/41/EU 18 of the European Parliament and of the Council. EQUINET is in an exceptional situation, being the only entity which ensures coordination of activities between equality bodies. This coordination activity by EQUINET is key for the good implementation of Union anti-discrimination law in Member States and should be supported by the Programme. (18) Independent human rights bodies and civil society organisations play an essential role in promoting, safeguarding and raising awareness of the Union\u2019s common values under Article 2 TEU, and in contributing to the effective enjoyment of rights under Union law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. As reflected in the European Parliament Resolution of 18 April 2018, adequate financial support is key to the development of a conducive and sustainable environment for civil society organisations to strengthen their role and perform their functions independently and effectively. Complementing efforts at national level, EU funding should therefore contribute to support, empower and build the capacity of independent civil society organisations active in the promotion of human rights whose activities help the strategic enforcement of rights under EU law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, including through advocacy and watchdog activities, as well as to promote, safegu ard and raise awareness of the Union\u2019s common values at national level. (19) The Commission should ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with the work of Union bodies, offices and agencies, in particular the European Institute for Gender Equality and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, and should take stock of the work of other national and international actors in the areas covered by the Programme.

In this context, funding has an important role to play. In particular, funding should enhance the awareness of values, effectiveness of legislation and rights enshrined directly in the Treaty by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of citizens, professionals and stakeholders, through supporting: - Information and public awareness raising, including through support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights, as guaranteed under EU law, and how to enforce them in practice, and thorugh remembrance activities; - Training and capacity building for legal professionals (such as judges and prosecutors) and other practitioners, to equip them with the tools to effectively put EU rights and policies into practice. Funding also has a central role in promoting cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through: - Strengthening networks and civil society, i.e. EU-wide organisations to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in this area, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe; - Cross-border cooperation on enforcement, for example establishing missing child alert systems, coordination of operational and cross-border anti-drug co- operation.

The results of these activities feed into the development and the implementation of EU policies and ensure that they are evidence-based, well targeted and well structured. All these activities will be implemented over the whole period 2021-2027. It is difficult to set a precise roll-out at this stage, considering the speed of new political challenges we have to face and react to. 1.4.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. Reasons for action at European level (ex-ante) Funding covered by the Rights and Values Programme concentrates on activities where the EU intervention can bring additional value compared to action of Member States alone. Activities covered by this Regulation contribute to the effective application of the acquis by developing mutual trust between Member States, increasing cross-border cooperation and networking and achieving correct, coherent and consistent application of Union law across the Union. Only action at Union level can provide coordinated activities that can reach all Member States. The European Union is in a better position than Member States to address cross-border situations and to provide a European platform for mutual learning. Without Union support, stakeholders would tend to address similar problems in a fragmented and disconnected way. The promotion and protection of values requires transnational cooperation mechanisms and networking opportunities which can typically not be achieved by Member States acting alone. In many areas, such as equality and non-discrimination or citizenship, individuals are protected by Union law and legislation, but are not sufficiently aware about their rights. Only awareness-raising actions, the sharing of best practices and training at EU level can ensure that persons in all Member States are reached, that administrative structures/authorities are informed and that a consistent message is passed on, whilst producing economies of scale, ensuring the quality of the actions and that Member States have a consistent interpretation and coherent application of legislative instruments throughout the EU. Funding at national or regional level for activities to foster citizens' participation as EU citizens is very limited, while funding for remembrance activities is even less available in many EU countries. Even where beneficiaries receive funding for similar activities, alternative funding sources do not prioritise the promotion of citizenship and remembrance at an EU level. Stakeholders\u2019 limited or inexistent ability to conduct similar projects without the support of EU funding highlights the level of reliance of beneficiaries on those. Expected generated Union added value (ex-post) Collaboration and networking between stakeholders will lead to the dissemination of best practices, in particular innovative and integrated approaches in different Member States. The participants in these activities will then act as multipliers in their ",

A sound analytical basis for the support and the development of policies will be supported. European Union intervention allows for these activities to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies of scale.] 1.4.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past The mid-term evaluations carried out for the current programme in the area of rights, equality and citizenship has confirmed the overall effectiveness of the programmes, but some aspects have been identified for improvement, in particular the need to focus more on emerging needs, the revision of the monitoring indicators, the achievement of a more geographic balance among the beneficiaries, the increase of the programme's visibility and the strengthening of synergies with other relevant EU funding programmes and initiatives. The mid-term evaluation report of the 2014-2020 Europe for Citizens programme confirmed that the general objectives are relevant to the current needs in the EU to encourage civic participation and awareness of the EU values, history and diversity. Europe for Citizens has demonstrated its added value both in terms of its impact on participants and its complementary role to other EU funding programmes and policy initiatives in the fields of education, culture and EU citizenship. Action and operating grants have been implemented in an efficient way. Aspects which have been identified for improvement mostly relate to increasing the programme's visibility, amending the monitoring indicators and strengthening the synergies with other relevant EU funding programmes and initiatives. 1.4.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments The Programme will seek synergies, consistency and complementarities with other Union instruments, inter alia the Single Market Programme as it provides support to empower consumers and strengthen the work of enforcement authorities in the consumer area; the European Social Fund+ with its strong and direct impact on people \u2013 including the most disadvantaged and discriminated against \u2013 and its significance for promoting gender equality and equal opportunities, EU values and the respect of fundamental rights. The promotion of values and rights within the EU is mirrored by their promotion at the global level, including through the linkages of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. In this respect, synergies can also be developed with external action at multilateral level.

Furthermore, an interim evaluation report on the achievement of the Programme\u2019s objectives, the efficiency of the use of resources and its European added value will be provided by the Commission by mid-2025 at the latest, combined with the lessons learned from the predecessor programmes.

Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed For Specific objectives \"Rights and Equality\" & \"Daphne\" managed by DG JUST and EMPL The implementation of actions foreseen in the programme under the strand \"equality and rights \" and \"Daphne\" will be done through direct management, contributing to the common policy objectives of the Union. This part of the programme will be managed directly by the Commission using the implementation modes offered by the Financial Regulation, mainly grants and procurement, as this allows to better adapt the programmes to the needs of the policy and to have more flexibility to re-adjust priorities in case of emerging needs. Direct management by the Commission will also allow to establish direct contacts with beneficiaries/contractors directly engaged in activities that serve Union policies. The interim evaluation of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme 2014- 2020 concluded that there is no clear scope for further simplifications concerning the management mode of the Programme. The current direct management mode is adequate given the size of the Programme. The strand of the programme focussing on persons with disabilities will be implemented through direct management, using the implementation modes offered by the Financial Regulation, mainly being grants and procurement. Direct management allows to establish direct contacts with beneficiaries/contractors directly engaged in activities that serve Union policies. The Commission ensures direct monitoring over the outcome of the actions financed. The payment modalities of the actions funded will be adapted to the risks pertaining to the financial transactions. In order to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the Commission controls, the strategy will be oriented towards a balance of ex-ante and ex-post checks. Ex-post audits will be carried out on-the-spot by external auditors for a sample of transactions. The selection of these transactions will combine a risk assessment and a random selection. ",
        "EN 36 EN Ex-Post controls also rely on cross-reliance for audits and sharing available information to further reduce administrative burden and increase cost-effectiveness (Art 127 & 128 new FR) For specific objective \"Citizens engagement and participation\" managed by DG HOME The implementation of the actions foreseen under the strand \"Citizens' engagement and participation\" could be entrusted to an Executive Agency 30 . Indeed, most of the actions under the current Europe for Citizens programme are managed by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). The 3rd evaluation of the EACEA covering the period January 2012 \u2013 December 2014 showed that the mandate of the EACEA was relevant to the needs of the Commission and the Agency's applicants / beneficiaries. It should be also underlined that the simplification measures put in place for the actions under the current Europe for Citizens programme significantly reduced error rates and allow fast contracting/paying. The programme will be implemented through calls for proposals and grants as under the current \"Europe for Citizens\" programme. As regards payment modalities, one prefinancing instalment and payment of the balance after final report are foreseen. Use of lump sums / flat rates will reduce the risks of errors. 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them For Specific objectives \"Rights and Equality\" & \"Daphne\" managed by DG JUST and EMPL The main risks linked to DG JUST financing activities are twofold: - the risk of not financing the best project to adress the issue identified - the risks of irregularity and illegality of the costs claimed and reimbursed. As regards the legality and regularity risk, based on the main causes and types of most commonly detected errors in ex-post audits, it appears that the main areas of irregularities stem from poor financial management by the beneficiaries, mainly due to a poor understanding of the rules due to their complexity in particular for the eligibility of the costs.. Consequently the risks are mainly due to \u2013 ensuring quality of selected projects and their subsequent technical implementation; \u2013 Risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded, both for grants (complexity of reimbursing actual eligible costs) and for procurement (sometimes limited number of economic providers with the required specialist knowledge entailing insufficient possibilities to compare price offers); \u2013 Fraud Most of these risks are expected to be reduced thanks to: 30 The decision to delegate implementation tasks to an Executive Agency will be taken according to COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 58/2003, based on a cost benefit analysis.

The control strategy will be based on the new Financial Regulation and on the Common Provision Regulation. The new Financial Regulation and the draft proposal for the Justice programme should extend the use of the simplified forms of grants such as lump-sums, flat rates and unit costs. The control strategy is composed of different building blocks: - programming, evaluation and selection of proposals in order to ensure that only the best proposals are funded; - Conclusion and monitoring of the grant agreements: All transactions and procedures are subject to an ex ante verification by the Programme and financial management Unit of DG JUST, as well as the relevant policy units. The financial verification is done by the Programme and financial management Unit. For grants, cost claims are verified thoroughly, and supporting documents are requested when deemed necessary, based on a risk assessment. - ex post audits assured via a Service Level Agreement with DG HOME: The ex-post control sector applies a \"detection strategy\" aimed at detecting a maximum of anomalies in view of recovering undue payments. Based on this strategy, the audits are carried out on a sample of projects selected almost entirely on the basis of a risk analysis. The cost of controls amounts to approximately 4,49% of the payments done by DG JUST. This is expected to stay stable or slightly decrease in the case where the use of simplified cost options (SCO) will be broadened in the next programming period. The implementation focuses on the attribution of public procurement contracts while a number of grants for specific activities and organisations are foreseen. The public procurement contracts will mainly be concluded in areas such as studies, data collection, evaluation contracts, training, information campaigns, IT and communication services, facilities management etc. The contractors are mainly consultancy firms and other private companies of which many SMEs. Grants will mainly be awarded for support activities to non-governmental organisations, national authorities etc. The period of execution of the subsidised projects and activities varies from one to three years mostly. The main risks are the following: \u2022 Risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded both for grants (complexity of funding rules, especially for small operators) and for procurement (limited number of economic providers with the required specialist knowledge entailing insufficient possibilities to compare price offers in some sectors); ",
        "EN 38 EN \u2022 Reputational risk for the Commission, if fraud or criminal activities are discovered; only partial assurance can be drawn from the third parties' internal control systems due to the rather large number of heterogeneous contractors and beneficiaries, each operating their own control system, often rather small in size. The Commission put in place internal procedures that aim at covering the risks identified above. The internal procedures are in full compliance with the Financial Regulation and include anti-fraud measures and cost-benefit considerations. Within this framework, the Commission continues to explore possibilities to enhance the management and to realise efficiency gains. Main features of the control framework are the following: Controls before and during the implementation of the projects: \u2022 Model grant agreements and service contracts are being used, developed within the Commission. They provide for a number of control provisions such as audit certificates, financial guarantees, on-site audits as well as inspections by OLAF. The rules governing the eligibility of costs are being simplified, for example, by using unit costs, lump sums, contributions not linked to costs and other possibilities offered by the Financial Regulation. This will reduce the cost of controls and put the focus on checks and controls in high-risk areas. \u2022 All staff sign up to the code of good administrative behaviour. Staff who are involved in the selection procedure or in the management of the grant agreements/contracts (also) sign a declaration of absence of a conflict of interest. Staff is regularly trained and uses networks to exchange best practices. \u2022 Technical implementation of a project is checked at regular intervals at the desk on the basis of technical progress reports of the contractors and beneficiaries; in addition, contractors'/beneficiaries' meetings and on-site-visits are foreseen on a case-by-case basis. Controls at the end of the project: Ex-post audits are performed to verify on-the-spot the eligibility of cost claims. The aim of these controls is to prevent, detect and correct material errors related to the legality and regularity of financial transactions. With a view to achieving a high control impact, the selection of beneficiaries to be audited foresees to combine a risk- based selection with a random sampling, and to pay attention to operational aspects whenever possible during the on-site audit. For specific objective \"Citizens engagement and participation\" managed by DG HOME A: Key risks and key causes of errors The current Europe for Citizens programme is managed by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). Thanks to the simplification measures put in place (in particular lump sums), the current \"Europe for Citizens\" is implemented with an estimated error rate well below the materiality threshold of 2 %. These simplification measures shall continue to be implemented under the future programme. B: Information on the internal control system set up within the Commission \u2013 Supervision of the EACEA by the Commission ",
        "EN 39 EN The Commission will apply the control measures required for executive agencies in accordance with Article 62 of the Financial Regulation [in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 58/2003 Regulation on executive agencies]. In addition, the Commission will monitor and control that the executive agency realises appropriate control objectives for the actions that it will be entrusted to manage. This supervision will be integrated in the terms of cooperation between the parent DG and the executive agency and in the biannual reporting of the agency. C: Information on the internal control system set up within the EACEA The control system is implemented by the EACEA 2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of \"control costs \u00f7 value of the related funds managed\"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) For Specific objectives \"Rights and Equality\" & \"Daphne\" managed by DG JUST and EMPL. The cost of controls amounts to approximately 4,49% of the payments done by DG JUST. This is expected to stay stable or slightly decrease in the case where the use of simplified cost options (SCO) will be broadened in the next programming period. It would not be cost effective to increase the cost of control for a marginal improvement of the error rate. In DG EMPL, the cost of the suggested level of controls represents approximately 4% of the yearly budget of the operational expenditure. This is justified by the high amount of transactions to be controlled. Indeed, in the area of persons with disabilities, direct management involves the attribution of numerous contracts and grants for actions, and the payment of numerous operating grants to non- governmental organisations. The risk related to these activities concerns the capacity of (especially) smaller organisations to effectively control expenditure. On a 5 years basis, the error rate for the on-the-spot audits of grants under direct management was 1.8%. For the whole of DG EMPL programmes and globally taking into account the low risk level for procurement below 1 %. This level of error is considered acceptable, as it is under the materiality level of 2%. The proposed changes for the programme will not affect the way the appropriations are currently managed. The existing control system proved to be able to prevent and/or to detect errors and/or irregularities, and in case of errors or irregularities, to correct them. Therefore, historical error rates are expected to remain at the same levels. For specific objective \"Citizens engagement and participation\" managed by DG HOME 2017 was the second year that error rates were issued for the generation of programme 2014-2020 managed by the EACEA and the results are encouraging (0 % as regards Europe for Citizens programme). Given simplification measures and control measures that are planned to be implemented, it can be concluded that the level of non-compliance for the actions foreseen is expected to be under the 2% threshold. Estimation of costs of control for actions managed by the EACEA 1. During the selection and the contract management phases 1.1 Staff costs ",
        "EN 40 EN The estimation is calculated taking into account control activities carried out under the current Europe for Citizens Programme: - by operational and financial staff having initiation and verification roles - in all phases of the project life cycle (selection, contracting and payments). Number of staff carrying out control activities - Standard costs / year: Contractual agents: 6.6 x 74,000 EUR = 488,400 EUR Temporary Agents: 1.6 x 143,000 EUR = 228,800 EUR Total for the Programme duration: 5,020,400 EUR 1.2. Other costs - Standard costs / year On the spot Missions: 20 x 825 EUR= 16,500 EUR Audit certificates to be provided by beneficiaries: 86,000 EUR Total for the Programme duration: 717,500 EUR 2. Ex-post controls 2.1 Staff Number of staff carrying out control activities - Standard costs / year Contractual agents: 0.25 X 74,000 EUR =18,500 EUR Temporary Agents: 0.05 X 143,000 EUR = 7,150 EUR Total for the Programme duration: 179,500 EUR 2.2. Ex-post audits Random, risk-based & ad-hoc audits - Standard costs / year: 10, 500\u20ac x 10 = 105 ,000 EUR Total for the Programme duration: 735,000 EUR. Total costs of controls in EACEA compared to the operational budget potentially to be managed Given an operational budget of 204 MIO EUR for this strand \"Citizens' engagement and participation\", the total cost of control for actions managed by EACEA is approximately 3.5% of the budget 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy.. In addition to the application of all regulatory control mechanisms, the programme will be implemented by DGs that also implement the Commission's anti-fraud strategy (CAFS) adopted on 24 June 2011 to ensure inter alia that its internal anti- fraud related controls are aligned with the CAFS and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk areas and adequate responses. There after some measures envisages mitigating potential fraud and irregularities, the following measures: - The prevention of potential fraud and irregularities is considered already at the programme set up, by the simplification of rules and the wider use of flat rates and lump sums. ",
        "EN 41 EN - Systematic check of potential double funding and identification of beneficiaries of several grants will be done. - Ad hoc audits will be implemented when there are serious concerns in terms of irregularities and/or suspected fraud. - The Executive Agency will have to report potential fraud and irregularities to the Commission ad hoc as well as in their regular reporting. - decisions, agreements and contracts resulting from the implementation of the programme will expressly entitle the Commission, including OLAF, and the Court of Auditors to conduct audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections; - the procedure to award grants comprises several fraud-detection elements, such as the widespread use of the 4-eyes principle, verifying the correctness and transparency of award procedures, having detailed procedures to avoid conflicts of interests, verifying whether appl icants have been \u2018blacklisted\u2019 pursuant to Regulation 1605/2002, use of IT- tools like EDES and ARACHNE and looking out for other \u2018red flags\u2019 (fraud indicators). Following a study by an external contractor that is to be finalised in mid-2018, the JAFS will be reviewed and DG EMPL\u2019s contribution to the CAFS updated. ",

        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL Reasons and objectives Europe's rich cultural heritage and dynamic cultural and creative sectors are a part of European identity. Culture and cultural expressions manifest themselves strongly in the daily life of the Union's citizens and can contribute to wellbeing, active citizenship, common values, social inclusion and the development of intercultural dialogues as well as of a free, pluralistic and diverse media environment. The cultural and creative sectors fully contribute to the Union's economic development, generating jobs and growth, and are thus key for Europe's future. These sectors have also the power to shape our aspirations and relations to others and to the world, as well as the places and landscapes where we live or the lifestyles we develop. They promote European excellence on the world stage, reinforcing the Union's global position. European support to culture and the audiovisual sector has been provided through various funding programmes for many years. The Creative Europe programme 2014-2020 constitutes a unique platform for coordinated and constructive support to them across the continent. The current proposal builds on this experience and sets out to continue and strengthen well working elements, including via a reinforced budget which reflects the European Union's commitment to the sectors and the recognition of their essential role in our Union. Through the many activities and projects it will fund, the proposal will be a key enabler to reinforce European cultural and creative sectors, and to unlock their full potential in an economic, social and international perspective. Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union states that the \" Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its people \" and, among others, \" it shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced\" . Along these lines, the Commission's reflection paper on the future of EU finances states that \"the EU budget supports this aim, working together with national budgets and complementing other efforts at European and national level \". To promote the competitiveness and cultural and linguistic diversity of the audiovisual industry, the EU has used several instruments combining legislation, policy support and funding. The Digital Single Market strategy for Europe calls for a modernisation of the legal framework which in turn requires the adaptation of the EU financial support to the audiovisual industry, to reflect new market trends, changing consumers' patterns and the increasing convergence between linear and non-linear services. However, the cultural and creative sectors are facing a number of challenges. First, the cultural and creative sectors in Europe have to face increased competition from new and strong global players such as search engines and web based social platforms. This has led to the need to develop new business models and realise the potential for growth by taking advantage of digital technologies in order to be competitive in a global market. Second, the digital shift is bringing about a change in paradigm, having a massive impact on how cultural goods are created, managed, disseminated, accessed, consumed and monetised, changing the value propositions which prevailed in the analogue era. Digitisation has facilitated the distribution of cultural and creative content and services, but it has also intensified competition of content across borders on a global scale. Third, there is a highly fragmented market for cultural and creative works stemming largely from Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity, which results in the cultural and creative sectors being essentially fragmented along national and linguistic lines and lacking critical mass. This diversity is part of Europe's cultural richness. ",
        "EN 2 EN At the same time, the transnational circulation of works remains limited. It is therefore important to stimulate the transnational circulation and co-production of works across borders and to develop more effective solutions to reach audiences across borders. Fourth, market concentration is a growing concern. In certain cultural and creative fields, a trend is emerging where a limited number of major players account for a large part of global sales. Fifth, Europe's audiovisual industry is internationally recognised but it is not competitive enough within the Digital Single Market. 80% of European films are national productions but co-productions travel better than national films. In some countries, audio-visual professionals need to strengthen their capacity to operate. Finally, there is a growing phenomenon of disinformation. Content industries, in particular the news media sector, are at the core of the fight to maintain a culture of healthy democratic debate. Artistic freedom and diverse and free media environment are central to conveying diverging opinions and perspectives. They contribute to pluralistic societies where citizens are able to make informed choices, including in the context of political elections. These challenges of a trans-national nature require a targeted European approach to optimise the potential of the sectors to contribute to jobs, growth and social inclusion, including for the most disadvantaged and hard-to-reach groups. They are common to all EU Member States and have cross- border dimensions. Indeed, while action at national level is important, the single Member States on their own do not have enough leverage to fully address them. The aim of this initiative is to build on the Creative Europe Programme's achievements and scale up efforts with a view to meeting the objectives set in relation to more recent policy developments. The new Creative Europe programme intends to offer opportunities for operators to develop technologically and artistically innovative European trans-border initiatives to exchange, co-create, co- produce and distribute European works and make them accessible to a wide and diverse audience. It will intensify testing new business models enabling creators to make best use of digital technology for creation and audience development. In order to face increasingly competitive international markets, the new Programme will support cross- border partnerships and networks as well as new collaboration models, to encourage the scaling up of Europe\u2019s cultural and creative sectors. This will strengthen the position of European actors in the European and global markets for instance by supporting their international presence, marketing and branding. The programme will invest in developing creative capacities of artists and industry professionals by allowing them to collaborate across borders. It will support initiatives that allow more people to participate in culture and thus contribute to a socially more inclusive European society. The revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive will provide further opportunities for the promotion of European works, but accompanying support measures are needed to help make European non- national works more widely available across Europe and beyond. The new Programme will tackle the challenges that the audiovisual sector is facing \u2013 including the digital shift \u2013 by fostering cooperation across the value chain \u2013 from the early stages of production to distribution and exhibition. It will specifically support projects with high circulation potential and a global market approach and access to content across all platforms. The new Programme will also support actions aiming at reinforcing Europe\u2019s news medi a sector, journalistic freedom, diversity and pluralism of journalistic content, as well as a critical approach to media content through media literacy. This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of 27 Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and Euratom based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017. ",
        "EN 3 EN Consistency with existing policy provisions This initiative contributes to the ambition expressed in Rome in March 2017 by the 27 Member States and EU institutions for a Union \"where citizens have new opportunities for cultural and social development and economic growth [...]; a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and promotes cultural diversity\" 1 . This ambition was confirmed at the Gothenburg Leaders' Summit in November 2017 and by the European Council in December 2017, which highlighted the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage 2 as a pivotal opportunity to increase awareness of the social and economic importance of culture and heritage. It is consistent with the Communication on Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture 3 , where the Commission stated that it is \"in the shared interest of all Member States to harness the full potential of education and culture as drivers for jobs, economic growth, social fairness, active citizenship as well as a means to experience European identity in all its diversity\". The initiative is in line with the 2018 Commission Communication on a New European Agenda for Culture 4 , the 2016 Joint EEAS/Commission Communication \"Towards an EU strategy for international cultural relations\" 5 and the 2014 Commission Communication \"Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe\" 6 , which all plead for a stronger role for culture in the further social, economic and international development of our Union. The initiative is consistent with the 2018 Commission Communic ation \u201cTackling online disinformation: a European Approach\u201d 7 , in particular with its overarching objective of promoting \u201cdiversity of information, in order to enable citizens to make informed decisions based on critical thinking, through support to high quality journalism, media literacy, and the rebalancing of the relation between information creators and distributors\u201d. Finally, the initiative takes into account the renewed EU Industrial Policy strategy, adopted in September 2017 8 , which highlighted the need to upgrade European industry for the digital age by supporting innovation and creativity, supporting skills development and providing a favourable environment for entrepreneurship and the scale-up of dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises. Concerning more particularly the audiovisual sector, the MEDIA strand will accompany EU Digital Single Market policies. These include in particular the proposals to modernise the copyright framework as well as the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive. The latter will strengthen the capacity of European audiovisual players to finance, produce and disseminate works that can be sufficiently visible on the different media available ( such as TV, cinema or Video on Demand) and are attractive to audiences in an increasingly open and competitive market within Europe and beyond. Support must be scaled up in order to address recent market developments, including the stronger position of global distribution platforms in comparison to national broadcasters traditionally investing in the production of European works. 1 Rome Declaration, March 2017 2 EYCH 2018: https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/ 3 COM(2017) 673 final 4 COM(2018) 267 final. 5 JOIN/2016/029 6 COM/2014/0477 final 7 COM(2018) 236 final 8 COM(2017) 479 final ",
        "EN 4 EN The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. The contribution of this programme to the achievement of this overall target will be tracked through an EU climate marker system at an appropriate level of disaggregation, including the use of more precise methodologies where these are available. The Commission will continue to present the information annually in terms of commitment appropriations in the context of the annual draft budget. To support the full utilisation of the potential of the programme to contribute to climate objectives, the Commission will seek to identify relevant actions throughout the programme preparation, implementation, review and evaluation processes. The Programme will promote gender equality and contribute to achieving a more balanced gender participation in the cultural and creative industries. Consistency with other Union policies and programmes The Programme will be consistent and complementary to other Union instruments, in particular Erasmus+, the Funds covered by Regulation (\u2026) [the Comm on Provisions Regulation], including the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, the Horizon Europe Programme as well as the external financing instruments. Based on the Treaty's mainstreaming provision and the new political approach based on cultural crossovers, as set out in the New European Agenda for Culture, the programme aims at developing synergies with the following policy areas. (1) Synergies with education and youth policies The future Erasmus programme will be an important complement to the Creative Europe programme. Cooperation between institutions and organisations active in education, training and youth, supported by Erasmus+, will help equip individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to face social and economic challenges as well as fulfil their potential for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, in particular within the digital economy. Activities linked to reinforcing all aspects of creativity in education and enhancing individual key competencies, will constitute a major link between both programmes. In addition, within the framework of the European Solidarity Corps, there will be increased opportunities to attract young people dedicated to restoring or preserving cultural heritage sites. (2) Synergies with the Rights and Values programme There are strong links \u2013 notably in the fields of media pluralism, European identity, values and cultural heritage \u2013 between the Creative Europe programme and the Rights and Values programme that will empower citizens through the promotion and protection of rights, values and equality and through creating opportunities for engagement, participation and remembrance. (3) Synergies with employment and social policies The future European Social Fund + will be a major building block of the \"Investing in People, Social Cohesion and Values\" cluster. It will provide support to citizens by investing in human capital, supporting (youth) employment, social innovation, the acquisition of basic digital skills and the integration of migrants, and by supporting the most deprived (social inclusion). As such, there are strong links with the objectives of the Creative Europe programme. Cultural and linguistic diversity \u2013 which Creative Europe aims at reinforcing, for example through enhancing the circulation of European cultural and audiovisual works across borders \u2013 are important aspects of inclusive societies as they contribute to intercultural dialogue. Furthermore, by reinforcing the competitiveness of cultural and creative sectors, the programme favours the creation of jobs in these sectors. ",
        "EN 5 EN (4) Synergies with regional, urban and rural policies The EU's regional, urban and rural development policies are instrumental in promoting the restoration of cultural heritage and supporting cultural and creative industries. Potential synergies will be ensured to reinforce the complementarity between these instruments and Creative Europe, which can support peer learning on meaningful long-term cultural investment plans for creative industries, tourism, social inclusion, cultural heritage restauration based on quality standards of renovation of cultural heritage and increasing their contribution to the objectives of the regional and urban development and financial self-sustainability of cultural projects. (5) Synergies with the Single Market Creative Europe will complement the actions funded by the future Single Market Programme where the aspects of empowering people and fostering creative talent in the respective sectors are concerned. Synergies can also be found with tourism which has a cultural dimension and can be seen as a way of enhancing mutual understanding among people. Creative Europe will focus its interventions, where adequate, on the creativity and cultural elements of certain creative industries (such as design and fashion) by concentrating on promotion or skills development, cross-border cooperation and mobility. Complementarity will be also ensured with actions supporting the tourism industry. (6) Synergies with Digital programme Within the Digital Europe programme two leadership projects will assure the continuation of deployment activities linked to the #Digital4Culture strategy. The leadership project on digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector will continue to support European initiative launched during the European Year on Cultural Heritage 2018. The part of the programme focusing on digital skills has synergies with issues such as media literacy and film education. (7) Synergies with the EU research and innovation programme Pooling resources in order to apply the latest technologies and stimulate new scientific approaches can greatly improve the understanding, preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage and in the cultural and creative sector in general. Potential synergies will need to be strengthened to reinforce the complementarity between these instruments and Creative Europe, so that the cultural and creative sectors fully benefit from the advances of European research. In the Horizon Europe programme, the cluster on \"Inclusive, Resilient and Secure Societies\" includes support research and innovation activities for the development of ICT technologies for the digitisation and preservation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage. The \"Digital Industry\" cluster foresees, within the Next Generation Internet area of interventions, research activities which are closely linked to the cultural and creative industries - e.g. Augmented reality/Virtual reality, immersive environments, human computer interfaces, new (social) media. It is also foreseen to continue efforts to achieve crossovers between the creative sectors, in particular the arts, and innovation in industry and society via the S+T+ARTS programme. (8) Synergies with the external action policies Creative Europe and the international collaboration actions financed through the Union external programmes will complement each other. The CULTURE strand intends to test shadowing schemes and other exchange initiatives with third countries for the European Capitals of Culture initiative or to open the Networks and Platforms schemes or the competition for the EU cultural Prizes to a limited extent to non-EU countries, to develop incentives to foster the inclusion of third country partners in projects where organisations in ",

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis The initiative will be based on Articles 167 and 173 of TFEU. Article 167 TFEU specifies the Union's competences in the cultural field and calls for action by the European Union to contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore and, if necessary, to support and supplement Member State action in the area listed by this provision. Article 173 TFEU states that the Union and the Member States shall ensure that the conditions necessary for the competitiveness of the Union's industry exist, including taking action to encourage an environment favourable to initiative and to the development of undertakings. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The main EU added value comes from the strong transnational dimension of the programme as already demonstrated in the Creative Europe programme 2014-2020. The mid-term evaluation found the objectives and priorities of the programme to be overall coherent and complementary with those of national policies and programmes, thus respecting the principle of subsidiarity. In particular, the multilateral transnational nature of Creative Europe provides a distinctive offer that is rarely matched by national funding, which tends to focus more on domestic activities and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 on bilateral transnational cooperation. This multilateral transnational focus is highly valued by stakeholders and beneficiaries as a unique element of Creative Europe. Only a few other existing international funds support transnational cooperation in the cultural and creative sectors at all and those that do are of significantly smaller scale. Elements of EU added value of the programme are : \uf0b7 The cross-border circulation of cultural and creative works, in particular audiovisual works reaching out to larger and more diverse audiences within the Union and beyond, to reflect European diversity; \uf0b7 Economies of scale and critical mass which EU support can foster, creating a leverage effect on additional funds; the reputational effect for programmes\u2019 beneficiaries increases the potential interest of partners and financial intermediaries and their trust in supported projects, facilitating access to additional funding; The creation of European networks and cross-border partnerships, which constitute the main and the most durable structuring elements of Creative Europe and support the overall capability of operators; \uf0b7 Transnational networks also increase the capability of the culture and creative operators overall and especially for those working in niche fields and in the Member States where such capabilities are less developed; \uf0b7 Result-oriented cross-border mobility for culture and creative operators leads to skills development and increased sectors' capacity; \uf0b7 The mitigation of risks for cultural and creative organisations, which allows them to engage in projects with a European dimension and thus contributing to their overall economic strength; \uf0b7 The programme has a strong societal focus; by supporting cultural and linguistic diversity, artistic and creative freedom as well as the development of a free, pluralistic and diverse ",
        "EN 7 EN media environment, it thus contributes to European social well-being and a shared European identity; \uf0b7 While film support schemes at national level focus primarily on the production of works, EU support intervenes primarily on actions upstream (training, development) and downstream (distribution, promotion, exhibition) in order to ensure that European works circulate better across borders. As such, it promotes the free circulation of audiovisual media services enhanced by the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. Proportionality The proposal complies with the proportionality principle in that it does not go beyond the minimum required in order to achieve the stated objective at European level and what is necessary for that purpose. Choice of the instrument The new Creative Europe 2021-2027 builds on the current Creative Europe Programme (2014-2020), which brought together two independent sub-programmes (MEDIA and Culture) within a single framework. This takes into account the specific features of the different sectors, their different target groups, and their particular needs. This concerns in particular the opportunities of a common, cross- sectoral strand where innovation and experimentation will be in the focus. Maintaining the well-established brand of the Creative Europe programme, including the MEDIA brand, will help to ensure continued engagement as well as the visibility of EU support. 3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation The interim evaluation of the Creative Europe Programme and an ex-post evaluation of the three predecessor programmes \u2013 Culture, MEDIA 2007 and MEDIA Mundus \u2013 were commissioned by the European Commission in 2016 and delivered in the period May 2016 to August 2017. The evaluations of the Creative Europe and predecessor programmes pursued the following objectives: \uf0b7 To assess the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and EU added value (hereafter the evaluation criteria) of Creative Europe and predecessor programmes; \uf0b7 To assess the contribution of Creative Europe to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, to the new Commission priorities and sector strategies; \uf0b7 To assess the long-term results and impact of the predecessor programmes. According to the evaluation, Creative Europe was found to address both the ongoing and emerging needs of the cultural and creative sectors. With adequate support from the programme, the beneficiaries from the cultural and creative sectors across Europe can take action in response to the digital shift to display their work internationally in the spirit of cultural diversity, in particular through innovation and the development of new business models enhancing their competitiveness. Creative Europe is also largely coherent with other EU priorities, funding and support mechanisms relevant to the cultural and creative sectors, including both sector-specific opportunities and generic financing, business, and economic support for SMEs. The Creative Europe Programme was also found to deliver on the strategic EU priorities: the Programme is making an important contribution towards the EU2020 employment target and the ",
        "EN 8 EN priorities of the current Commission \u2013 stimulating investment for the purpose of job creation, and a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base, and also to sectoral strategies at EU-level, such as the objectives of the Digital Single Market. The evaluation concluded that considering the size and range of the cultural and creative sectors at European level and the geographical areas covered by the evaluated Programmes, the size of the budgets of Creative Europe and its predecessor programmes were not sufficient to create major impact of a European scale and/or at sectoral level. The evaluation showed further that the MEDIA sub-programme has effectively contributed to deepening the internal market. At the same time, MEDIA has grown in scope over the years without an equivalent increase in budget. Thus, the funding is spread too thinly across many priorities, weakening its potential impact. Stakeholder consultations T HE OPEN PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON EU FUNDS IN THE AREA OF VALUES AND MOBILITY The purpose of the public consultation on EU funds in the area of values and mobility was to collect the views of all interested parties on how to make the most of every euro of the EU budget. Consultations have taken place in the context of evaluations of existing EU financial programmes covering several policy areas, including on current performance and future challenges. Hereafter some of the main results: (1) According to the respondents, \"Promoting European identity and common values\" as well as \"promoting rights and equality\" are important common policy challenges to be addressed in those programmes. For the Creative Europe programme, economic challenges and cultural diversity are more important than \"Promoting social inclusion and fairness\". (2) \"Supporting innovation\", \"Fostering European cultural diversity and cultural heritage\", \"Promoting European identity and common values\" are considered as policies that fully or fairly well address the challenges by half or more of the respondents. Additionally 52 % of the respondents 9 experienced in the Creative Europe programme consider that the policy to \"Support competitiveness of European cultural and creative sectors\" addresses the challenges fully or fairly well. (3) Around 80% of the respondents with some kind of experience in the above mentioned EU Programmes agree that these programmes add value to a large extent or to a fairly good extent to what Member States could achieve at national, regional and/or local levels. (4) The main obstacles identified by the respondents that could prevent the current programmes/funds from achieving their objectives are very similar regardless of the programme concerned: \"Lack of budget of the programmes to satisfy demand\"; \"Insufficient support provided to small-scale stakeholders\"; \"Lack of support to first-time applicants\" are identified as the main three obstacles. (5) Respondents with some kind of experience in one or more of the EU Programmes, agree that \"the use of more simplified application forms\", \"facilitating structured network and partnerships\", \"facilitating funding for actions cutting across the sectors of action\" as well as \"better coordination between different programmes/funds\" are the main steps to be taken to simplify and reduce the administrative burdens for beneficiaries. 9 1839 replies were received from all over Europe. ",
        "EN 9 EN O THER OPEN PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS As part of the interim evaluation of the Creative Europe Programme, an open public consultation took place from 23 January to 24 April 2017. It included forward-looking questions regarding a possible successor programme to Creative Europe after 2020. Regarding the Creative Europe Culture and MEDIA sub-programmes, 90% and 80 % respectively of the respondents said that most of its priorities were still relevant or extremely relevant and more than a half agreed that the support provided by the Culture Sub-programme was either fully or partially complementary to national, EU or international funding. The most important opportunities mentioned by the survey respondents include shared cultural values, supporting cultural education, promoting cultural diversity, supporting internationalisation and promoting the significance of culture in society. External expertise In addition to the results of the public consultation, the Commission has taken into account the results of the interim evaluation of the current Creative Europe programme carried out in 2017-2018, feedback from various stakeholders, in particular in the context of the European Film Forum 10 and a series of music stakeholder thematic meetings, findings of independent studies, as well as recommendations made by experts from Member States in the context of the Open Method of Coordination on culture and on the circulation of European films, and the structured dialogue with the sector over the period 2014-2018. These various sources highlighted the many positive benefits of Creative Europe, but also identified areas for improvement and simplification. Whereas the current programme\u2019s overarching objectives (promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity, reinforcement of the competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors) remain broadly valid, there is a need for some further integration and expansion in order to better respond to the needs and shortfalls identified, which have only been exacerbated in recent years: (1) Increasing pressure on European cultural diversity and heritage, combined with growing dominance and circulation works from third countries, in particular the US, (2) Insufficient circulation and audience reach of European works, (3) Insufficient and fragile competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors, (4) Lack of training and mobility opportunities for artists and creative professionals, (5) Lack of internationalisation of European culture, (6) Difficulties in reaching audiences and in ensuring social inclusion, (7) Limited adaptation and preparedness for the digital shift, (8) Lack of capacity building of professionals and the professionalization of individuals, (9) Specific challenges for the audiovisual industry in the context of an increasingly integrated Digital Single Market, (10) Specific sectorial challenges, in particular for the music sector, the book and publishing sector and the architecture & heritage sector. Impact assessment An impact assessment was prepared to support the \u201cCreative Europe\u201d, \u201cRights and Values\u201d and \u201cJustice\u201d programmes. Although the Commission has decided that it is more appropriate to take 10 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-film-forum ",
        "EN 10 EN forward this work through two separate programmes, the findings of the combined impact assessment remain relevant and are applicable to both the culture and MEDIA sub-programmes. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board gave a positive opinion to such impact assessment on 20 April 2018. At the same time, it highlighted that the links among the evaluations\u2019 findings, the input from stakeholders, the various objectives, and the rationale for the structure of the programme should be better explained. It also mentioned the need for additional guarantees that the monitoring and evaluation framework will allow for a robust and objective assessment of the level of success of the programme. This initiative takes into account the Board\u2019s comments. It builds on the structure of the existing Creative Europe programme and better reflects the feedback from stakeholders. For example, in response to a demand for more scalability, the new MEDIA strand will ensure the possibility to develop coordinated actions bringing together different parts of the audiovisual value chain. Furthermore, the monitoring and evaluation system for the whole programme will be reinforced with appropriate impact and output indicators. Simplification In order to simplify the future programme compared with the current Creative Europe programme: \uf0b7 Greater flexibility will be imbedded within the programme in order to adapt work programmes to unforeseen circumstances or new technological or societal developments, and reward performance; \uf0b7 Greater effectiveness and efficiency will be sought by an increased use of framework partnership agreements and cascading grants to provide financial stability and facilitate access to smaller players. The already successful exchange of learning during the implementation of projects and the dissemination of results of this learning will be further enhanced; \uf0b7 MEDIA will introduce incentives to reward results, related in particular to the capacity of reaching out to large audiences (e.g., audiovisual projects that achieve good box office results); \uf0b7 The future music sectorial actions, as well as the translation scheme will include award criteria rewarding market success and efforts to reach audiences; \uf0b7 Effective transitions arrangements will be designed to facilitate the association to the new programme of the third countries which were previously associated to Creative Europe 2014/2020; \uf0b7 Greater clarity will be provided within its guidelines, and processes and procedures will involve systematic use of e-forms and e-reports and lighter reporting requirements. A coherent set of rules (single rulebook) will be introduced, while leaving room for differentiated approaches when needed. Substantial simplification measures such as lump sums, unit costs and flat rates have already been successfully introduced by other programmes and could be introduced in the new Creative Europe. The specificity of the cultural sector and the individual character of the supported actions have made the calculation and application of lump sum and flat-rates challenging (outside the literary translation scheme) but where the calculation basis can be lightened it would constitute a welcome reduction of administrative burden for beneficiaries. Lump sums will continue to be used in MEDIA in order to simplify financial management, when appropriate. The methodology for calculating the lump sums will foresee a regular monitoring to ensure alignment with real costs. The complexity of funding rules of the current programmes, as well as their heterogeneity represents an obstacle for applicants. The use of a single entry point for external users to participate in the grants ",
        "EN 11 EN life cycle (i.e. a participant portal), including an overall grant management system has an important role to play in simplifying the access to the programme. MEDIA support will be made more effective by streamlining actions and their corresponding financial transactions; while CULTURE will continue focussing on the successful actions and tackle newly emerging market failures by specifically targeted sectoral action. Overall, stakeholders from the culture and creative sectors will be able to benefit of a \"one-stop-shop\" approach. Fundamental rights This proposal is fully consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the EU. In particular, this proposal takes full account of Article 11 (freedom of expression), 13 (freedom of the arts and science), 15 (freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work), 21 (non-discrimination), 22 (cultural diversity), 23 (equality between women and men), 31 (fair and just working conditions) of the Charter. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The financial envelope for the implementation of the Creative Europe Programme for the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027 will amount to EUR 1 850 000 000 (current prices). Further details on the budgetary implications and the human and administrative resources required are provided in the Legislative and Financial Statement attached to this proposal. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The existing funding programmes, with the exception of activities in the field of news media, are mainly implemented through direct management through the Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture (EACEA) because this is cost-effective, as confirmed by the mid-term evaluation. According to the existing evaluations, there is no need to change management mode. \uf0b7 Implementation of MEDIA will be simplified and streamlined, for example, by grouping together beneficiaries and reducing the number of underlying grant contracts and payment transactions. Building on the on-going streamlining of the Distribution schemes, which represent 30% of the MEDIA budget, the objective will be to reduce the overall MEDIA transactions by 30%, thus lowering administrative overheads and increasing the efficiency of the programme. \uf0b7 Financial instruments providing guarantee and where needed equity type support to SMEs in the cultural and creative sectors will be implemented through the Invest EU Fund in indirect management mode by delegation agreements with implementing partners in line with the Financial Regulation. Evaluations will be carried out in line with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 11 , where the three institutions confirmed that evaluations of existing legislation and policy should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action. The evaluations will assess the programme's effects on the ground based on the programme indicators/targets and a detailed analysis of the degree to which the programme can be deemed relevant, effective, efficient, provides enough EU added value and is coherent with other EU policies. They will include lessons 11 Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016 (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1).

It will bring together project and beneficiary data (collected via e-forms and e-reports) with additional contextual information from the European Audiovisual Observatory or targeted studies. Indicators will reflect realistically available information for each of the strands. Programme monitoring will take place both continuously (to respond timely to any unforeseen events or exceptional needs) and on a regularly planned basis (to report on key events such as calls for proposals, project reviews, coordination or dissemination events). The monitoring will subsequently feed into: \uf0b7 An annual monitoring report giving an overview of the progress achieved in meeting the objectives of the programme; \uf0b7 A mid-term evaluation (to be performed no later than four years after the start of programme implementation); \uf0b7 A final evaluation to be performed no later than two years after the end of the programming period. These retrospective evaluations will be carried out in compliance with the latest applicable version of the Better Regulation guidelines (drawing also on its toolbox guidance and best practice), assess the programme's performance based on the key programme indicators/targets and a detailed analysis of the degree to which the programme can be deemed relevant, effective, efficient, provides enough EU added value and is coherent with other EU policies. They will include recommendations to address any lacks/problems identified or any potential to further improve the actions or their results and to help maximise their exploitation/impact. Reporting to the European Parliament, Council and all other relevant EU institutions will take place regularly, through main monitoring and evaluation reports and a public scoreboard of the key programme indicators. Subject to the result of the Cost Benefit Analysis that will be performed centrally for the next programming period, a significant part of the programme will likely be implemented by the Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture under the supervision of the DGs responsible for the programme. Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal This proposal will build on and continue the existing structure of the Creative Europe Programme with Culture, MEDIA and a reinforced cross-sectoral strand, which will allow for innovative action where cross-over activity provides added value. The architecture and objectives of Creative Europe were confirmed by the mid-term evaluation 12 and other relevant feed-back. However, adaptations are needed to mirror economic, technological, societal and political developments as explained above. For example, the new programme includes more focussed approaches for existing actions, but also newly developed elements. The CULTURE strand will continue supporting transnational partnerships, networks and platforms and will develop sector specific initiatives, it will support cultural and creative operators in their efforts to reach audiences in Europe and beyond and it will develop elements which bring to the specific social benefits of culture for individuals and society to the fore.

The Rome Declaration of 25 March 2017 as well as the European Council in December 2017 stated that education and culture are key to building inclusive and cohesive societies for all, and to sustaining European competitiveness. (2) According to Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights, including the rights of the persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society where pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail. These values are further reaffirmed and articulated in the rights, freedoms and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same legal value as the Treaties, as referred to in Article 6 of the TEU.

Creative Europe, together with other Union programmes, should support the implementation of this New European Agenda for Culture. This is also in line with the 2005 UNESCO Convention for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, which entered into force on 18 March 2007 and to which the Union is a party. (5) The promotion of European cultural diversity depends on the existence of flourishing and resilient cultural and creative sectors, able to create, produce and distribute their works to a large and diverse European audience. This thereby enlarges their business potential and contributes to sustainable growth and jobs creation. In addition, promotion of creativity contributes to boosting competitiveness and sparkling innovation in the industrial value chains. In spite of recent progress, the European cultural and creative market continues to be fragmented along national and linguistic lines, which do not allow the cultural and creative sectors to fully benefit from the European single market and the digital single market in particular. (6) The Programme should take into account the dual nature of the cultural and creative sectors, recognising, on the one hand, the intrinsic and artistic value of culture and, on the other, the economic value of those sectors, including their broader contribution to growth and competitiveness, creativity and innovation. This requires strong European cultural and creative sectors, in particular a vibrant European audiovisual industry, taking into account its capacity to reach large audiences and its economic importance, including for other creative sectors as well as cultural tourism. However, competition in global audiovisual markets has been further intensified by the deepening digital disruption e.g. changes in media production, consumption and the growing position of global platforms in the distribution of content. Therefore, there is a need to step-up the support to the European industry. (7) To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature of the different sectors, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches within a strand dedicated to the audiovisual sector, a strand dedicated to the other cultural and creative sectors and a cross-sectoral strand. (8) The cross-sectoral strand aims at exploiting the potential of collaboration among different cultural and creative sectors. There are benefits in terms of knowledge-transfer and administrative efficiencies to be gained from a joint transversal approach. (9) Union intervention is needed in the audiovisual sector to accompany the Union\u2019s Digital Single Market policies. This concerns notably the modernisation of the copyright framework and the proposed Regulation on online transmissions of broadcasting organisations 16 , as well as the proposal to amend Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 . They seek to strengthen the capacity of European audiovisual players to finance, produce and disseminate works that can be sufficiently visible on the different media of communication available (e.g. TV, cinema or Video On Demand) and attractive to audiences in a more open and competitive market within Europe and beyond. Support should be scaled up in order to address recent market developments and notably the stronger position of global platforms of distribution in comparison to national broadcasters traditionally investing in the production of European works. 16 COM(2016) 594 final 17 COM/2016/0287 final ",

(11) Culture is key to strengthen inclusive and cohesive communities. In the context of migration pressure, culture has an important role in the integration of migrants to help them feel part of host societies and develop good relations between migrants and new communities. (12) Artistic freedom is at the core of vibrant cultural and creative industries, including the news media sector. The programme should promote cross-overs and collaboration between the audiovisual sector and the publishing sector to promote a pluralistic media environment. (13) In line with Articles 8 and 10 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Programme in all its activities should support gender mainstreaming and the mainstreaming of non-discrimination objectives and, where applicable, should define appropriate gender balance criteria. (14) In line with the Joint Communication \"Towards an EU strategy for international cultural relations\", endorsed by the European Parliament's resolution of 5 July 2017 18 , European funding instruments and in particular this programme should recognize the relevance of culture in international relations and its role in promoting European values by dedicated and targeted actions designed to have a clear Union impact on the global scene. (15) In line with the Commission Communication \"Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe\" of 22 July 2014 19 , relevant policies and instruments should draw out the long term and sustainability value of Europe's cultural heritage and develop a more integrated approach to its preservation and valorisation and support.

Title of the proposal/initiative Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing the Creative Europe programme and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1295/2013 1.2. Policy area(s) concerned (Programme cluster) Investing in People, Social Cohesion and Values, Creative Europe (Culture and audiovisual (MEDIA) 1.3. The proposal/initiative relates to: \uf0a8 a new action \uf0a8 a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action 31 \uf078 the extension of an existing action \uf0a8 a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action 1.4. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.4.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative. The new Creative Europe 2021-2027 will allow further exploiting and bring to the fore the potential to tackle common challenges and creating common opportunities as built up in the first generation (2014-2020) of a joint programme for the cultural and creative sectors. This concerns in particular the opportunities of a common, cross- sectoral strand where innovation will be in the focus. Maintaining the well- established brand of the Creative Europe programme will help to ensure continued engagement as well as the visibility of EU support. 1.4.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. Reasons for action at European level (ex-ante) The mid-term evaluation of the predecessor programme showed that its objectives and priorities were overall coherent and complementary with those of national policies and programmes, thus respecting the principle of subsidiarity. In particular, the multilateral transnational nature of Creative Europe provides a distinctive offer that is rarely matched by national funding. It also showed that the programme addresses the major challenges for these sectors, notably the access to finance, the market fragmentation for cultural works as well as digitization and globalization. The Creative Europe Programme was also found to deliver on the strategic EU priorities such as the EU2020 employment targets, stimulating job creation and a fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base and sectoral strategies at EU-level such as 31 As referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation. ",
        "EN 32 EN the Digital Single Market. An open public consultation accompanying the mid-term review as well as a more encompassing one implemented from January to March 2018 confirmed that a substantial majority of respondents agreed that the respective challenges were fairly well addressed by Creative Europe. These findings were confirmed by other external expertise and feed-back collected, inter alia, via the Open Method of Coordination, the structured dialogue with the sector and other fora such as the European Film Forum. Expected generated Union added value (ex-post) The cross-border circulation of works, including audiovisual works; The creation of international networks and cross-border partnerships, which constitute the main and the most durable structuring elements of Creative Europe; Transnational networks also increase the capability of the cultural and creative operators overall and especially for those working in niche fields and in the Member States where such capabilities are less developed; Cross-border mobility for cultural and creative operators in a project and result- oriented approach leads to skills development and will reinforce the sectors' capacity; The support of organisations in taking (calculated) risks, which allows them to focus on operating with a European dimension; The reputational effect for programmes\u2019 beneficiaries that increases the potential interest of partners and financial intermediaries and their trust in supported projects. This reputational aspect was also reported to facilitate access to additional funding; The programme has a strong societal focus as by supporting cultural and linguistic diversity, as well as artistic and creative freedom, the EU sends and receives meaningful and relevant messages to and from the European citizens, thus contributing to European social well-being; At the same time, Creative Europe also has a positive impact on the economy of the Union as a whole by supporting creation, promotion and circulation of cultural goods and access to cultural services as well as the competitiveness of Europe's cultural and creative sectors While film support schemes at national level focus primarily on the production of works, EU support intervenes on actions upstream (training, development) and downstream (distribution, promotion, exhibition) with the exception of TV co-productions in order to ensure that European works circulate better across borders, are visible and thrive in all distribution channels including online; EU support accompanies the free circulation of audiovisual media services enhanced by the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and in particular, the prominence of European works in catalogues of Video on Demand services. 1.4.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past According to both the mid-term evaluation and the open public consultations, the main obstacles identified by the respondents that could prevent the current programmes/funds from achieving their objectives are \"Lack of budget of the programmes to satisfy demand\"; \"Insufficient support provided to small-scale stakeholders\"; \"Lack of support to first-time applicants\" are identified as the main three obstacles. ",
        "EN 33 EN Respondents with experience in one or more of the EU Programmes, agree that \"the use of more simplified application forms\", \"facilitating structured network and partnerships\", \"facilitating funding for actions cutting across the sectors of action\" as well as \"better coordination between different programmes/funds\" are the main steps to be taken to simplify and reduce the administrative burdens for beneficiaries. In terms of simplification, the following elements shall be introduced: Greater flexibility will be imbedded within the programme in order to adapt work programmes to unforeseen circumstances or new technological or societal developments, and reward performance. Greater effectiveness and efficiency is required, including increased use of framework partnership agreements and cascading grants to provide financial stability and facilitate access to smaller players. The already successful exchange of learning during the implementation of projects and the dissemination of results of this learning will be further enhanced. The future music sectorial actions, as well as the translation scheme will include award criteria rewarding market success and past performance. Effective transitions arrangements will be designed to facilitate the association to the new programme of the third countries which were previously associated to Creative Europe 2014/2020. Greater clarity will be provided within its guidelines, and processes and procedures will involve systematic use of e-forms and e-reports and lighter reporting requirements. A coherent set of rules (single rulebook) will be introduced, while leaving room for differentiated approaches when needed. Substantial simplification measures such as lump sums, unit costs and flat rates have already been successfully introduced by other programmes and could be introduced in the new Creative Europe. The complexity of funding rules of the current programmes, as well as their heterogeneity represents an obstacle for applicants. The use of a single entry point for external users to participate in the grants life cycle (i.e. a participant portal), including an overall grant management system has an important role to play in simplifying the access to the programme. 1.4.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments The Programme will be consistent and complementary to other Union instruments, in particular Erasmus+, the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), including the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Funds, the next Research and Innovation Framework Programme as well as the external cooperation instruments (NDICI, IPA III and OCT's). Based on the Treaty's mainstreaming provision and the new political approach based on cultural crossovers, as set out in the New European Agenda for Culture, the programme aims at developing synergies with the following policy areas: Education and Youth Policies, Employment and Social Policies, Cohesion and Rural Policies, the Single Market Programme, Strategic Infrastructure such as Digital Europe, Horizon Europe, the Research Programmes as well as External and Development Cooperation Policies.

A mid-term evaluation will take place by 31 December 2024. A final evalution shall be implemented by 31 December 2029. Monitoring will take place in accordance with the requirements agreed in the Memorandum of understanding with EACEA. 2.2. Management and control system(s) 2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed The majority of the programme's actions will probably continue to be implemented by EACEA for cost-efficiency reasons. The current implementing mode so far has also proven to be effective, and the error rates are currently less than 2%, based on preliminary results for the current MFF. The majority of funding will be implemented in particular through grants. These grants will usually be in the form of actual costs but may also be in the form of lump sums, flat rates, unit costs or a combination of these. The use of scales of units costs and other simplified measures will reduce the scope for error in cost claims. Several measures to allow better access for example for smaller organisations, simplification of guidelines and procedures on the basis of the Financial Regulation will be applied (see above). MEDIA will streamline its relatively high number of different actions for better focus. ",
        "EN 36 EN 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them Creative Europe faces the sames risks as other Commission programmes which target smaller beneficiaries which are diverse in nature. In particular, many beneficiaries are not recurring or do not have extensive administrative structures. The majority of Creative Europe will probably continue to be implemented by the EACEA. In 2018 an Internal Audit Service audit of the EACEA on grant management \u2013 phase I (from the call to the signature of contracts), demonstrated internal control system weaknesses, especially in the component III \"Control Activities\" and IV \"Information and Communication\". In particular, the role of the evaluatoin committees as well as the management of external experts in the award of grants needed to be strengthened. In response, the Agency has set up an action plan focusing on the revision of procedures, guidelines and templates. It contains immediate actions (e.g. proper documentation of procedures and immediate changes of procedures applied immediately for the first calls of 2018) and other changes in the EACEA way of working to be implemented by 2018. In particular, adapted procedures regarding the evaluation of calls for proposals were put in place the consequences of which in terms of cost of control are yet to be assessed. The action plan is the responsibility of EACEA, with the support of the parent DGs. Nonetheless, supervision of the EACEA by the parent DGs was reinforced. 2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of \"control costs \u00f7 value of the related funds managed\"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) Following the IAS audit on the EACEA in 2017/18, adapted procedures regarding the evaluation of calls for proposals were put in place the consequences of which in terms of cost of control are yet to be assessed. Monitoring between the parent DGs and EACEA was increased in order to allow for reinforced supervision on behalf of the Commission. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy. Anti-fraud strategies of both EACEA (updated 2018) and the Commission will enable fraud risk to be addressed, mainly via measures to prevent irregularity which are then escalated in the event of fraud detection. The following measures will continue to be implemented, both at the parent DG as in EACEA: Desk monitoring, monitoring missions in accordance with a defined monitoring strategy, clear reporting requirements in the grant agreements with beneficiaries, kick-off meetings with new beneficiaries, possibility to cut grants upon non-delivery of results or non-compliance with certain funding conditions such as those linked to communication.
