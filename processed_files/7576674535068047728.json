        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 1 Executive Summary This study implements a new methodology developed by the JRC IES and IE for estimating changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil and above- and belowground biomass resulting from global land use changes caused by the production of biofuels. The methodology is based on the Tier 1 approach as developed under the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Under this approach, GHG emissions are estimated by comparing the carbon stocks before the land use change with the carbon stocks after the conversion. To calculate the related GHG emissions, the study incorporates the output from global economic models on land use change as input data, namely cropland demands from the general equilibrium model MIRAGE (processed by IFPRI) and from the partial equilibrium model AGLINK-COSIMO (processed by JRC-IPTS). A new approach of the study is the development of a harmonised spatial dataset and advanced analysis methods for all aspects of estimating GHG emissions. In the spatial allocation process, cropland demands provided by economic models are processed using global raster layer with approx. 10 km grid spacing. The outcome of the spatial allocation process allows for the computation of changes in land use, which result in changes in soil carbon stock, N 2 O emissions and levels of carbon in the affected biomass. The output of the IFPRI-MIRAGE analysis was available to the study for two scenarios, assuming \u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d (BAU) and \u201cFree Trade\u201d conditions (FT) respectively. The attribution of total cropland area subject to indirect land use change (ILUC) for 2020 over the reference area is 8,209 km 2 (BAU) and 9,759 km 2 (FT). Most of the additional cropland is assigned to Brazil and the Commonwealth of Independent States, while changes in cropland attributed to ILUC in Europe are small. For the BAU scenario, total GHG emissions from ILUC are estimated at 201 Mt CO 2 eq (BAU) and 248 Mt CO 2 eq (FT) over a period of 20 years. The JRC-IPTS AGLINK-COSIMO simulation calculated the area change due to biofuels policy to be 52,372 km 2 . Major cropland extension occurs in EU27, followed by Brazil, Argentina and some Asian countries. Estimated total GHG emissions are 1,092 Mt CO 2 eq. For all the scenarios, the major contribution (approx. 80%) to total GHG emissions results from the removal of above- and belowground biomass. Changes in soil carbon stock contribute 15 to 20%, whereas N 2 O emissions related to loss in soil carbon stocks make up only a small share (2 - 3%). The emissions estimated by this study from AGLINK-COSIMO input data are about 4 times higher than the figures published by IFPRI in their own study. The differences between the output of the two models, and between that of this study and the IFPRI assessment, are attributed to different assumptions made on the share of crops allocated to bioethanol or biodiesel production, and on the proportion of forest and shrubland converted to cropland to cater for the additional demand.

S TUDY B ACKGROUND The 10% target share of renewable energies in transport set by the Directive 2009/28/EC on the Promotion of the Use of Energy from Renewable Sources (RED) affect energy and agricultural markets and will change the extent and intensity of agricultural land use, since worldwide production of biofuels is growing rapidly (OECD-FAO, 2010, FAO-STAT 1 ). The overall environmental impact and sustainability of biofuels is the objective of intensive societal and political debate in Europe and worldwide. Analysing and modelling the effects of bioenergy policies is a very complex exercise that requires a combination of energy, agro-economic, global land use and so-called \u201cbio-physical\u201d modelling approaches. 1.1. GHG E MISSIONS FROM I NDIRECT L AND U SE C HANGE A particularly controversial topic is how to estimate emissions from indirect land use change (ILUC), when crops for food are diverted to biofuels or bioenergy. Using more (conventional) biofuels in the EU, even if they are produced from EU crops, will increase the overall world demand for crops. If not managed properly, it could displace arable production onto land used for other purposes, both inside and outside the EU, and could lead to extra GHG emissions. In practice, if biofuels crops are grown on uncultivated land, direct land use change will be caused. If crops grown on existing arable land are used for biofuels instead of food, this will cause ILUC because of the necessity to replace the food. Models do not specify where the extra production comes from; they just calculate the total change in crop area for a given increase in biofuel or crop demand. The models thus estimate simply land use change (LUC) and emissions form LUC, and for the purpose of this study the two terms are used indistinguishable. The RED and the Fuel Quality Directive (2009/30/EU) contain provisions on monitoring and limiting the possible ILUC effects, but also give the Commission the task to further explore the issue, in order to establish the most appropriate mechanism for minimising ILUC. During 2009 and 2010, the Commission worked intensively to give a better understanding of ILUC effects from increased biofuels use. Various Commission services carried out modelling and analytical exercises to investigate the nature of ILUC and provide quantitative estimates of the effects (additional cropland areas required and related GHG emissions): 1 http://faostat.fao.org/ ",

Global Trade and Environmental Impact Study of the EU Biofuels Mandate This work was carried out by the International Food Policy Institute (IFPRI) for the Directorate General for Trade (DG TRADE), and uses a global computable general equilibrium model (and extended and modified version of the existing MIRAGE model) to estimate the impact of EU biofuels policies. 2 2. Impacts of the EU biofuel target on agricultural markets and land use - a comparative modelling assessment This work, commissioned by the Directorate General of Agriculture (DG AGRI), was carried out by the JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS). It provides an outlook of agricultural production until 2020 with and without EU Biofuels policy, using the partial equilibrium models AGLINK-COSIMO (the model is developed by the OECD and FAO secretariats), ESIM (European Simulation Model), and CAPRI (specifically designed to analyse Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) measures and trade policies for agricultural products). 3 3. Indirect Land Use Change from increased biofuels demand. Comparison of models and results for marginal biofuels production from different feedstocks This study, carried out by the JRC Institute for Energy (JRC-IE) under request of the Directorate General for Climate (DG CLIMA), compares the ILUC results produced by different economic models for marginal increases in biofuel production from different feedstocks. 1.2. P URPOSE OF S TUDY The purpose of the present study is to implement and evaluate the methodology developed under the guide for the calculation of land carbon stocks in the biofuels as specified in Commission Decision of 10 June 2010 on guidelines for the calculation of land carbon stocks for the purpose of Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC (2010/335/EU) 4 .

For the distribution of the extra land a spatial allocation procedure was developed which fully integrates with other spatial data sets. Not part of this study are matters related to biodiversity and land degradation. Specifically excluded for allocating extra land demands are wetlands and peatlands. 1.3. JRC M ETHOD FOR C ALCULATING GHG E MISSIONS FROM ILUC Agro-economic models provide output of how much extra crop would be produced in different countries/world regions as a result of biofuels policy. Some models also predict the area of lands converted to cropping from pasture, forest, or natural land in each region, but the crucial question to calculate the corresponding GHG emissions is where ILUC occurs and how can the area be allocated spatially. For this purpose, the JRC Institute for the Environment and Sustainability (IES), with the support of the Institute of Energy (IE) is developing a methodology to trace on a map the extra agricultural land demand provided by agro-economic models. This report includes an estimation of the GHG emissions calculated taking as input data the results from studies using the MIRAGE model (IFPRI) and the AGLINK-COSIMO model (JRC-IPTS). With some minor implementations, the spatial allocation procedure and the GHG calculation methodology could be also applied in future to the results of other models, for example the marginal calculations reported in the JRC-IE modelling comparison exercise. The first task of this methodology is to locate geographically where the land use change predicted by models could occur, (also where the potential exists for avoiding land use change), on the basis of existing cropped areas, land availability and land suitability. Making use of the results and output of the agro-economic models, the study provides soil and land-use maps that identify regions where the expansion of biofuels production are most likely to occur. The second task of the present study is to convert the land use changes positioned in the previous steps into an estimate of GHG emissions resulting from the given change in biofuel demand. In case of land use/cover change, e.g. conversion of forest into cropland, carbon stocks and carbon dynamics in biomass and soil may change. Converting land cover types with high biomass and soil carbon stocks (e.g. forests) into cropland usually results in an immediate loss in biomass (removal of trees including roots) and a more gradual decline of carbon in the soil organic matter (SOM). The carbon released from biomass is emitted to the atmosphere as CO 2 . SOM contains both nitrogen and carbon and a decline of SOM releases both CO 2 and N 2 O. However, land use change may also cause an increase in soil carbon stock over the existing level (e.g. through changes in crop management) or in biomass (e.g. if grassland is cultivated with ",

These effects on carbon stocks in the soil and vegetation are accounted for in the carbon balance. There are at least three aspects to consider then: a) The first aspect of the GHG impact, for correct estimate of size and location of the indirect GHG emissions, is the characteristic of the land which would be converted to evaluate how much carbon would be released as a result. Therefore, global maps of soil organic carbon levels under different land uses need to be provided in order to estimate the effects of changes in soil carbon associated with scenarios of change in cropping systems under demand for biofuels. b) A second aspect is the calculation N 2 O emissions due to mineralization of N accompanying soil carbon stock decrease c) The thirds aspect is the evaluation of the CO 2 emissions which results from change in above and belowground biomass carbon stock due to changes in cropland area A schematic representation of the whole methodology is explained in Figure 1.

B ASELINE AND S CENARIO A SSUMPTIONS This study derived the change in land demand for 2020. JRC-IPTS baseline includes EU biofuel policies and the counterfactual scenario, which assumes the absence of all internal EU biofuel policies. The impact of higher palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia on oil palm area is not calculated by AGLINK-COSIMO. Regarding the EU biofuel policies, in the baseline scenario of AGLINK-COSIMO the energy share of biofuels is assumed to reach 8.5% in 2020, of which 7% consists of first generation and 1.5% second generation biofuels. Consistent with the RED, the energy provided by the latter is counted double for the purpose of meeting the 10% target. Starting from separate exogenous estimates of petrol and diesel consumption by the transport sector in 2020, the ethanol and biodiesel consumption in 2020 are each fixed at 8.5% of the total 2020 consumption of the corresponding fuel type. Second generation biofuel production is assumed to have no land use implications. Furthermore, it is assumed that tariffs are applied for EU imports of ethanol and biodiesel. 2.3. D ATA P REPARATION A considerable amount of effort went into the preparation of the spatial data layers. One task was to identify suitable thematic data to be used as reference in the computations. This was followed by investigating the data properties and identifying any deficiencies with respect to the completeness of the areas covered and thematic range of parameters included. The data retained were then harmonized for geographic and thematic properties. Consistency of the data was found to be a crucial component in the methodology applied, which uses spatial modelling to estimate the effect of ILUC. The changes from ILUC are at times very marginal and small aberrations, such as differences in coastlines between spatial layers, may override the ILUC effect. Where a small change is distributed across a large number of grid cells even the storage format of the data can be of significant to the result. Therefore, all spatial data layers used in the study were processed to fully comply with the reference specifications. ",

A 24-bit real number stores approx. 7 digits. The corresponding rounding error for the global land cover corresponds to 13.4 km 2 , not including the Antarctic. The grid size of 5 arc min. was chosen in response to the spatial characteristics of the various thematic layers to be integrated. o Soil The soil data, although distributed with a nominal resolution of 1km, are derived from data at scale 1:5,000,000 for some parts. This could reasonably be mapped to a raster size of 5 km for a mapping accuracy of \u00b10.5mm. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 24 o Climate The meteorological data defining the climate regions are mapped to different scales, ranging from 30 arc sec. (approx. 1km at Equator) to 10 arc min. (approx. 18.5 km at Equator) 14 . o Land Cover Land cover data from satellite imagery are available at various grid sizes. The products considered use a grid size of 300 m (GlobCover) or 1 km (GLC2000). The McGill M3 Cropland and Crops data set 15 from McGill University are available at 5 arc min. resolution. o Ancillary Data The global land suitability maps of the Food Insecurity, Poverty and Environment Global GIS Database (FGGD) are available as 5 arc min. layers through the FAO GeoNetwork site 16 . Other data used in support of the main thematic layers, such as the \u201c Land Use Systems of the World \u201d or the \u201c Global Agro-Ecological Zones \u201d are largely available at a grid size of 5 arc min. or lower resolution (0.5 deg.). Under those circumstances a raster size of 5 arc min. was considered a practical compromise when integrating the assorted data sets. \u2022 Common Land/Sea Mask To avoid arbitrary results in coastal areas all spatial layers were adjusted to a standard land/sea mask. The mask was generated from the global GISCO country coverage at scale 1:1,000,000. Coastal areas in the thematic data layers were revised by using a distance function to allocate layer attributes to the common mask. The importance of a common land/sea mask should not be underrated when performing computations with spatial layers as overlays. For example, the total ILUC area for the IFPRI scenarios is less than the size of Crete. Where changes are comparatively small the effect of misalignments is correspondingly high. \u2022 Area Computations The model for distributing crop land processes data in tabular format. To allow exchanging data between the model and the spatial data a layer with unique identifiers for each grid cell was generated. The IDs start at the top-left corner with 1 and count along the rows the bottom-right corner.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 25 the land/sea mask is applied to the grid IDs. For an analysis of the areas affected a layer with the surface area in km 2 was generated using a function of the GIS package Idrisi 17 . \u2022 File Size Management The size of a file in original resolution with global coverage can render processing the data a resource-intensive task whichever method of reducing the spatial resolution is used. The size of the file on a hard disk can be misleading when a storage format with compression is used. For example, the GlobCover data are store in a file of 300Mb in a GeoTIFF format using compression. For processing the data are decompressed, which leads to a file size of approx. 9Gb. Depending on the GIS package used such files may require dividing the area into 2 or more subsets for processing. The final layers are then produced by merging the processed sub-areas into a single layer. \u2022 Re-Scaling of Layer Geometry When a spatial layer is available at a resolution higher than 5 arc min. the geometry of the data needs to be adjusted to the standard parameters. For reducing the spatial resolution of the data several options are available: a) Grid sampling, majority (cid:214) single data layer class, value b) Aggregation (mean, max) (cid:214) single data layer value c) Proportional distribution (cid:214) multiple data layers class The grid sampling method is equivalent to systematic sampling of every n th grid in the original layer. The resulting information is therefore biased against classes with a low representation in the data. Similarly, sampling the majority can introduce a bias in the distribution of values in the data with reduced spatial resolution. Aggregating data to a statistical indicator is only applicable for data values of a continuous range. The method can lead to a loss of the dynamic range in the lower-resolution data. The third method maintains the information on the proportional distribution of the classes and thus also includes those with a low occurrence, but has higher requirements for processing and data storage. The first two methods lead to a single data layer to represent the original data. Those methods are relatively rapid to generate and provide considerable savings in data storage. Depending on the type of data to re-scale, either discrete classes or continuous values, some methods may not be applicable. All methods have in common that any information on the position of an attribute within the re-scaled grid cell is lost. For the project it was considered preferable to conserve the representation of classes in the LC layer rather than saving on processing time and storage requirements. Therefore, the method of aggregating to the proportional distribution of LC classes was chosen, where the spatial resolution of the original data was reduced to the project grid cell size 17 Clark Labs, Clark University 950 Main Street, Worcester MA 01610-1477 USA http://www.clarklabs.org/ ",

This results in a composite of 22 layers, each containing the relative occurrence of a class within 900 pixels of the original image for the GlobCover data. \u2022 Land Cover: Harmonization of Thematic Content The land cover classes specified by the RED, which could be converted to grow biofuels, are: (cid:131) Grassland, incl. degraded pastures (cid:131) Forest with <30% canopy cover (cid:131) Savannah and wooded savannah (cid:131) Degraded land The categories of the LC data had to be aligned to correspond to these types of potential biofuel areas. The legend contains a combination of distinct and mixed land cover types. For distinct classes an assignment to one of the LC classes of the RED is possible without particular difficulty. Assigning land cover types of the mixed classes is less obvious and to some degree problematic. The main obstruction in aligning the LC types of the image data were the classes containing a mixture of LC types for biofuel production. These mixed classes represent a typical mosaic of several LC types, which could not be separated in the images. Although a proportion of a single class within the mosaic is indicated this proportion at times refers to a group of LC types without further differentiation. The solution adopted was to proportionally repartition the LC types of the mixed classes to the biofuel LC types. A particular problem is generated by the threshold of a 30% forest cover to distinguish between areas on which could be converted to grow biofuels and forests, which cannot be converted to this purpose. Legend categories for GlobCover, GLC2000 and the LCCS use thresholds of 15% and 40% to classify forests in open or closed areas. According to the LCCS conversion table for GlobCover 18 all classes with >15% forest convert to forest. This does not lead to identifying a class of open forest with <30% cover. The extent of the convertible forest was therefore estimated by proportionally repartitioning the classes of the LC data for forest as for other categories of mixed uses or covers. 2.3.2. G LOB C OVER AND GLC2000 L EGEND A DAPTATION In order to simplify comparing GlobCover and GLC2000 data a table of correspondence between categories of the two data sets was created.

The correspondence is more detailed in the representation of forest cover in the datasets than for other types to improve the separation of forest types into open and closed fractions. Where no direct correspondence could be established the categories were merged until a reciprocated LC type could be formed. This procedure had to be applied in particular to categories of mixed LC types. It is still to some degree indistinct where a category contains ambiguity in the LC types it contains, i.e. were LC types are listed with an or condition.

The overall level of agreement between the re-classified GlobCover and GLC2000 data sets was 45.1%. The representation between comparable categories did generally not exceed 75%. It was best for \u201c Closed to open broadleaved evergreen or semi-deciduous forest \u201d (Category 21: 76.4/75.0%), followed by the merged category of \u201c Open and closed needleleaved evergreen forest \u201d (Category 24: 66.2/66.2%). The LC type \u201c Shrub \u201d (Category 30) in the GLC2000 data appears predominantly in forest categories in the GlobCover data. This confusion is more consequential than the confusion between shrub and herbaceous areas because forest areas should not be converted to produce biofuels, whilst areas covered by shrub or herbaceous vegetation are treated correspondingly. To some degree the spatial variation in the categories between the data sets can be attributed to the procedure of aggregating the data by using the central grid value. This will lead invariably to an amplification of any geometric differences between the spatial layers. Those variations become most notable in areas where the spatial distribution of the categories is patchy. To evaluate the spatial patter of the confusion of forest with other LC types between the two datasets the main mismatches of categories were mapped. The result is shown in Figure 6. ",

Shrubland in the GLC2000 data classified as needle-leaved tree cover in the GlobCover data is found primarily in areas of boreal forest in Northern America and Siberia. Other cross- classifications of forests relate to categories of mixed classes, in which forests could also be included. The conclusions drawn from the comparison of the GlobCover data with GLC2000 for mapping forest, and in particular areas of tree cover of <30%, are limited. Both datasets do not indicate the areas of open forest, which could be converted to produce biofuels directly. Categories containing a mixture or mosaic of LC types are inherently difficult to disaggregate because any LC type of the combination could be identified as an individual category in another dataset. There also appears to be some confusion between open forest and shrubland. The consequences of this divergence in classification may not be of great consequence where a high proportion of the open forest with 15-40% tree cover falls into the category of <30% tree cover. The differences in classifying shrubland and areas of herbaceous vegetation are considered largely inconsequential to the project because both can in principal be converted to produce biofuel. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 31 As a practical and still conservative solution to the problem of identifying areas with forest <30% cover it was decided to allocate 60% of the open forest classes to forest with <30% cover and 40% to forest with >=30% cover. A category of shrubland was included as a separate category in the LC data set and not merged with herbaceous vegetation to form a category of \u201c Savannah and wooded savannah \u201d. Areas of wetland were also identified as separate categories not specifically defined for the conversion to biofuel. The potential changes in organic carbon on wetlands following a transformation of land cover or use are being treated by IPCC using separate conversion factors for example for changes in soil organic carbon. These variations could only be considered by allowing a separate treatment of wetlands.

M C G ILL M3-C ROPLAND AND C ROP D ATA An inconvenience of the GlobCover data when looking at European agriculture is that the identification of cropland is limited to areas below approx. 57 deg N. This includes most agricultural areas in the Baltic states, but only the coastal areas in Sweden are covered and completely omitted are croplands in Finland. Without additional data on the presence of cropland in those areas the GlobCover data would be of only limited use. For reasons of compatibility with other applications, such as deposition, the category \u201c Cropland \u201d of the biofuel classification scheme was substituted by data from McGill M3-Cropland data sets. The data correspond to the spatial characteristics of the project dataset and were only adjusted to the land/sea overlay. However, the data relate to conditions of the year 2000 rather than 2006. This difference in time was considered acceptable because no extensive changes in the occurrence of cropland or pastures over the period of 6 years were expected. The global area under cropland extracted from the McGill M3-Cropland layer is 15.1 mil. km 2 . The area extracted from the re-classified GlobCover data is 17.4 mil. km 2 . This figure is just outside the range given for the M3-Cropland data for a 90% confident level (17.1 mil. km 2 ). This difference of 15% could probably be accepted if one takes into consideration that the users\u2019 accuracy (percentage of land classified as a category actually belongs to that category) for the 3 categories of croplands of the GlobCover data ranges from 60.9 to 84.4% 19 . However, the differences may be unevenly distributed in space and thus lead to significantly conflicting identification of areas which could be converted to grow biofuel. The difference in the proportion attributed to croplands between the McGill M3 data and the corresponding category of the re-classified GlobCover data has been calculated for the spatial layers and are shown in Figure 7. 19 This figure for accuracy is derived for the category containing a single LUC type. When taking categories with mixed LUC types into account to compute the overall accuracy for a single LUC category the figure has to be adjusted. For example, from Table 8 in the GlobCover report for the combined categories of croplands (Categories 10+11+14) the users accuracy is computed as 84.9% and the producers\u2019 accuracy (percentage of land of a category classified as that category) as 44.2%. Category 10 (Cultivated and managed areas) does not occur in the spatial layer. It appears to have been included in Category 14 (Rainfed croplands). ",

To assess that the disparity was not caused by the re- classification procedure of the GlobCover data the category containing only herbaceous vegetation (Class 140) was also compared to the McGill M3-Pasture layer. Also for those data the regional differences were as prevalent as for the re-classified data. When comparing the distribution of the differences for cropland to those for grassland an inverse trend in the identification in the GlobCover data by region is notable (see also Figure 7). Grassland in northern America is defined as cropland in the M3 data while for southern America the inverse relationship is found. A similar trend can be noted for eastern Asia. Another condition leading to the differences is the uncertainty in the separation of pastures from shrubland. This confusion dominates the disparity in eastern parts of North America and Africa. The herbaceous vegetation in central Asia and Australia is generally classified as sparse vegetation in the GlobCover data. Also for this LC type the characteristics separating one category from the other fluctuate. It is not clear whether the differences between the data sets can at least in part be attributed to variations in the definition of pasture and grassland. The disparity in the distribution of croplands and the likely confusion of cropland with pastures or shrubland poses a problem to the identification of the LC type for the application of the IPCC Tier 1 GHG coefficients.

M ERGING LC L AYERS WITH M3-C ROPLAND AND M3- C ROPS D ATA The statistical basis of the M3-Cropland and Crops Data suggests merging the M3 data with the GlobCover data. For all other LC classes GlobCover data were used. Following the large disparities in the location of pastures and grasslands the GlobCover grassland layer was retained and not replaced with the McGill M3-Pasture data. The LC types identified in the Renewable Energy Directive are more generalized than the classes used in the economic models. The output from IFPRI-MIRAGE distinguishes the biofuel LC types, but models the development of changes for the following crops and crop groups: (cid:131) maize (cid:131) wheat (cid:131) rice (cid:131) sugar crops (cid:131) oilseed crops (cid:131) vegetables and fruit (cid:131) other crops Information on the distribution of those crops is not available in the satellite-based LC products. The McGill M3-Crops Data layers provide an estimate of the spatial distribution of 175 crops based on FAO statistical data. Contrary to the McGill M3- Cropland data and other sources on LC the data for individual crops contains the proportion of harvested area instead of surface area. The harvested area takes into account multiple crops per year, which may be of the same or following a system of crop rotation. While the use of harvested area retains the proportion for crop yields when computed from production figures the change in LC is based on the surface area the crops use. Therefore, the harvested area of the McGill M3-Crops Data is expressed as surface area by adjusting the data for multiple cropping systems. The number of crops grown on an area per calendar year is estimated as: Harvests of No AREA AREA surface harvested _ _ \u00d7 = where AREA harvested represented by the McGill M3-Crops Data; AREA surface from McGill M3-Cropland layer. Hence, for the number of harvests the ratio AREA harvested / AREA surface is used. While the number of harvests on a given location can only be an integer value the ratio figure is used because not all areas within a grid cell may follow the same crop system. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 38 When it is known that no more than 2 crops are grown on a field within a year the portion of single and double cropping can be computed. In places where next to single cropping systems there also exist systems with 2 or 3 crops, the proportion cannot be computed without ambiguity. One approach to better define the number of crops in an area would be to use the occurrence of crops in multiple cropping systems. The maximum proportion of the harvested areas of crops and crop groups within a grid cell of the M3-Crops Data set is given in Table 12.

The proportion of the harvested area of all crop groups indicates that at least triple cropping systems are practiced in some regions. Within the cereal group, the crop most widely used in multiple cropping systems is rice (1.930) while the occurrence of wheat is relatively low (1.165). In the procedure applied to estimate the crop surface area from the harvested area the information on the maximum proportion of a crop or crop group indicating the presence in multiple cropping systems was not used. Apart from the complexity in the computations it was found that the areas of the McGill M3-Crops Data did not total the surface area of the McGill M3-Cropland in many regions. This discrepancy was attributed to a lack of the harvested areas of crops being reported in the statistical data, but also to areas of fallow land. The extent of missing crop areas or fallow land could be estimated when the surface area of the cropland exceeded the harvested area of all crop groups. Where the harvested area exceeds the cropland the extent of non-reported crops or fallow land could not be defined from the data. The surface area of crop groups and crops was therefore computed depending on the difference between the harvested area and the cropland surface area as follows: ",

The partial use of individual crops, as for cereals, necessitates the creation of a complement class to fully cover the group of crops, as in the case of cereals. The creation of another complement group ( G_OtherLand ) was found to be needed to allow for differences between the sum of the area of crops and the cropland area. In the preparation of the data for the spatial dispersion model the various crops and groups were arranged to sum to the total of the cropland area.

This procedure establishes spatial coherence between the cropland and the crop surface areas, but also simplifies the integration of the M3 data into the GlobCover layers. Only the cropland layer needs to be merged, because the layers for individual crops are already harmonized with the M3 cropland layer. Merging the M3-Cropland data with the GlobCover data is achieved by substituting the cropland layer of the re-classified GlobCover data with the M3-Cropland layer. The proportions are adjusted to fully cover an area with LC types and keeping the M3 layer data constant, as presented in the equation: Cropland GC GC Cropland M adj M LUC LUCLUC LUC _ 3 _ 3 1 \u2212 \u2212 = \u2211 \u2212 where LC M3_Adjusted LC type proportion adjusted for McGill M3 cropland LC M3_Cropland McGill M3-Cropland proportion LC GC LC cover type proportion in GlobCover data LC GC_Cropland Cropland proportion in GlobCover data In land areas without data the proportions of the LC classes were estimated based on the distribution found in the neighbouring areas using an inverse distance function. This step ensures that all land areas are covered with data. The procedure was extended to include inland water surfaces, which were not part of the original M3 data. The areas are accounted for in the class \u201c Other Land \u201d of the GlobCover layers. Because the spatial re-sampling of the various thematic layers can introduce shifts in the position of a grid cell the LC types \u201c Settlements \u201d and \u201c Other Land \u201d are used as defined in the GlobCover data and were excluded from the spatial allocation procedure. The proportions of the LC types and crops within a grid cell of the raster data were transferred from the spatial layers to a database format. (Tables BASE_LCSA and BASE_CROPS). These tables form the base data from which the spatial distribution of the crops is modelled in response to changes coming from the economic models. 2.3.5.

Default reference values are defined for mineral soils only and the topsoil layer (0-30 cm). The reference values are defined for soil typologies following the classification schemes of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil taxonomy and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB). The HWSD provides for the primary soil typological units of a mapping unit the soil class according to WRB. For sub-units soil classes according to FAO74 or FAO90 20 are recorded in the database. These have to be mapped to the classes of the IPCC reference values using a separate procedure. \u2022 Harmonized World Soil Database Soil data were extracted from the Harmonized World Soil Database V1.1 as released in March, 2009. It is a compilation of several global and regional soil databases to a standard structure and harmonized thematic content. The principal structure of the HWSD is depicted in Figure 10.

In the HWSD a soil mapping unit is composed of up to 10 typological units, all with different soil properties. SMUs and STUs are linked by a table which also contains the dominant STU in an SMU (HWSD_SMU). Meta-data is provided by a number of dictionary tables. In a deviation from the data model used for the Soil Geographic Database of Eurasia (SGDBE) the HWSD does not contain a separate table for the STUs.

This condition makes mapping the complete range of attributes characterizing a mapping unit a non-trivial task. One approach to the problem is to link only the attributes of the dominant STU, as identified in the HWSD_SMU, to the spatial layer. Mapping all data pertaining to an SMU can be achieved for measured data by computing a weighted average for the area. For classified data a translation of the table data into a spatial database requires generating 10 spatial layers for each of the class attributes. This can considerably increase storage requirements of the spatial data. \u2022 Assigning IPCC Soil Types Several processing steps and data adjustments were taken to assign the mapping units to an IPCC soil type with a default reference value. o Separation of Soil from \u201cOther Areas\u201d \u201cOther Areas\u201d are all non-soil areas, such as rock outcrops, glaciers, sand dunes or inland water surfaces. The separation of soils from other areas is coded in the database in more than one table. Most explicitly areas of soils are given for the typological units through the field [HWSD_DATA.ISSOIL]. However, this information does not uniformly identify the soils. In 5 instances fibric Histolos ( Hfs ) were also classified as non-soil. Soils could also be separated from non- soils by using the dictionary table SU_SYMBOL linked to the HWSD_SMU table. For reasons which could not be established some typological units were declared non-soils, in particular as sand dunes and rocky outcrops. An overview of the entries in the field [HWSD_SMU.SYMBOL] with the field [HWSD_DATA.ISSOIL] gave the combinations given in Table 13. ",

All cases concern Histosols and the reason for their classification as non-soil in the [HWSD_DATA.ISSOIL] field is not evident. Also found were 9 cases of inconsistent classifications with respect to soil / non- soil between the FAO 85 and the FAO90 data. All cases relate to entries indicating \u201c No data \u201d in the FAO 85 field, while the FAO 90 field indicates a soil type (8 for \u201c ATa \u201d and 1 for \u201c ATc \u201d).

There were 21 codes in the dictionary table without correspondence in the data table. There were also two codes (\u201c Glu \u201d, 1 case and \u201c NI \u201d, 12 cases) in the data table without corresponding entries in the dictionary table. The entry \u201c Glu \u201d is most likely a typing error for \u201c Umbric Gleysols \u201d, for which the code is \u201c GLu \u201d. The differences in coding non-soil surfaces between the 4 dictionary tables together with the confusion of coding the condition in the data table does not allow to establish full data integrity between the data and the dictionary tables. For this end the data would have to be modified. Instead, a more coherent approach is to establish a link using the [CODE] field. This approach did not result in the inconsistencies in linking data to the dictionaries described above. \u2022 Spatial Representation of Soil Types The IPCC Tier 1 soil categories for default values are defined using the USDA soil taxonomy and the WRB classification schemes.

The areas concerned were considered of no consequence to the analysis and no substitute soil types were introduced for the land areas. o Classification of Sandy Soils The first rule identifying sandy soils (Sand content >70% and Clay content <8%) could by applied directly to the data. In the dataset 1,692 mapping units were classified as sandy soils. The simple query procedure was possible because the database does not contain entries with empty records for texture 21 . In case of empty field entries the condition defined by the query would not have been met for those fields and the area attributed to one of the other soil classes. For the condition set to identify sandy soils the complete set of typological units for the mapping units was also used to allow an evaluation of the differences in the methodology. When using a weighted texture analysis 942 mapping units are classified as sandy soils. This constitutes quite a marked difference in the number of mapping units classified as sandy soils and demonstrates that taking the weighted mean of all typological units to characterize a mapping unit can introduce an element of bias to the distribution of a soil property, although the weighted value better represents the mapping unit. Since all other conditions of the classification scheme act on the categorical parameters (soil type), for which 21 Only one mapping unit with an organic soil (HSf) was found without soil texture data. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 48 mathematical methods of interpolating between values are not applicable the mapping units were classified according to the properties of the dominant soil type also to identify sandy soils. Not included in the category of sandy soils were sand dunes. Those areas not classified as soils and in the majority of cases no soil types are attached to the typological units in the database. However, of the 48 typological units recorded as sand dunes, for 20 units a soil type was also recorded. Of those 9 cases had a value of <70% (between 39 and 47%) recorded for the sand texture property. The typological units where a soil type was recorded were included in the query to define sandy soils, while the units without soil type information were treated as sand dunes. The re-classification used the soil class Arenosol to identify sandy soils rather than the texture conditions. This approach was preferred to using the conditions to be consistent in the methodology. Using conditions to define sandy soils could lead to excluding from the result typological units classified as Arenosols, but with a lower sand fraction or higher clay fraction. Because no other conditions are set in the classification scheme those soils could be excluded from being classified. The outcome depends on the implementation of how \u201cLow Activity Clay Soils\u201d are identified. Adhering strictly to the classification scheme LAC soils cover the areas not defined by any other soil type. Therefore, any areas of Arenosol would end in this category. In practice this involves removing all areas of non-soil first since the database also contains areas of rock, water, glaciers, etc. o Classification of Wetland, Volcanic, Spodic, LAC and HAC Soils A wetland soil was the dominant typological unit for 821 mapping units. Mapping Unit 31531 uses \u201c Gl \u201d instead of \u201c GL \u201d as the symbol for Gleysols, which has to be considered when defining the query conditions. Classified as volcanic soils were 169 mapping units and 429 were classified as spodic soils. The separation of low-activity clay (LAC) soils from high-activity clay (HAC) soils was performed based on the soil types specified in the IPCC. o Treatment of Anthrosols A separate treatment not specified in the IPCC procedures had to be applied to 124 cases where an Anthrosol was given for the dominant typological unit. These soils are defined by their anthropogenic influence rather than a soil property and may occur in any of the other classes. According to the recommendations of the SINFO study (Baruth et al ., 2006) the 18 cases of aric Anthrosols ( ATa ) are converted to aric Regosols ( RGai ) and 104 cases of cumulic Anthrosols ( ATc ) were converted to terric Anthrosols ( ATtr ) in WRB98. The latter are regularly found in areas of wetland soils or of acid and unfertile soils (Driessen et al ., 2001). As a consequence all Anthrosols were classified as HAC soils. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 49 Also classified were areas of organic soils and those where no soils are present. For organic soils no default values are defined by IPCC. Under Tier 1 gaseous emissions from those areas are quantified using measurements methods instead of changes in carbon content. \u2022 Mapping IPCC Tier 1 Soil Types The IPCC soil types for SOC default values for mineral soils under native vegetation could be mapped directly to the spatial layer by using the dominant STU. Using only the information of the dominant STU for an SMU greatly simplifies data processing. It allows generating a single spatial layers for regardless of the value type of the soil property and without the need of computing aereal weights or other methods of aggregating properties. The advantages in data management are balanced by reduced information content and susceptibility for introducing bias in the data. When a soil property is generally present as a sub-dominant typological unit the use of only the properties of the dominant unit introduces a bias against the representation of the sub-dominant soil type. Although demanding a much more involved processing task using the information of all STUs of the HWSD could produce a more detailed result. The distribution of soils according to the IPCC classification scheme applied to the dominant typological unit of the HWSD is presented in Figure 12 ",

Those areas are mainly located in desert areas, such as the Sahara, and the Sinai Peninsula. Some areas are also not considered soils, such as glaciers, snow fields or bare rock. A specific condition is presented by sealed surfaces or urban areas. For larger urban areas the soil database does not contain information of the soil type. In the course of the project those areas were processed as found in the database. The total area defined as land in the spatial layer differs from the total land area because smaller islands are not included at the resolution of the spatial data layer. \u2022 Mapping IPCC Default Reference Values of SOC Stocks The Tier 1 approach of IPCC for estimating changes in carbon emissions from mineral soils is based on defining default reference values of SOC stocks under natural vegetation for specific soil types and depending on climatic zones. The default reference values are defined for the combination of 9 soil types and 6 climatic zones. Of the 54 possible combinations a default value is defined for 39 cases. For the 15 combinations without a default value it is assumed that the combination does not exists or is sufficiently rare to define a default value. When using the IPCC soil type layer developed from the HWSD data and overlaying the climate zones combinations are found for which no default values are specified. The areas are comparatively small, as shown in Figure 13. ",

Larger SMU are found in Canada and Brazil. To include the areas in the GHG estimation suitable default values were estimated from the topsoil SOC stock developed from the HWSD. A layer of native vegetation was generated from the GlobCover and GLC2000 data by integrating the classes of forest, grassland, shrub, sparse and wetlands to represent native vegetation. In the combination of classes the original classification scheme was used. Classes containing mosaics were not used when they contained cropland, urban areas or other areas. Only those areas were used in the analysis for which the classes representing native vegetation exceeded a threshold of cell coverage. The SOC stock data were processed in the database for SMUs using all STUs. The SMU SOC stock values were computed by integrating the area-weighted values of the STUs. The 5 arc min. layer of SOC stock was generated using two different methods of aggregating the data to the layer resolution: (cid:131) The SOC value is assigned directly to the SMU of the re-sampled 5 arc min. raster reference value.

Other soil/climate combinations showed distinctly lower variances with a tendency for lower values in the SOC layer of the re-sampled SMU for sandy soils and higher values for volcanic soils. Also investigated was the influence of the proportion of native vegetation in a grid cell. Thresholds of 90 and 95% were used to accept a cell in the analysis. For both LC layers the mean SOC stocks generally increased with a higher portion of native vegetation in the cell. However, the changes were, however, small and did not exceed 4 kg for mineral soil. A reverse trend was found on wetland soils, where the mean SOC stocks decreased with an increase in native vegetation cover. This tendency was present for both the GlobCover and the GLC2000 data. The IPCC SOC default values were compared to the values of the HWSD using GLC2000 data to specify areas of native vegetation with a coverage of >95% of a grid cell. The GLC2000 data was given preference over GlobCover data because the data were used in the preparation of the HWSD. A difference in the mean SOC stock values in the soil database between forest and herbaceous cover was evaluated only for the GLC2000 data. For a native vegetation coverage of >95% the SOC value for soils under herbaceous cover was lower than under trees in 50 soil/climate combinations, while it was higher under herbaceous vegetation cover for 23 combinations. The comparison between the IPCC default values and the SOC values of the soil/climate layer using GLC2000 to define forest and herbaceous vegetation was performed with a vegetation coverage minimum of 95% instead of 99%. The lower threshold was used because for a limited number of classes the sample size was at times too small, leading to spurious results. Given the spatially aligned differences in SOC stocks between soils under forest and grassland the maximum value for either LC type was extracted.

Only for volcanic soils does the soil/climate data provide generally higher estimates than IPCC for default values. The differences between the data merits a more in-depth investigation, in particular the delineation of zones with native vegetation. It would also be preferable to include data from measured soil profiles in the analysis. However, such a study was outside the scope of this work. The consequences of the differences on estimating emissions of carbon from the soil depend on the distribution of the soils.

Conversely, the SOC stock values from the soil/climate layer are mainly higher for LAC soils than the IPCC default values. For further processing of the soil data the IPCC default values were used where available and the values extracted from the soil/climate layer for combinations for which no default values were defined. The areas covered by the substitute values are very limited, as shown in Figure 13. Although the method of estimating carbon emissions from peat is fundamentally different in the IPCC Tier 1 approach from estimating carbon emissions from mineral soils the average SOC stock values for organic soils were also extracted from the soil/climate layer.

Including PET in the classification scheme separates classification from other commonly used classification systems, such as the system from K\u00f6ppen-Geiger (Peel, et al ., 2007). The classification presented as \u201c Figure 3A.5.1 Delineation of major climate zones, updated from the 1996 IPCC Guidelines \u201d (IPCC, 2006) could not be accessed in electronic form as a spatial layer and alternative sources of the data had to be used. The classification scheme applied by IPCC resembles the delineation of life zones developed by Holdridge (1947). A dataset of the life zones was compiled by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analyses (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria (Leemans, 1990) and is available e.g. as the GNV5 dataset through the UNEP GRID web-site 22 or the 22 http://www.grid.unep.ch/data/summary.php?dataid=GNV5&category=biosphere&dataurl=http://www.gri ",

Most similar to the IPCC classification appears the version where the original classes were aggregated with Olson's ecosystem classes. One of the main disadvantages of using any similar existing datasets is the lack of the base data, to which the classification scheme was applied. This will inevitably lead to inconsistencies when integrating the data in modelling tasks. Furthermore, the data from Leemans is available at 30 arc min. grid spacing, while the other layers are generated at 5 arc min. grid spacing. The IPCC classification scheme was therefore applied to an independently developed set of base data layers. Climatic information on temperature and precipitation was provided by the 5 arc min dataset Version 1.4 24 from the WorldClim project (Hijmans et al ., 2005). The data summarized climatic conditions between the years of 1950 to 2000. In the absence of a monthly mean temperature the parameter was computed from the minimum and maximum temperatures. The elevation data was taken from the same source for reasons of consistency with the climate parameters. PET is not readily available in the dataset. A layer has been computed following two different approaches. \u2022 PET Modelled for Mean Daily Temperature A simple model for PET using as temperature input only the mean daily temperature was developed for modelling rainfall runoff by Oudin et al.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 61 One reason for the difference in the boreal zone could be that the formula for PET is only applicable for conditions where T a + 5 > 0 or else PE T is set to 0.

It was found that this condition did not change the delineation of the condition except for central Greenland, where the \u201c Polar Dry \u201d zone could have been classified as \u201c Polar Moist \u201d.

The definition of the ecological zones is described in Table 4.1 (IPCC, 2006). While in Table 4.1 reference is made to Climate Regions the domain criteria cited are not those used in the classification scheme for default climate regions (Figure 3A.5.2, IPCC (2006)) and are not exclusive. In the table the subtropical domain is equated with the warm temperate climate region and the temperate domain with the cool temperate region. The defining criterion is the number of months ( \u2203 8)with a mean temperature > 10\u00b0C. For the delineation of the default Climate Regions a criterion of Mean Annual Temperature > 10 is specified without the additional criterion on the duration. The criteria defining ecological zones are not as strictly defined as those used to delineate the default Climate Regions. An example is the criterion used to separate dry from semi-arid zones, where an area could belong to both zones. The extent of the ecological zones also depends on the order in which the criteria are applied to a climate region. As a consequence, the layer of default Climate Regions cannot be further detailed to result in a layer of Ecological Zones without introducing inconsistencies. To maintain compatibility with the Climate Region map a spatial layer of Ecological Zones was generated with the minimum of modifications.

This can be a result of the processing applied, because arid zones are defined before semi-arid and dry zones, the absence of a vegetation layer as a criterion or the climatic data used. This leads to the Tibetan high plateau being classified as polar (all months < 10\u00b0C). The extent of the climate regions and ecological zones depend to a large degree on the base data used, but also on the particularities of the processing applied.

The indicator can be Boolean (x or -) or use a threshold value, as for fertilizer application rates. The two exclusive sets of conditions are combined by an OR function to identify the area for a LMS type. Several ancillary data sources were used as proxy to define the LMS factors and their spatial distribution. o Project LC The basic information on the distribution of the biofuel land use and cover types are taken from the corresponding thematic layers. The only exception is the layer for set-aside. Set-aside or fallow land comes in various forms and the McGill M3 source data does not include set-aside or fallow land. In an approximation the set-aside layer was computed as the difference of the sum of all crop surface areas and the total cropland area. The crop surface area is the proportion of a crop within a grid cell derived from the harvested area corrected for multiple cropping. o FAO / IIASA LADA Data from the Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands project were mainly used to identify the grazing intensity from the thematic layer of Land Use Systems of the World . The data are available in raster format and 5 arc min. grid size with a single attribute for each grid cell. o FAO AQUASTAT From FAO\u2019s Aquastat 30 information system the global map of irrigation areas was used in Version 4.0.1 (Siebert, et al ., 2007). The data were integrated into the LADA layer in the form of 3 classes of irrigation intensity.

Comparable data have become available as the CGIAR-CSI Global-Aridity and Global-PET Database (Trabucco & Zomer, 2009) from the Consortium for Spatial 30 ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/aglw/aquastat/gmia_v4_0_1_pct_asc.zip ",

The general function of the spatial allocation procedure is to distribute the marginal cropland resulting from the implementation of different biofuel policy scenarios, according to the results of the economic models run at regional level. The land is allocated over either existing or new cropland, given the LC and crop distribution in the reference layers. Allocation criteria are the land suitability for agriculture and the distance from cropland. The spatial allocation of agricultural land demand is performed a two step process: o Spatial analysis: database creation, combining different data sources into a single database. o Simulation: based on cropland demands from agro-economic models. Details on the steps of the spatial allocation and specific considerations are presented hereafter. 3.1.

S PATIAL A LLOCATION P ROCESS The spatial allocation is performed by region defined in the economic models, with each region being processed independently from the other. Within a region, through the allocation process data are downscaled to the country and then to the grid cells of the spatial layer. The spatial allocation process distinguishes three processes to perform the spatial distribution of the cropland demand given by economic model: a) For each crop the marginal economic demand is split in four buckets according to the trends extracted from MODIS time series. Those buckets correspond to the 4 land cover used in the Winrock study (EPA, 2009), which are Forest, Shruband, Savannah and Grassland. b) The grid cells candidate for cropland expansion are selected using filters on the MODIS Land Cover classes (to fit with the split in A), on the suitability classes in term of soil and climate provided by IIASA (Fisher, 2002) and on the distance to the cropland class of the Biofuel LUC map at the year of reference. c) The four buckets of process A are distributed in the grid cells selected by B. When the demand is negative the crop acreage is decreased and when the demand is positive the crop acreage is increased. An adjustment of the non cropland classes of the JRC Land Cover classification is also performed. A schematic overview of the three processing steps of the spatial allocation process are presented in Figure 23. ",

This list of cells is then transmitted to the distribution process which performs the distribution of the economic demand to the candidate cells. 3.4. F ILTERING D ATA WITH MODIS L AND C OVER T YPOLOGY The MODIS land cover time series allow to compare the land cover distribution in the world for the years between 2001 and 2004. Using this comparison it is possible to extract some trends for the future. This process has been described (EPA, 2009) and the JRC proposes to partially use it in the current study. Basically, it indicates how much of the new cropland is supposed to be taken from the classes Forest, Grassland, Savannah or Shrubland of the MODIS classification if the trends observed between 2001 and 2004 are also followed in the future. The procedure is covered in detail in 3.4 Filtering Data with MODIS Land Cover Typology. o Suitability Criteria One of the drivers for the land allocation process is the suitability of the land for agriculture. This suitability indicates how much the soil and climate characteristics are favourable or unfavourable for agriculture. This suitability can be defined for each crop and gives information on the likelihood of cropland expansion in the different areas according to the type of soil and the climate of the region. o Distance Criteria The grid cells are ranked according to their proximity to the current cropland areas. The land allocation process gives a priority to the cells at a short distance from those areas already devoted to agriculture but it can also handle the apparition of new spots for agriculture. The balance between the constraint of distance and the constraint of suitability can be adjusted with the customization of the distribution functions. o Random Factor A random variable has been introduced to spread out, in some contexts, the land expansion uniformly between areas of equal land suitability and equal distance to cropland.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 78 3.5. C ROPLAND D ISTRIBUTION The cropland distribution process assigns the cropland demand (derived from the economic models) to the cells selected according to a customizable 3-step process. The first step of the process decreases the acreage of the crops with a negative marginal demand, the second step allocates crops with a positive marginal demand on land released by step one and the third step allocates the remaining cropland demand in new agricultural land. In parallel to the increase of cropland areas a decrease of other types of land cover is performed. o Cropland Decrease In case of negative marginal cropland demand the land allocation process decreases the share of cropland in the cells of the region affected by this cropland withdrawal. This decrease is performed homogenously across all the cells of the region, no specific driver parameters are used for this decrease. o Cropland Increase All the crops with a positive marginal demand are distributed through a unique process: The application checks the suitability for each crop in the region and starts the land distribution with the crop(s). The areas where land expansion occurs are selected by order of priority, as defined before. When two or more crops are equal candidates for crop expansion in the same cell, with the same level of suitability for each crop, then the land available in the cell is equally shared between the crops. o Crop Substitution Where marginal cropland demand is negative for some crops and positive for other crops then crop substitution takes place. The crop substitution is simply a decrease in the acreage of some crops followed, in the same cell, by a refill of the land released, i.e. an increase in the acreage of other crops. The land expansion for crop with a positive land demand always starts in these areas released from crops with negative land demand. The cropland expansion in new areas occurs only when land substitution possibilities are exhausted. o Land Cover Adjustment If cropland expansion occurs in a cell, the corresponding amount of hectares must be released from other land covers present in the cells. MODIS time series could, in theory, gives indication about the type of land cover that is converted. As already mentioned, in ENSUS (2009) there are some discrepancies between the MODIS dataset and the statistics provided by FAO. Therefore, to limit the impact of these differences the MODIS time series data are only used to identify areas of change relative to cropland. The share of different land cover classes ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 79 converted to cropland is not deduced directly from the MODIS time series trends. As an alternative, the land allocation model adopts a conservative strategy: the decrease is performed in a way that the shares between the land covers present in the cell and eligible for cropland substitution remains constant (see illustration Figure 24 Figure 24: 3,000 ha of Cropland Expansion Homogeneously Distributed between Forest and Savannah in a 10,000 ha Area 3.6. G ENERAL C OMMENTS ON S PATIAL A LLOCATION P ROCEDURE It is important to point out some drawbacks of the process in order to avoid any confusion on the scope and the use of the results coming from the spatial allocation procedure. Results obtained from the simulation run by the model should not be taken as a true picture of what will be the reality of future cropland distribution in the world: this is beyond the capabilities of any global model at present. Rather, the model provides a best-estimate of the typical areas which would be affected, which is particularly important for the subsequent calculations of the associated soils emissions (compared to assuming all land types are affected equally, or some other gross simplification). Modelling means making assumptions, simplifying and making compromises between the complexity of the model, the computing time and the availability of the data. 50% Forest 25% Savanna 20% Artificial 5% Cropland 30% Forest 15% Savanna 20% Artificial 35% Cropland Before cropland expansion After cropland expansion ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 80 o Remarks on Data Availability The model presented in this document distributes the cropland using only biophysical criteria as drivers. It means that some very important constraints such as socio-economic criteria are not taken into account. This is due to the lack of data on this issue, for instance global dataset on the land costs or production costs are not available at 5 arc min. spatial resolution. However, some socio-economic criteria are embedded in the agro-economic model providing the crop demand for the future, thus they impact indirectly the land allocation process at macro level. o Difficulties of Calibration Due to the lack of data, and more specifically the lack of time series in term of land cover, the calibration of the model is difficult. Some trends have been extracted from the MODIS land cover between 2001 to 2004 but the time frame is not long enough to process a calibration based on the comparison between the result of the model and an observed situation for a date posterior to 2004. o Data Uncertainty Within the framework of the ILUC estimates there is significant uncertainty and of course it follows that there is uncertainty present in the spatial allocation procedure of extra cropland demand. Each input data source comes with its own inaccuracy that can be difficult to evaluate. This apples not only to the output of agro-economic models but also for the soil, climate and land cover database used as the main drivers for cropland expansion. Regarding uncertainties in land cover data, Table 20 presents the total amount of hectares allocated to cropland in the world according to different datasets. It highlights the important discrepancies between the datasets even if it only shows global values. Obviously, the spatial distribution of cropland in the world is also prone to strong uncertainties.

This variation is then applied to carbon stock of the baseline situation. The approach saves modelling conditions for 2020 and assumes that the C emissions from the expansion in cropland in 2020 are not significantly different from those that would be estimated based on the distribution of crops in the base data. Although the transfer of changes in area rather than total values removes some of the differences between the economic model and the project data some other aspects of data consistency remain. There some problematic areas in the layers of national boundaries when defining the regions. For example, overseas areas are assigned to the region of the administering country and not to the economies of immediately neighbouring regions. Additionally, no clear attribution to a region can be made for areas under dispute. Since the thematic layers all contain data for those areas the transfer of regional trends from the economic model has to account for those areas. One option is to mask all areas concerned, another to assume no change between the reference and the scenario results. The latter option has been chosen for estimating C stock changes in the soil because the approach does not change the global values for SOC stocks. ",

The guidelines outline: \u201c Where soil C is lost through oxidation as a result of land-use change \u2026, this loss will be accompanied by a simultaneous mineralisation of N.

According to IPCC (2006) the opposite process to mineralization, whereby inorganic N is sequestered into newly formed SOM, is not taken account of in the calculation of the mineralization N source. This is because of the different dynamics of SOM decomposition and formation, and also because reduced tillage in some circumstances can increase both SOM and N 2 O emission. The IPCC (2006) Tier 2 approach - taking into account different land uses/covers and disaggregated C:N ratios - was applied to calculate the amount of mineralized N resulting from loss of soil organic carbon.

The rainy season(s) can be taken as the period(s) when rainfall > 0.5 * Pan Evaporation.

LUC as a consequence of the RED (LUCRED) is the difference in land use/cover in a scenario with respect to the reference case, regardless of the direction of change (e.g cropland to forest or forest to cropland). The spatially allocated change in land use/cover in 2020 is compared with the land use/cover at the same place in the year 2000 (LU2000). Following the approach outlined in IPCC (2006) and Carre et al .

It is defined that annualized emissions from carbon stock changes caused by land-use change, shall be calculated by dividing total emissions equally over 20 years, despite the fact that the major part of CO 2 /GHG emissions from biomass occur at the moment of the LUC (in any case in a very short period), whereas emissions from soil occur over a longer period. Moreover, the current approach only covers CO 2 emissions/removal by the relevant pools, and not the non-CO 2 GHG emissions which are often associated with land conversions (i.e. land conversion technology may involve burning of the existing biomass, which leads to non-CO 2 emissions). As explained in the previous chapters, the spatial allocation procedure distinguishes 7 agricultural classes and 8 other land use/cover classes. In this context it is important to note the issue of temporal reference. The initial land use/cover data set describes the situation in the year 2000. When considering carbon stock changes associated with land use/cover changes, the RED relies on the methods described in Carre et al . (2009), which is based on the IPCC Tier 1 approach. Concerning the temporal issue in land use/cover changes it is stated that: \u201c\u2026lands might have experienced several successive uses or cover changes before it is finally converted to a biofuel crop. In this case, initial land use in rapport with a reference time or period has to be considered (i.e. x years before the biofuel crop is established), but not the intermediary land uses.\u201d Thus it is assumed that the earlier baseline is conservative from the emission counting perspective. As outlined in the RED (Annex V C, 7), calculations of changes in ABCS for 2020 requires the comparison of land use/cover in 2020 with the situation in 2008. Global spatial land use/cover data providing the required detail for this work was available only for the year 2000, thus all the following comparisons are based on the reference land use/cover in 2000 Different agro-economic models may use different classifications or aggregations for the crops. Prior to the spatial allocation they have been re-classed into the classification system of the spatial allocation procedure. o Climate Regions and Carbon Stocks in Biomass Carre et al . (2009) provide mean values of ABCS in t C ha -1 for the land use/cover classes in different ecological zones and climate regions, largely based on the 2003 IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry and other sources (see next chapter). The nominal values for ABCS data of grassland are given for Climate Regions while the values for open and closed forest are given for Ecological Zones und further distinguish geographical aggregations.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 90 To map the nominal C-stock values in ABCS to climate regions and geographic aggregations a data set combining the two themes has been generated. Following the specifications of Table 4.1 of Volume 4 of IPCC (2006) the climate regions \u201cWarm Temperate\u201d was substituted by the \u201cSubtropical\u201d domain and \u201cCool Temperate\u201d by the \u201cTemperate\u201d domain. The resulting map of climate regions and 8 geographic aggregations is presented in Figure 27. Figure 27: Climate Regions and Geographic Aggregations for ABCS o Above- and Belowground Biomass Carbon Stock for Individual Land Use/Cover Classes The ABCS values given in Carre et al . (2009) to calculate changes in carbon stocks are based on the assumptions that for non-cropland vegetation the ABCS amounts to a maximum quantity which is considered constant over time under prevailing natural and management conditions. The entire biomass and dead organic matter is cleared when land use change occurs, thus all C is emitted into the atmosphere as CO 2 after conversion. For annual crops it is assumed that the C stock is zero, while in perennial woody crops a time constant C stock is assumed which is equal to the half of the C stock in biomass reached at the end of the production cycle. While ABCS for grassland and forest corresponds to the values given in IPCC (2003), additional information from the literature has been taken into account for the ABCS values of shrubland and biofuel crops in Carre et al . (2009). For the classes \u2018sparse vegetation\u2019 and \u2018wetland\u2019 no ABCS data is cited in Carre et al . (2009). By expert judgment we assume \u2018sparse vegetation\u2019 to have 15% of the ABCS of grassland. For completeness reasons the ABCS for Wetlands are included, although they are not considered as subject to conversion in this work. Wetlands are assumed to consist 60% of grassland, 20% of open forest and 20% of closed forest (no open water was assumed, as at least part of the year the land is generally not covered by water). ABCS for wetlands was calculated from the grassland and open-closed forest ABCS values considering the before mentioned shares. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 91 IPCC (2003) gives uncertainty ranges of 75 - 100% for the ABCS values in forest and grassland ecosystems, the same uncertainty range can be assumed also for shrubland, while for biofuel crops the uncertainty of ABCS was estimated based on available data and conservatively rounded to nearest 5 th /10 th . According to the assumptions mentioned before, no ABCS is assigned to the annual crop classes of maize, wheat, rice and \u2018other crops\u2019. The remaining agricultural classes considered in our study (sugar crops, vegetables and fruits, oilseeds) are a mixture of annual, perennial shrub and tree crops. The share may differ largely between countries. From the McGill M3 crop data (Monfreda et al ., 2008) we calculated the shares of the perennial crop sugar cane in the class \u2018sugar crops\u2019, the share of shrub and tree fruits in the class \u2018vegetables and fruits\u2019 as well as the share of the tree crops oilpalm, coconut, olive, karite and tung in the class \u201coilseed\u201d for each country (see Table 41 in Appendix II), all other crops in these classes are considered as annual. The ABCS for these shrub and tree crops was estimated based on literature research and comparison of the plant size and dimensions (i.e. crown shape, height) with other woody crops existing in the same ecological region (Blujdea, 2010). It was also assumed that the C stock is constant over time and that it is half of the maximum reached at end of a production cycle. The ABCS values (t C ha -1 ) used in this study are given in Appendix 2 (see Table 42). Based on the shares of the shrub and tree crops, country specific mean ABCS values for the land use classes sugar crops, oilseeds, vegetables and fruits were calculated. In cases of cropland decrease it is currently supposed that the regional average ABCS developing on these areas corresponds to the regional average ABCS we calculate for the areas where conversion into cropland occurs.

IFPRI-MIRAGE DATA The input data for estimating GHG emissions from ILUC were taken from the revised IFPRI data (version of 17.05.2010) and the output of the land allocation model. In the analysis data from the scenarios \u201c Business as Usual \u201d (BAU), \u201c Free Trade \u201d (FT) and \u201c Reference \u201d (REF) for 2020 were processed. All other data originates from base-layer dataset. The output of the IFPRI model used in this study distinguishes 11 regions. Results are presented by country and as total values for LUC and C emissions. This representation was given preference to mapping regional figures or relative changes because eventually the quantity of GHG emissions per country are relevant. 4.1.1. S PATIAL A LLOCATION AND S OIL C ARBON E MISSIONS The output received from the IFPRI MIRAGE model relates to two different scenarios of world trade. \u2022 IFPRI BAU Scenario The changes in land cover provided by the spatial allocation procedure are used to estimate subsequent changes in C stocks.

The conversion of land to cropland at this level could be expected to reduce SOC stocks by - 7.80 Mt, which would amount to 28.6 Mt of CO 2 emissions from the soil. For the FT scenario cropland expands 9,758.9 km 2 . The change in land use modelled to result in a loss of SOC of 8.73 Mt or 32.0 Mt of CO 2 emissions from the soil. The area of ILUC seems to be very low. In the BAU scenario the additional area for crops for growing biofuels amounts to approx. 90x90 km 2 globally. For the FT scenario the expanded area covers approx. 100x100 km 2 . This low figure suggests that the model allocates biofuels within existing cropland, which includes areas of set-aside, through intensification rather than in expanding cropland areas by land cover conversion. Changes in SOC through intensification on existing cropland are not included in the estimates. Between the FT and the BAU scenario land is converted to cropland increases by 1,550 km. The land conversion is regionally variable. Approximately 2/3 of the increase in land conversion from the BAU to the FT scenario is located in Brazil. The effect on SOC stocks from the BAU to the FT scenario also shows regional differences. While the area of converted land increases by 18.9% the losses in SOC increase by 16.7%. This indicates that the additional areas converted under the FT scenario may not differ in their characteristics from those converted under the BAU scenario. 4.1.2.

CO 2 E MISSIONS FROM C HANGES IN A BOVE - AND B ELOWGROUND B IOMASS C ARBON S TOCK IFPRI (2010) reports total GHG emissions of 43.4 Mt CO 2 eq (BAU scenario) and 46.1 Mt CO 2 (FT scenario) from loss of C in ABCS stock in areas subject to land use change. Based on our study the emissions due to change in ABCS result in 167.7 Mt CO 2 eq for the BAU scenario and 209.8 Mt CO 2 eq for the FT scenario (see Table 25). This large difference is mainly attributed by the fact, that the Spatial allocation procedure results in a higher share of closed forest (32%, see Figure 35) - with the highest ABCS of all land covers - converted into cropland than assumed in the IFPRI study (9% primary forest conversion, see Figure 34). However it is not mentioned explicitly in the IFPRI report which ABCS value was assigned to primary forest, thus it is not known if it is similar to the values for closed forests in our study. In both cases IPCC (2003) served as the basic source for the ABCS values, with additional information for shrublands and biofuel crops in our study as described in Carre et al . (2009). The main land use change occurs in Brazil. It accounts for approx. 60% (BAU scenario) to 70% (FT scenario) of the global land use change modelled by IFPRI (see Figure 36 and Figure 37). Based on our study, the share in terms of CO 2 emissions compared to the global total is even higher (67% BAU scenario, 77% FT scenario) as the main land use/cover classes converted - closed forest and shrubland - show the highest ABCS ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 101 values (see Table 42 in Appendix 2) and the conversion rate is above the global mean (see Table 40, left and right graphic). In our study we consider also the ABCS in permanent crops as sugar cane and tree crops. If land use/cover is converted into a sugar cane plantation, the mean annual carbon stock for sugar cane (4 - 5 t C ha -1 ) is accounted for in the emission balance. In the case of Brazil the cultivation of sugar cane contributes with a positive carbon stock of 3 -5 Mt C (BAU and FT scenario respectively) to the total balance (see Figure 38 and Figure 39). Also in Europe and the Indo-Malaysia regions ABCS occurs on the positive side of the balance. In the IndoMalaysia region this is mainly caused by the conversion into oil palm plantations with an ABCS of approx. 60 t C ha -1 (see Table 42). In Europe the positive values in the emission balance is however mainly an artificial effect of the aggregation of classes. IFPRI predicts an increase of oilseed cultivation area in Europe, composed mainly of rapeseed and sunflower and to a minor extent also soybean. As a result of the spatial allocation procedure the oilseed cultivation area extension occurs mainly in Spain, Germany, France and Italy (see Figure 40). During the spatial allocation oilseeds are considered a single crop class and herbaceous crops are not distinguished from tree crops. As described in Chapter 5.4, a \u201cmean\u201d ABCS per ha was calculated for the oilseed crop class in each country based on the mean composition of oilseed crops in this country. As in Spain and Italy olive trees (ABCS approx. 43 t C ha - 1 ) contribute with 71% and 67% to the oilseed cultivation area, the average ABCS for oilseeds in these countries is about 30 t C ha -1 . This ABCS is then attributed to all oilseed extension area within the country, although the IFPRI data predicts an extension only for the 3 abovementioned annual herbaceous crops which should not be assigned any ABCS. In the global emission balance this effect is negligible in the current case, but it will be a point for future improvements. The land use/cover classes used in the IFPRI study cannot be matched exactly with the classes considered within our study (see Table 24), therefore no detailed comparison using the individual ABCS for a certain land use/cover class of from our study is possible. However, a back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that most probably at least some of the ABCS values in our study are higher than in the IFPRI study. This has to be examined more in detail. Differences may occur e.g. by including/excluding root biomass and dead organic mater (litter, dead wood). Both biomass compartments are considered in the ABCS values for our study. The share in total ABCS is 25% and more in the case of root biomass and around 5% in the case of dead organic matter in closed forest. ",

JRC-IPTS AGLINK-COSIMO D ATA As with all model data received in form of spreadsheet tables the data were transferred to tables of a relation database (RDB). The transfer to the RDB allows evaluating data for consistency and integrity. This transfer also includes an implementation of the data structure. The aggregation of regions in the AGLINK-COSIMO data follows a multi- level approach. Initially single countries and some country aggregates (including EU-15 ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 108 and EU-12) are calculated and thereafter aggregates are built. A multi-level structure for crops was reconstructed by the authors of this report from a logical arrangement of the countries and regions based on the data received from JRC-IPTS and in a manner that was suitable for the spatial allocation procedure. At Level 1 three regions are defined: AGLINK aggregate, COSIMO aggregate and \u201c Rest of the World \u201d. Those regions are subdivided into 20 regions of Level 2. The structure of the crops and their aggregations as used in the project are given in Table 26.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 109 are modelled only for those countries for which the commodities are relevant in economic terms. When preparing the data for the study some additional particulars of the crop aggregation scheme had to be considered. According to the aggregation Rice is reported separately from the \u201c Cereals \u201d group. \u201c Coarse Grains \u201d include maize in the aggregation schema, but is not reported for all regional aggregation levels. Also, there is no group summing all other crops which could be used as a correspondence to the group \u201cOther Crops\u201d used in the study. Given the importance of coarse grains for biofuels the variability of reporting grain maize depending on the aggregation level and region was dealt with by defining two runs for the emission analysis: a) data for maize are used where available (GM run); b) coarse grain areas are used to represent maize areas where they are not reported (CG run). In practice, these two runs of the spatial allocation procedure delimit a range for a value of a distinct crop of grain maize: maize cannot be more than what is used in CG run, and not less than what is used in GM run. With respect to the total cropland area or any other crop group there is no difference between the data of the two runs. 4.2.1.

Here the merge of grain maize with coarse grains has resulted in a decrease in SOC stocks in some countries, such as Nigeria and Angola, and an increase in others, such as South Africa or Mozambique. \u2022 Carbon and CO2 Emission Estimates from Soil As regards the management and system factors for computing changes in SOC stocks the treatment of grain maize as a distinct crop or including the crop in the group of coarse grains, and therefore as part of the crop group \u201c Other crops \u201d, is of no consequence. However, with respect to the spatial distribution the areas where grain maize, coarse grains and other crops are found varies. As a consequence, the factors influencing SOC, which are soil type, management practice and system, differ with geographic location of the crop. Globally, the harvested maize area for 2008 is 1,610,165.42 km 2 . This amounts to 22.6 % of all harvested area for cereals, or 12.4 % of the harvested area of all primary crops (FAO Statistics Division, 08. July, 2010) 35 . For the CG run the area under change attributed to grain maize is 7,160 km 2 while for the GM run the area is 2,994 km 2 . Although the changes are small compared to the overall area under maize the figures differ by a factor of almost 2.5. Thus, changes in the treatment of gain maize in the estimation of CO 2 emissions can be expected to have 35 http://faostat.fao.org/site/291/default.aspx ",

In case all areas under coarse grain are treated as grain maize the losses in SOC amount to 59.7 Mt or 218.9 Mt CO 2 , an increase of 8.5% over the GM run. The difference indicates that grain maize is spatially associated with other soil types and land management systems than other coarse grains. 4.2.2.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 115 The predicted area subject to a land use change is around 5 times higher than in the IFPRI scenarios due to different assumptions for the scenarios as described previously. The major land use change occurs in EU27 (see Figure 46), followed by Brazil, Argentina, and the other Asian countries (OAC delineation). In general the land use change is more scattered over the globe than in the IFPRI study. The share of land use/cover classes converted into cropland in EU27 as output of the spatial allocation is rather similar to the IFPRI result (compare Figure 35 and Figure 45). In Brazil a slightly higher share of shrubland and lower share of closed forest can be observed. For the global average a lower share of shrubland and a higher share of sparse vegetation are subject to land use change based on IPTS results compared to the IFPRI results. The major contribution to the total CO 2 emission results from land use/cover change in Brazil (see Figure 47). This is due to the fact that ABCS values for tropical closed forests and shrublands are significantly higher than in the corresponding classes in temperate Europe (see Table 42). Further, the area of shrubland subject to conversion in Brazil is more than 2 times higher than in Europe (see Figure 46). Notable are the GHG emissions in Canada and the US, despite the small share of land conversion, the contribution to the global greenhouse gas emissions is high due to ABCS values in North American forests of up to 400 t C ha -1 . Looking at the positive side of the C balance (see Figure 47), the effect of class aggregation - described in the previous section - may lead to an overestimation of the ABCS related to the oilseeds class also in this case. Global emissions from changes in ABCS based on the spatial allocation of the IPTS- AGLINK-COSIMO biofuels scenario results are calculated to be approx. 865 Mt CO 2 eq with a major part of the emissions resulting from land use change in South America and Europe (see Table 29)..

Changes in soil carbon stock contribute with ~15 to 20%, whereas N 2 O emissions related to loss in soil C stock have only a small share (2- 3%) compared to the other sources. It needs to be outlined that the emissions from change in ABCS depend strongly on the assumptions about the share of forest to be converted into cropland. A small change in the share may cause a considerable increase/decrease of the emissions as the biomass stock - thus the carbon released due to the conversion - is generally high compared to other land uses as e.g. grasslands. 4.4.

The extra energy production values differ by a factor approx. 3 (IFPRI- MIRAGE 300 Million GJ vs. IPTS-AGLINK 865 Million GJ). As prescribed in the RED the total emission from change in soil and biomass carbon stock are distributed equally over a period of 20 years. Then the annualized emissions are compared with the increase in annual biofuel production. From Table 31 the study found that annual emissions per amount of energy produced are in the range of o 34 - 41 g CO 2 eq MJ -1 for the IFPRI-MIRAGE scenarios and o approx. 63 g CO 2 eq MJ -1 for IPTS-AGLINK. These differences are the result of the output generated by the agro-economic models and the various assumptions made in the definition of scenarios. The model output varies with respect to the additional area of arable land, the regions to which those areas are allocated and the expansion of crops as a function of the ratio between biodiesel and bioethanol.

T OTAL E MISSIONS FROM B IOFUEL P RODUCTION Annex V of the RED describes the methodology to calculate life cycle GHG emissions from different biofuels pathways. It also contains a list of typical and default values for their direct GHG savings, which accounts for emissions from cultivation, processing, transport and distribution, but do not include emissions from LUC. Therefore, in order to see the effect of ILUC adjunct based on the model results on the default emissions given in the legislation of the RED, the \u201cILUC emissions\u201d should be added to the default values in the Directive. Since the total annual emissions due to LUC calculated in this study refer to \u201cbiofuels\u201d demand increase (i.e. are not disaggregated by individual crop), a \u201cweighted\u201d default value for direct GHG savings has been calculated by the JRC, weighting the default values for individual biofuels by their proportion in EU demand in 2020 as provided by the MIRAGE and AGLINK-COSIMO simulations. That is satisfactory for looking at the possible effect of an ILUC adder in legislation. But the RED states that for the purpose of policy analysis a different methodology should be used. Instead of allocating a proportion of emissions to by-products according to their energy content, the by-products generate an emissions credit calculated from what they replace (\u2018substitution\u2019 or \u2018systems expansion\u2019) approach.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 129 5. S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSIONS The study successfully applies the methodology previously developed for estimating GHG emissions from soil and vegetation from indirect land use changes (ILUC) to the results from two different economic models on biofuel production in 2020. Using harmonised spatial data as the basis for allocating extra land demands allows for a much more detailed analysis of the effects biofuels production on GHG emissions than is possible with the data available for broad geographic regions. The various processing modules and stages present quite different challenges to be addressed and lead to some distinct constraints which should be considered when comparing the findings of this study with the results of other studies. 5.1. B ASE D ATA AND P REPARATION In the preparation of the base data, great care should be taken to produce consistent thematic layers. With the marginal changes analysed being so small at the global scale, even minor geographic irregularities between spatial layers can considerably distort the results. With a land surface area of 135,708,500 km 2 (not including Antarctica) the extra land demands are minute (<0.006% for the IFPRI BAU scenario). Geographic characteristics must be uniform and the layers must also be consistent in the representation of thematic parameters. In this respect, the base data had to be substantially adjusted to the specifications of the methodology for GHG emission calculations. In particular, the two forest classes defined in the RED do not match the classification schemes generally used for global land use and cover data, so the corresponding classes had to be estimated. Information on cropland was taken from the McGill M3 dataset to provide a better correspondence with FAO statistical data on the distribution of individual crops, which are also used by the economic models. The McGill M3 dataset used in this study is not without its shortcomings. It refers to the status of crop areas as of the year 2000 and, due to the disaggregation method used, the spatial resolution is a rather nominal value. The demand for data consistency is particularly relevant to datasets with a hierarchical structure, such as the climate regions and ecological zone layers. These thematic layers were completely generated from climate data to avoid overlaps or gaps in the delineated areas, which could lead to artefacts being introduced into the results. Only the Harmonized World Soil Database was found to be suitable for generating a suitable soil-related base data. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 130 5.2. S PATIAL A LLOCATION OF E XTRA L AND D EMAND When dealing with results of agro-economic models which are used as the input data for the spatial allocation procedure, the different timeframes to which the data relate had to be dealt with. Although aligned to FAO statistics, the McGill M3 data used the year 2000 as a baseline. Data for 2008 or projections to the year 2020 are not available in any level of detail. This introduces an inconsistency with respect to the use of the reference years reported in the output data of the economic models. As a consequence, the 2020 reference scenario data projected by the models could not be used directly by this study. Instead, the analysis was based on the marginal changes between the policy and the reference scenarios projected for 2020, and the differences were applied to the base data. This approach assumes that cropland expansion until 2020 will not significantly influence the characteristics of the additional land used as a consequence of growing biofuels. Specifically, soil carbon stocks, land cover types and crop yields are assumed to remain constant across the area of cropland expansion. This assumption is justified by the fact that the aim of this exercise is to calculate the impact of ILUC due to the biofuel policies and not to the general changes in cropland demand. On the other hand, it represents a bias in the allocation process, because the output of the spatial allocation procedure could be affected by the absolute amount of land being allocated. Another constraint on cropland expansion modelling is the method applied to account properly for competition for land between the various crops. The output from the AGLINK-COSIMO model is only complete for a selected set of important crops and does not provide a complete land use estimate. As a consequence, the substitution of crops for which the demand is decreasing (non-biofuel crops) by those for which demand is increasing (biofuel crops) cannot be modelled, and thus the amount of land to be converted to cropland (and the associated GHG emissions) could be overestimated. To avoid any misunderstandings, it is worth mentioning that the spatial allocation procedure used at the JRC does not include any form of economic modelling. The economic data are taken from the model results and are converted to spatial layers using proximity and biophysical criteria. 5.3. GHG E MISSIONS FROM ILUC The demand for extra land modelled by IFPRI for the year 2020 using the MIRAGE model come to 8,209 km 2 (BAU scenario) and 9,759 km 2 (FT scenario). The extra demands estimated by the JRC-IPTS using the AGLINK-COSIMO model come to 52,372 km 2 . ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 131 According to IFPRI data, the emissions from soil as a result of land use changes on the extra land required in the BAU scenario are 201.4 Mt CO 2 eq (16.7% from soil, 83.3% from vegetation) and 248.0 Mt CO 2 eq (15.4% from soil, 84.6% from vegetation) in the FT scenario. Using the JRC-IPTS data, the GHG emissions are estimated at 1,108.9 Mt CO 2 eq (22.3% from soil, 77.7% from vegetation). With regard to biofuel production, savings in GHG emissions of >35% are estimated to be reached after 30 years using the IFPRI data (FT scenario) and after 300 years using the JRC-IPTS data. The economic analysis carried out by IFPRI places most of the land demands on Brazil, where the largest increase in cropland area is driven by sugar cane (7,575.1 km 2 ) and soybean (602.5 km 2 ). This increase in crop area amounts to approx. 50% of the global area of crop expansion (16,229.9 km 2 crop area expansion vs 8,020.9 km 2 crop area contraction). The output of the AGLINK-COSIMO model managed by the JRC-IPTS shows a much lower rate of exchange between existing crops and crop area expansion. The total area of cropland is reported to be modelled as 61,045.2 km 2 while the area of cropland contraction is 8,673.1 km 2 . Most of the cropland expansion is allocated to the EU27 region (24.0%), while the expansion in Brazil is modelled at 16.2%. The study found that the absolute figure of the crop land expansion area is not the only criterion that determines GHG emissions, but that type of land converted is also of significant importance. With the largest variations in carbon stock and potential emissions assigned to forests (from almost 0 to over 400 t C ha -1 ), the proportion of forest converted to cropland is of overriding importance to the GHG emission estimates. The following summary indicates the amount of forest that could be converted to cropland according four different studies: Forest Converted Study % of Total EPA 41 32 ICONE 42 5 JRC 43 36 IFPRI 44 16 The figure in the EPA report is taken directly from the historical trends provided by Winrock with the comparison of remote sensing images between 2001 and 2004. ICONE results are based on the use of a specific economic land use model (BLUM- Brazilian Land Use Model) that aims to analyse and project allocated areas for each activity and land use change. 41 Table 2.6-13 of EPA (2009) 42 Table 6 of ICONE (2009) 43 This study. 44 Figure 8 of IFPRI (2010). Primary and Managed forest are combined. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 132 IFPRI provides economic results from a Computable Global Equilibrium model (MIRAGE) and then uses historical land use changes and competition between cropland, pasture and managed forest to determine the respective shares of land use types converted into cropland. The proportion of forest converted ranges from 5% in the ICONE study to 36% in the JRC study. These differences are considered the most important factor explaining the discrepancies in the total GHG emission calculations reported by different sources. The rather large differences between the estimated GHG emissions from biomass (43.4 Mt CO 2 in the IFPRI report vs. 167.7 Mt CO 2 in this study) are largely attributed to this dissimilarity in the allocation of the extra land. The land conversion is determined by the competition between cropland and other managed land (pasture and managed forest), and also by the assumption made with respect to the replacement of the different types of natural vegetation. The JRC study does not distinguish pasture from grassland or managed forest from unmanaged forest, partly because the distinction between managed and natural areas using remote sensing images is problematic. EPA MODIS trends are also based on remote sensing images and do not distinguish managed land from natural land. IFPRI and ICONE deal with statistics rather than spatial information, and they model the competition between cropland, pasture and managed forest. Concerning the expansion of cropland as compared to natural vegetation, the assumption made by ICONE (ICONE, 2009) seems to differ from the conservative approach taken in JRC study. ICONE considers that, for each region, all the expansion occurs over the majority biome type, while the JRC study keeps the share between biomes constant at local level. EPA and IFPRI use historical trends provided by Winrock. To some degree the assumptions made about the land allocation of other models are based on conjecture and information extracted from reports. For a more in-depth analysis of the discrepancies between the different studies and a better understanding of the effect of land allocations, additional information on the specific allocation process used by IFPRI and ICONE is needed.

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 133 5.4. O UTLOOK This study demonstrates the viability of the methodology developed for using spatial data and processing techniques to provide more detailed estimates of GHG emissions resulting from biofuels than were hitherto available. The scope of the study does not cover all areas involved in estimating GHG emissions from biofuels which occur as a result of ILUC. The following main areas were identified as being necessary to incorporate in further improvements of the methodology and expansions of the range of subjects covered: o Estimation of GHG Emission Uncertainties When comparing the different results, it has to be kept in mind that there are high levels of uncertainty involved in each step of the calculation chain, starting from the economic model results, spatial allocation, land use/cover and other input data up to the above- and belowground biomass values applied. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution. The focus of this work was to test and describe the method and to show the influence of different assumptions on the results. However, a detailed uncertainty analysis has to be undertaken in order to allow robust conclusions to be drawn. o Modelling to Reference Period In this study the modelled reference conditions are not simulated in the spatial data. The approach used to adjust for this shortcoming is to transfer the changes between the scenario and reference data to a baseline dataset. Developing a set of reference data for climate and land use / cover for 2020 or beyond is one of the challenges facing future developments. The other dataset to be adjusted to the scenario period are the factors defining the management system. This information is at times available at farm level or national level, such as fertiliser application rates, but only partially at the scale of the project. Future investigations may also want to include land conservation practices (tillage) in the mapping of management systems. o Effect of Climate Change The study assumed no change in climatic conditions between the year of the base data (2000) and scenario (2020). Climate change models indicate geographically variable shifts in climatic conditions over this 20-year period. These changes in climatic conditions from the base to the scenario period on soil carbon and the distribution of crops could be investigated as to their effect on GHG emissions. ",
        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 134 o Feedback with Economic Models For future developments, a feedback mechanism to economic models is recommended. In some regions, the spatial allocation procedure has experienced difficulties in distributing the total amount of hectares reported by the economic models because the total surface of \u2018naturally suitable land\u2019 is less than the area given by the economic models. The aim of this study was to use the crop allocation model to spatially distribute the different economic results in order to deduce the ecological impact of biofuel policies. There are other areas for improvement in the data used or development of the methodology applied, such as adaptation to the data available from external sources or the increase in spatial resolution of the spatial reference. At this stage most global data sets are available at 5 arc min. grid size, although a trend can be noted towards 30 arc sec. (about 1km grid size at the Equator) or even higher. However, before increasing the spatial resolution of the data, issues of uncertainty in the data should be addressed. A new direction of investigation could be opened by including issues of biodiversity and land degradation into the analysis. While in principal the methodology allows the related constraints and demands to be incorporated, considerable effort needs to be made to produce suitable data at the global scale. ",

        "Biofuels: a New Methodology to Estimate GHG Emissions Due to Global Land Use Change 141 Appendix I Example of Spatial Allocation of Cropland in Brazil This section contains results of some cropland allocation simulations performed on Brazil. The methodology and dataset used are those described in the previous sections of this document. Even if the uncertainty takes an important place in the cropland allocation modelling, it is of interest to run simulation on cropland expansion for several reasons. First, these simulations give an order of magnitude on the impact of the different scenario policies. Despite the fact that it is not possible to determine precisely what will be the quantity of carbon released in the atmosphere by any agricultural policy in ten years time, the simulations can give a first idea on the importance of the emissions. Second, it is useful to assess the range of possible output values under very favourable and unfavourable conditions (sensitivity analysis). Applied to GHG emission calculations it can give an indication on the maximum emission reached in case of allocating cropland in a particularly \u201cunfavourable\u201d environment or on the minimum GHG emission level under which it would not be possible to go down even with ecological practices and the best use of the best land available. Third, running the model many times with slight variations in input parameters or using a stochastic approach provides a large set of results and allows statistical analysis more relevant than the result of a single simulation. \u2022 Crop Demand Table 39 indicates the level and variation of land use by crop sector in Brazil according to /IFPRI-MIRAGE study. The values are given for three different scenarios in 2020 (Baseline, Business As Usual (BAU) and Free Trade (TL)). This table is used as economic data input for the spatial allocation process. ",

The methodology follows a two-step approach: \u2022 Creation of database (e.g. land use/crop cover/soil types etc.), combining different data sources into a single harmonised database; \u2022 Simulation based on cropland demands from the general equilibrium model MIRAGE (run by IFPRI) and on cropland demand from the partial equilibrium model AGLINK-COSIMO (run by JRC-IPTS). For this work a dedicated set of spatial data layers was developed at 5 arc min resolution. Global cropland data for 2000 (used as the reference year) are merged with land cover data, adjusting the proportions to fully cover an area with land use and cover types whilst keeping the reference data constant. In the simulation process data on land cover change (between 2001 and 2004) are used to identify the conversion of non-cropland into new cropland. Cropland demand for individual crops and aggregated crop classes are spatially allocated using the criteria of land suitability and distance from existing cropland. The outcome of the simulation process is a set of land use maps describing the estimated shares of each crop or group of crops according to different biofuel scenarios. This information is then used to estimate related GHG emissions according to the Tier 1 approach as developed under the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories that result from a given change in biofuel demand.
