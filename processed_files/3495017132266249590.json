        "G 20 1 EU PARTICIPATION IN THE G20 Did you know that\u2026 \u2022 The European Union is a full member of the G20 alongside four of its Member States: France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom; Spain is a permanent invitee of the G20. \u2022 The EU has its own seat at the G20 table because it is one of the largest global economic areas with specific competences in issues on the G20 agenda. The EU is represented at the G20 by the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. THE EU IN THE WORLD With 510 million inhabitants, the EU accounts for just under 7% of the world population (7.3 billion inhabitants). China (18.7%) and India (17.8%) are more populous, while the United States (4.4%), Indonesia (3.5%) and Brazil (2.8%) account for a lower share of the world population than the EU.

        "G 20 2 THE EU ECONOMY Did you know that\u2026 \u2022 The EU accounted for a 21.8% share of the world\u2019s GDP in 2016. GDP per capita in the EU\u2019s 28 Member States is \u20ac29,000; in the 19 euro area countries it is \u20ac31,600. This places Europe among the five top performing global economies. EU AND G20 SHARE OF WORLD POPULATION Rest of the world GDP EU GDP EU G20 PRIORITIES \u2022 The European Union set out its views on what this G20 should deliver in a joint letter by Presidents Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, which was sent to EU Heads of State or Government on 3 July. EU G20 Leaders also coordinated their positions at a preparatory meeting on 29 June 2017 in Berlin, hosted by Angela Merkel, Federal Chancellor of Germany and Chair of the G20. Joint letter of Presidents Juncker and Tusk: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/ publications/letter-presidents-juncker-and-tusk-g20-summit-hamburg_en 1. HARNESSING GLOBALISATION The global and European economies are gathering momentum, but many European citizens still do not feel the benefits of growth, or worry that they might be left behind by globalisation. As set out in our recently-published Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation, the European Commission believes that strong and sustainable growth requires: an external response which commits to the multilateral system and to ensuring a level playing field; and a domestic response to build resilience of our citizens through education and skills development and to better distribute the benefits of globalisation through the European social model. ",
        "G 20 3 As Presidents Juncker and Tusk write in their letter to EU leaders, we must work to make trade and investment free as well as fair. The EU will support a continued commitment of the G20 to fight protectionism and strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system, anchored in the WTO, which is our best chance for a global level playing field. The EU will call for a particular focus on e-commerce and subsidies when it comes to filling the gaps in the global rulebook. The EU pursues reciprocal access to foreign markets for European business when negotiating new agreements, and defends its workers and its companies robustly in case of breaches of the global rulebook. On the matter of overcapacity, the EU considers this as an utmost priority, in particular steel overcapacity, which is being addressed by the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity launched at last year\u2019s G20. China is producing half of the world's steel and its overcapacity alone (over 300 million tons) is twice the whole EU production (162 million tons). The EU aims for the removal of subsidies and other government-imposed distortions which are at the root of the problem. The EU will also underline the need to prepare for the profound impact of digitalisation and automation on labour, by investing in digital skills and adapting social security systems to benefit workers in all work arrangements. Did you know that... \u2022 For the European Union, trade means jobs \u2013 every \u20ac1 billion in exports supports 14,000 jobs in the EU. More than 30 million jobs depend on exports to the rest of the world - around 1 in every 7 jobs in the EU. For every \u20ac1 billion we get in exports, 14,000 extra jobs are created across the EU ",
        "G 20 4 \u2022 The EU is the largest exporter and importer of goods and services in the world . Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role, as over 80% of European exporters are SMEs. \u2022 80% of EU imports consist of raw materials, capital goods and components necessary for the European economy to function. \u2022 59.1% of all EU exports of goods are destined for G20 members, most notably the United States (20.8%), China (9.7%) and Russia (4.1%). Collectively, the G20 members provide over three fifths (63.4%) of the EU\u2019s imports of goods, with China (20.2%), the United States (14.5%) and Russia (7.0%) being the main sources. \u2022 In addition to the WTO agreement that involves the EU and 135 partners around the world, the EU currently has 38 bilateral and regional trade agreements in place, which cover over 67 partners. The EU is currently involved in negotiations for 18 bilateral and regional trade and investment agreements covering 51 countries. \u2022 Our recently signed Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, our most progressive ever, sets the template for our ongoing negotiations with Japan, Mercosur and Mexico. \u2022 The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, set up in 2007, helps workers who lost their jobs as a consequence of changing trade patterns to be retrained, find a new job or start a new business. In ten years it has provided \u20ac600 million to help 139,227 redundant workers and 3,069 young people not in employment, education or training. \u2022 In May 2017 the European Commission published a Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation , as a contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of Europe.

        "G 20 6 2. ECONOMIC GROWTH, TAX TRANSPARENCY AND A STABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH The European economy has proven resilient in the face of significant challenges. Growth rates in both the EU and the euro area were nearly 2% in 2016 , public finances are improving and employment is at a record level. Unemployment is at its lowest level since 2009 and investments exceed pre-crisis levels in some Member States. The EU economy will continue to enjoy this positive trend in 2018 with growth projected for the sixth year in a row. The Hamburg Action Plan will be a key deliverable of the G20 Summit. The EU will support policy measures to make the G20 economies more resilient and to improve the efficiency and composition of public finances, in support of growth and equity. Investment in infrastructure, skills and effective social security deserve particular attention. Did you know that... \u2022 The Investment Plan for Europe, introduced in 2014 by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, has reached two thirds of its original \u20ac315 billion investment target. The \u2018Juncker Plan\u2019 has so far triggered \u20ac209 billion of investment in projects across Europe, supporting at least 200,000 jobs. \u2022 The Commission intends to build on this success and increase the total size of the Investment Plan for Europe to reach \u20ac500 billion by 2020 . ",
        "G 20 7 SPENDING UNDER THE INVESTMENT PLAN FOR EUROPE \u2022 Tackling youth unemployment remains a top priority for the EU, with the EU Youth Guarantee aiming to ensure that all young people receive an offer of work, training or education within four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed. So far, more than 14 million young people have been helped by this initiative. \u2022 The European Commission's Better Regulation Agenda contributes to creating a positive climate for investment in the EU. The Better Regulation Agenda is reforming the EU law-making process, increasing transparency and accountability, and ensuring that EU laws are as effective and efficient as possible, whilst maintaining ambitious policy objectives. The Juncker Commission has tabled 80% fewer initiatives in each of its annual Work Programmes compared to previous Commissions, and has so far withdrawn over 100 pending legislative proposals. 4 #TeamJunckerEU THE JUNCKER COMMISSION: TWO YEARS ON Better Regulation NEW INITIATIVES 2015 PROPOSALS FOR WITHDRAWAL 2015 PRIORITY INITIATIVES PROPOSALS FOR WITHDRAWAL REPEALED LAWS INITIATIVES FOR REGULATORY SIMPLIFICATION 130 per year 2010-2014 23 2015 109 2015-2017 48 2015-2017 137 2015-2017 Better regulations in numbers, 2015-2017 23 2016 21 2017 ",

The EU calls for effective implementation of agreed international standards on tax transparency, base erosion and profit sharing, and maintains a firm stance on developing a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. The EU will call for further steps within the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to improve authorities\u2019 access to information about ultimate beneficiaries of legal persons and arrangements, as well as cross-border exchange of this information. Did you know that... \u2022 For more than 10 years, the European Union has stressed that automatic exchange of information for tax purposes should be made a global standard; this solution is now also recognised by the G20. \u2022 The European Union is at the forefront of global efforts on automatic exchange of information for tax purposes : in June 2016, the EU\u2019s Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was finalised, and in May 2017 these rules were extended to close tax avoidance loopholes between the laws of EU Member States and non-EU countries. ",
        "G 20 9 \u2022 Since January 2017, EU Member States have been obliged to automatically exchange information on financial accounts, as an important step against offshore tax evasion. Every six months national tax authorities must also now send a report to the depository, listing all the cross-border tax rulings that they have issued. Other Member States are able to check those lists and to ask the issuing Member State for more detailed information on a particular ruling. \u2022 European legislators are currently negotiating additional important proposals to prevent tax abuse, including public country-by-country reporting, stronger Anti- Money Laundering provisions and tighter governance rules for EU funds. A number of other substantial corporate tax reforms have also been proposed, notably the re- launch of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) in October 2016. \u2022 In July 2016 the next steps to increase tax transparency and tackle tax abuse were set out. This agenda has already borne fruit and is now being further strengthened by the Commission's proposal of June 2017 for new transparency rules for intermediaries who provide tax advice that leads to a loss in revenues for Member States.

        "G 20 10 DELIVERING A RESILIENT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM The European Union aims to keep financial regulation high on the G20 agenda. In their letter to the EU Member States, Presidents Juncker and Tusk call for the G20 to complete the Basel III post-crisis reforms, and to encourage a swift outcome that promotes a level playing field and does not significantly increase the overall capital requirements for banks. The EU supports the work of the Financial Stability Board to evaluate the effects of financial regulatory reforms and monitor emerging risks and vulnerabilities. The EU will also urge the G20 to put in place and enforce measures to tackle cybersecurity within each financial institution to ensure their systems are protected and strengthened in the face of cybersecurity threats. Did you know that... \u2022 The EU Banking Union is a key element of our Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It is designed to ensure that banks are more resilient to shocks, that they are better supervised, that savers\u2019 deposits are guaranteed and that tax payers are not the first in line when problems arise in the financial sector. \u2022 On 6-7 June 2017, a bank was resolved for the first time under the new Single Resolution Mechanism in the Banking Union. Following the resolution decision, which involved the sale of Banco Popular to Banco Santander, the bank was able to fully continue its business activities. Customers of Banco Popular continue to be served with no disruption to the economy. \u2022 The European Commission has proposed a European Deposit Insurance Scheme as an additional safety net for savers across Europe. \u2022 On 31 May 2017, the European Commission published a Reflection Paper on Deepening the Economic and Monetary Union, setting out a vision and roadmap for measures through to 2025 which will improve the instruments and architecture of the euro area, reduce economic and social divergences, and ensure transparent governance and democratic accountability.

        "G 20 11 3. CLIMATE ACTION AND ENERGY The EU was at the forefront in pushing for a global deal for climate change in Paris . Now is the time to focus on implementation, even if others are stepping back from their commitments. We will work with all partners who share our conviction that the Agreement is necessary to make our planet great again. The Agreement is fit for purpose, and a key element for the modernisation of the economy and to generate new and sustainable jobs and growth. The EU will reassure the international community that it is determined to implement the Paris Agreement and accelerate the low-carbon transition, as well as to support the poor and vulnerable in the fight against climate change. The Agreement is a key element for the modernisation of the economy and industry worldwide. It is the cornerstone of global efforts to tackle climate change, and cannot be renegotiated. The EU will support an ambitious G20 Joint Action Plan on Climate and Energy for Growth . It is now important to formulate long-term decarbonisation strategies, to promote the clean energy transition, to align sustainable finance flows with climate goals and to strengthen resilience to climate change. The EU will also work with G20 partners to improve resource efficiency and to tackle marine litter, as a contribution to the transition towards a circular economy taking into account the full life-cycle from production and consumption to waste management and the market for secondary raw materials. Did you know that... \u2022 The EU has successfully decoupled its economic growth from its greenhouse gas emissions ; during the 1990-2015 period, the EU\u2019s combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 50%, while total emissions decreased by 22%. \u2022 The EU is making good progress on the 2020 energy and climate targets . It has already achieved its 2020 final energy consumption target. The EU is also on track in the renewable sector where \u2013 based on 2015 data \u2013 the share of renewables has reached 16.4 % of the EU\u2019s gross final energy consumption. 27% ",
        "G 20 12 \u2022 The EU has also set clear targets for 2030: to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40%; to have at least 27% of EU energy consumption from renewables; to improve energy efficiency by at least 30%. \u2022 20% of the EU budget goes to climate-related expenditure . The LIFE programme is the EU\u2019s main funding instrument for the environment and climate action, and has co-financed more than 4,300 projects since 1992, mobilising \u20ac8.8 billion and contributing \u20ac3.9 billion to the protection of the environment and climate.

        "G 20 13 4. MANAGING MIGRATION In their joint letter to EU Heads of State or Government, Presidents Juncker and Tusk underline that forced displacement and irregular migration remain major global challenges. The EU will call on the G20 to improve global governance based on shared responsibility and partnership among countries of origin, transit and destination to protect refugees and migrants in need and alleviate the pressure on affected communities. The G20 should support the United Nations process to develop the Global Compacts on Refugees and for Regular, Safe and Orderly Migration. Did you know that... \u2022 EU operations have contributed to saving over 500,000 people at sea in the Mediterranean since 2015. \u2022 The European Commission proposed in December 2015 to establish a European Border and Coast Guard. The Agency was agreed in record time and launched on 6 October 2016; it is currently assisting Member States with over 1,600 border guards providing support at different sections of the EU external border, complementing the work of over 100,000 national border guards. \u2022 The EU is working closely with Turkey and other regional partners to replace dangerous journeys with safe and legal paths to the EU for vulnerable refugees. 16,419 people have been resettled to the EU since July 2015. \u2022 Under the emergency relocation scheme, adopted by the EU in September 2015, over 21,000 asylum seekers have been relocated from Greece and Italy, where they have arrived, to other Member States. ",
        "G 20 14 \u2022 The EU is helping displaced people in Turkey through its Facility for Refugees: \u20ac2.9 billion has already been allocated from the total \u20ac3 billion budget for 2016- 2017 providing services such as health, food and basic needs assistance, shelter, education, water and sanitation to refugees. 20 October 2015 10,006 arrivals A r r i v a l s 14 December 2015 5,005 arrivals 20 March 2016 EU Turkey Statement Daily average is now below 47 \u20ac \u20ac3 billion for 2016 - 2017 SCHOOL Humanitarian assistance Education Health Infrastructure socio-economic support \u2022 The EU is addressing the root causes of migration by working with its regional partners, for example through an Emergency Trust Fund for Africa worth \u20ac2.8 billion to promote development and security. \u2022 The EU introduced a new Migration Partnership Framework in June 2016, which fully embeds migration in the EU\u2019s foreign policy. Through the Partnership Framework, the EU aims at saving lives and breaking the business model of smugglers, preventing illegal migration and enhancing cooperation on returns and readmission of irregular migrants, as well as stepping up investments in partner countries. These objectives can only be achieved by working closely together with third countries, in a win-win partnership. \u2022 The EU is working together with the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to protect and improve the situation of migrants in Libya. Thanks to assisted voluntary return programmes carried out with IOM, more than 4,000 stranded migrants were able to return from Libya to their home countries since the beginning of 2017.

        "G 20 15 5. FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM The European Commission made security a top priority from day one, and has taken decisive action to cut terrorists off from the money, firearms and explosive substances they use to carry out attacks, to share intelligence between Member States, protect Europeans online and to manage our borders better. The G20 must remain united on tackling terrorism. The EU will welcome a G20 Action Plan on Countering Terrorism to further enhance cooperation. The EU will advocate for further steps to counter terrorist financing and money laundering, as well as highlighting the critical role of beneficial ownership transparency and supporting efforts to reinforce the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and provide it with adequate resources. The EU will also support joint efforts with the private sector to fight the misuse of the internet and social media for terrorist purposes. Did you know that... \u2022 An Action Plan for strengthening the fight against terrorist financing was adopted by the European Commission in February 2016. As a follow-up, in December 2016, the Commission tabled new proposals to reinforce the EU's legal framework in the areas of money laundering, illicit cash flows and the freezing and confiscation of assets. \u2022 The European Commission adopted the Firearms Directive and has reinforced the control of legally held firearms in the EU, and new rules make it harder to legally acquire high capacity weapons and restrict access to chemical substances that could be used to make home-made explosives. \u2022 A new law on combatting terrorism , proposed immediately after the November 2015 Paris attacks, ensures that terrorism-related offences \u2014 such as travelling abroad to commit a terrorist offence, returning or travelling within the EU for such activities, training for terrorist purposes and the financing of terrorism \u2014 are now criminalised and heavily sanctioned everywhere in Europe. \u2022 Since 7 April 2017, new EU rules ensure that all travellers crossing the EU\u2019s external borders are systematically checked against relevant databases , significantly reducing the chances that people who pose a security threat \u2014 including EU nationals who have travelled abroad for terrorist purposes \u2014 pass the borders unnoticed.

        "G 20 16 \u2022 The EU's Schengen Information System (SIS), the information sharing system for border management and security in Europe, currently contains over 70 million alerts and was consulted 4 billion times in 2016. This represents an increase of more than 1 billion consultations compared to 2015, and an increase of 2 billion consultations compared to 2014. THE SCHENGEN INFORMATION SYSTEM - THE MOST WIDELY USED INFORMATION SHARING SYSTEM FOR BORDER MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY IN EUROPE Contains over 70 million alerts as of 31 December 2016 It was consulted almost 4 billion times in 2016 (100% increase from 2014) \u2022 The EU Internet Referral Unit at Europol scans the web for online terrorist material. It has referred tens of thousands of posts to internet companies. On average, 90% of these posts are then removed. \u2022 Since May 2016, the four major social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft) agreed to follow a common Code of Conduct on countering illegal online hate speech . The EU asked them to take down the majority of illegal content that was flagged to them in less than 24 hours. So far, in 59% of cases, the companies remove illegal content flagged to them. \u2022 At least 80% of European companies have experienced at least one cybersecurity incident over the last year and the number of security incidents across all industries worldwide rose by 38% in 2015. By September 2017, the Commission will complete its review of the 2013 EU Cybersecurity Strategy so as to bring forward new targeted actions to address risks, improve security and increase the confidence and trust of businesses and citizens in the digital economy and society.

The EU will participate actively in the G20 work, and seek to create synergies with its own initiatives in Africa, notably the External Investment Plan. The EU played an important role in shaping the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which aims to eradicate poverty and hunger as part of 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The EU has a strong starting position when it comes to sustainable development and is fully committed to be a frontrunner in implementing the 2030 Agenda.
