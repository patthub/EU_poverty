        "T R A I N I N G NEW SKILLS ROMANIA Romania is deploying ESF funds to give its people the jobs and skills they need to benefi t from the modernisation of its economy and convergence to EU liv- ing standards. Projects are addressing a wide range of activities, from educa- tion and training to helping the young, older workers and women gain access to work and careers. And Romania is building a fairer society with focused eff orts to help poor, rural populations and its Roma citizens to have the same opportunities for education and jobs as everyone else. AND THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND THE ESF IN ROMANIA: SOME EXAMPLES Quality and equality in education In their fi ght against discrimination and social exclusion, education is a powerful weapon for the Roma \u2013 empowering people to take part in normal working life by giving them the skills and qualifi cations to do so and ensuring the Roma community has the successful role models it needs for the future. The \u2018Quality in education \u2013 a step to equality\u2019 project applied an intercultural curriculum in 40 kindergartens covering 800 children. For the youngest Roma children from more traditional communities who only speak Romani, the project off ered help to ease the transition into kindergarten and avoid them dropping out later. Pre-school attendance of Roma children is very low and drop- out rates from primary and secondary schools are very high. With ESF help, the Amare Rromentza NGO helped change this situation and encourage young Roma to gain a complete education. Creating chances for women, changing attitudes to women Romanian women living in rural, agricultural com- munities o(cid:3) en face limited job opportunities, a situation made worse by traditional attitudes to gender role models and poverty rates three times higher than in urban areas. To improve this situation, the \u2018Better Future for Women\u2019 project promoted a more active role for disadvantaged women in their local economies by helping them set up and manage their own businesses and asso- ciations \u2013 an approach guided by similar projects in Spain. Around 700 potential female entrepre- neurs received counselling and training in business, fi nance, entrepreneurship, project management and community-work skills. The project encour- aged them to establish community organisations which can act as catalysts to change attitudes to women and work and help raise living standards and female employment in these rural areas.

        "M I C R O - F I N A N C E NET WOR KING The Romanian economy is forecast to see accel- erating economic growth as it exits the crisis, and the government is using this opportunity to boost the \u2018catch-up\u2019 process with the more developed EU economies. In this eff ort, issues of employment and social inclusion are playing a major role as, to ensure sustainable growth, Romania must help more of its citizens gain access to the labour mar- ket, and must equip them with the skills they need to share in the benefi ts of a growing and modern- ising economy. Furthermore, jobs and education are at the core of eff orts to build a more inclusive society. Romania aims to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and social inclusion by 580 000 by 2020. So it is creating more opportun- ities for the young, women and older people \u2013 who fi nd it more diffi cult to fi nd work \u2013 and also for disadvantaged groups, in particular the Roma and rural populations who need substantial support if they are not to miss out on the benefi ts of growth and convergence towards EU living standards. These eff orts involve using active employment policies to create sustainable job opportunities, such as helping workers from declining indus- tries to train for the jobs that are in demand, and promoting jobs in the developing cra(cid:3) s and tourism sectors in rural areas. In addition, Romania is taking steps to improve the per- formance of its public administration \u2013 which is vital for the eff ective implementation of its investment programmes for jobs and growth. ESF spending in Romania For 2007-2013, Romania is receiving EUR 3.68 bil- lion in ESF funding. With national co-funding, this brings the total ESF spending on jobs and social inclusion to over EUR 4.3 billion. Spending priori- ties are focused on a wide range of activities to boost employment, off er fairer access to employ- ment, education and training, social inclusion and the quality of public services. INVESTING IN PEOPLE AND JOBS: THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ROMANIA Boosting employment Romania is using ESF funds to provide a broad range of active employment projects using voca- tional training and other measures to help more people get work and develop careers. These pro- jects are reaching around 900 000 people a year \u2013 many of them young people, women, the long- term unemployed and older workers \u2013 and of these, each year, over one-third are fi nding work. For example, new childcare facilities for 1 000 chil- dren in Bucharest allow young parents and women to fi nd work while providing skilled jobs for carers. Likewise, the Olt County employment agency pro- vided training for 1 500 job-seekers in fi elds such as health-spa, sport and agro-tourism. Better jobs Other projects are building skills, such as a quali- fi cation and training programme for 1 900 railway employees giving them the skills to improve service quality and reliability, to help interoperability with the EU rail system, and to encourage a culture of lifelong learning. And there is help for workers in declining industrial sectors, such as that off ered by several companies in southern Romania to retrain 100 recently unemployed energy-sector workers by giving new skills to work in the growing renewable energy sector. Nationwide, Romania has launched an awareness-raising campaign on television and radio accompanied by a travelling road-show to encourage people to take up vocational training opportunities to improve their employability \u2013 over 5 million people have been reached so far. Promoting inclusion Many projects are addressing the challenges fac- ing precarious rural populations who have few opportunities, including many Roma groups who also face discrimination. For example, a project which established three regional entrepreneur- ship centres off ered training and guidance to rural inhabitants in order to encourage new businesses. Projects helping the Roma concentrate on the multi ple challenges facing this group. The National Roma Agency is running ESF projects to help over 20 000 Roma fi ght social exclusion and fi nd work. For example, they are providing scholarships for Roma medical students and support for 500 Roma schoolchildren considering a medical career. Other projects are encouraging Roma children to com- plete school education \u2013 for example, by including Roma-specifi c courses on language and history. Better public services ESF projects are helping public servants improve their skills and competences to achieve a switch from passive functions \u2013 such as registration and payments \u2013 towards active involvement in employment measures and initiatives to better serve the wider public. Examples include a project that implemented a certifi ed quality manage- ment system in eight municipalities in Brasov and Covasna counties. Over 380 staff received training with the aim of improving the services on off er to the public. Likewise, in Caras-Severin county a one-stop shop for a range of public services covering 75 villages was set up to provide a fl ex- ible and effi cient contact point for local citizens.
