I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) RESOLUTIONS COUNCIL Resolution of the Council and of the representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on the overview of the structured dialogue with young people on youth participation in democratic life in Europe (2012/C 380/01) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE REPRESEN­ TATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES, I. RECALLING THAT: 1. The Council Resolution on a renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010- 2018) ( 1 ) recognised all young people as a resource to society and highlighted the importance of upholding the right of young people to participate in the development of policies affecting them by means of a continuous structured dialogue with young people and youth organi­ sations. 2. The Resolution of 19 May 2011 ( 2 ) of the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on the structured dialogue with young people on youth employment, stated that the overall thematic priority for European cooperation in the youth field for the second 18- month work cycle (the period 1 July 2011-31 December 2012) is youth participation with special emphasis on participation in democratic life in Europe. II. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT: 3. The structured dialogue is a participatory bottom-up process and the outcome of the second 18-month work cycle is based on the results achieved by the national consultations during the Polish, Danish and Cyprus Presidencies, as well as the EU Youth Conferences in Warsaw in September 2011, Sorø in March 2012 and Nicosia in September 2012. 4. In the second cycle of the structured dialogue, national consultations were held in all the 27 Member States and a great number of youth leaders and young people were directly involved in the process ( 3 ). In addition, contributions were received from other stakeholders, including international non-governmental youth organi­ sations. 5. The Commission is adapting and developing the European Youth Portal to make it useful and accessible for all young people, from all across Europe. A section has been added to the European Youth Portal with the outcomes of the European Youth Conferences and another section with information on structured dialogue ( 4 ). 6. The specific priority for the Polish Presidency was to increase the cooperation between young people from the European Union and youth from Eastern Europe and Caucasus countries with particular regard to youth mobility and participation. There was also a focus on the role of promotion and validation of informal and non-formal learning for young people. 7. Under the Polish Presidency, the Council agreed to continue fostering youth cooperation between the EU and Eastern Partnership countries ( 5 ). Over the period 2012-2013, additional funds were made available by the Commission in order to increase the number of ‘Youth in Action’ projects and participants from the six neighbouring partner countries of the Eastern Part­ nership under the Eastern Partnership Youth Window ( 6 ).

8. The specific priority for the Danish Presidency was fostering young people’s creativity, innovative capacity and talent as a tool for their active participation in society and increased employability on the labour market. In this regard, participation was seen in the broad sense, which includes young people's participation in representative democracy and civil society at all levels. 9. Under the Danish Presidency the Council invited the Member States and the Commission to establish a thematic expert group with the participation of national experts appointed by Member States under the principle of the open method of coordination with the objective to share good practices on how to promote the creativity and innovative capacity of young people by identifying competences and skills acquired through non-formal and informal learning relevant for employability. 10. The specific priority for the Cyprus Presidency was to promote youth participation and social inclusion of all young people, with emphasis on the inclusion of young people with a migrant background. Strengthening the participation of youth organisations and all young people in social and democratic life, especially in decision-making, was highlighted as an important factor for the creation of inclusive, democratic and pros­ perous societies. The purpose was to promote the inclusion of all young people in the wider social and democratic life through their active participation. 11. The Joint EU Youth Report which evaluates the progress made towards the overall objectives of the renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018) and includes the first two work cycles of the structured dialogue was adopted on 27 November 2012. III. TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRUCTURED DIALOGUE PROCESS: The following issues have emerged from the structured dialogue process: Inclusivity of the process 12. The process of the structured dialogue empowers young people and gives them an opportunity to be active citizens and part of the democratic life. Therefore young people should be involved in all stages of the structured dialogue, from setting the priorities of each Presidency to monitoring the follow-up and evaluating the implementation of the dialogue outcomes. Whereas the decision on the priorities remains within the competence of the Council and the Member States. Incoming Team Presidencies should engage in early consultation with youth representatives and the European Commission prior to proposing the overall thematic priorities to be pursued during cycles of structured dialogue. 13. The work of the national working groups towards the joint objective of consistent and increased participation of young people, especially from different backgrounds, in the structured dialogue process should be supported. National working groups should be sufficiently inclusive in their composition to ensure a participatory process open to all young people. 14. The guiding questions of the structured dialogue should be formulated in an understandable way with the aim of facilitating the national working groups to reach more young people. Enhancement of the cross-sectoral approach 15. For the improvement of the consultation process and its monitoring, the participation of other experts at local, regional, national and European level in the national working groups should be promoted, depending on the relevant thematic priority of the structured dialogue ( 1 ). Moreover, the results of the structured dialogue should be disseminated to cross- sectorial stakeholders. There should be a clear role for youth researchers of the process. Political follow-up and visibility 16. The political follow-up of the results of the structured dialogue and their implementation should be enhanced ( 2 ). 17. The link between the outcomes of the structured dialogue and policy-making in the youth field at national and European level should be stressed, made clearer and better communicated by all actors from the beginning and during the whole process. 18. Measures and initiatives should be taken to enhance the visibility and recognition of the structured dialogue process at local, regional, national and European level. The European Youth Portal should be further developed to enhance the visibility of the process. Sustainability of the process 19. The EU Youth Conference should be strengthened as a forum for structured dialogue between all young people, youth organisations and policy-makers with a view to reaching tangible political outcomes. Where possible, the involvement of youth researchers should be promoted. 20. The European Commission, in close coordination with youth stakeholders, should ensure the organisation of a dialogue with the main actors of structured dialogue as an integral part of future European Youth Weeks. EN C 380/2 Official Journal of the European Union 11.12.2012 ( 1 ) According to the EU Youth Report 2012, only six EU countries have other national ministries playing an active role in the National Working Group. ( 2 ) According to the EU Youth Report 2012, 11 EU countries took initiatives to follow up the results of the structured dialogue of the first cycle. 
21. Without prejudice to negotiations on the future multi­ annual financial framework, sustainable support for the structured dialogue should be ensured. IV. TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS TO ENHANCE YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE IN EUROPE: The following points deriving from the joint recommen­ dations of the Youth Conferences in Warsaw, Sorø and Nicosia, were raised as priority areas on the overarching priority of youth participation in democratic life. 22. Youth participation in decision-making procedures at all levels should be supported and promoted by using new methods and instruments, such as social media and e-participation possibilities. 23. Youth organisations, youth information and counselling structures and professional youth work should be recognised as channels for developing the skills and competences of young people, especially those with fewer opportunities. 24. Awareness of common European values should be raised through expanding the structured dialogue to all young people, including specific target groups, such as non-organised youth and young people with fewer opportunities. 25. The support of youth activities at all levels that focus on the participation and intercultural dialogue of young people from EU and non-EU countries should be strengthened. 26. It is essential to establish youth facilities guided by youth workers, where all young people, including non-organised youth and young people with fewer opportunities, can meet, create and get involved in projects. V. INVITE THE MEMBER STATES AND/OR THE COMMISSION, WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SPHERES OF COMPETENCE AND WITH DUE REGARD FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY, TO: 27. Take due account of the above proposals emerging from the structured dialogue aiming at evaluation and further development of the structured dialogue process and the enhancement of youth participation in democratic life in Europe. VI. AGREE THAT: 28. The EU Youth Report 2012 provides information about the challenges of social inclusion of young people, with reference to the relevant EU youth indicators. It high­ lights that the group of young people mainly at risk of poverty and social exclusion are the so-called NEETs (young people not in employment, education and training) and indicates that in the EU-27, the at-risk- of-poverty or social exclusion rate for young people stands at 29,1 % and is higher than that of the general population (23,5 %). This illustrates the importance of paying special attention to this segment of the population and setting social inclusion as a priority in the youth field. 29. The overall thematic priority for the structured dialogue with young people and youth organisations for the next work cycle (the period 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2014) is therefore social inclusion. The specific priorities for the Team Presidency of the third work cycle are set out in Annex. 30. The priority areas chosen can be complemented by each Presidency in the light of any possible new devel­ opments. 31. The priority areas for the following Team Presidency cycle (1 July 2014-31 December 2015) should be defined before the beginning of its term. EN 11.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 380/3 
ANNEX Priorities for European cooperation in the youth field during the period 1 January 2013-30 June 2014 Overall priority — social inclusion The overall thematic priority for European cooperation in the youth field for the period 1 January 2013-30 June 2014 will be social inclusion. During these 18 months, this topic will be discussed in the framework of the structured dialogue. Specific priorities should, wholly or partially, contribute to the overall thematic. Ireland, Lithuania and Greece will work together to ensure support for the overall theme of social inclusion via their national priorities during their respective Presidency tenures and throughout the 18-month Trio. The concept of social inclusion will be as a broad unifying theme, involving all young people, in addition to those with fewer opportunities. The term and concept of social inclusion will therefore be considered and applied in the broadest sense and will be seen to accommodate, and be inclusive of, the range of issues young people face. 1 January 2013-30 June 2013 — Quality youth work The Irish Presidency will focus on the contribution of quality youth work to enhancing the social inclusion of all young people. During the first half of 2013, the following issues will be highlighted: — contribution of quality youth work to young people's development and well-being, — contribution of quality standards in youth work as a means of achieving positive outcomes for young people in areas such as personal and social development, educational and vocational readiness etc., — contribution of youth work to achieving the goals of ‘Europe 2020’, in particular in relation to employment for youth, — exchange of good practices and sharing of knowledge in these areas among Member States. 1 July 2013-31 December 2013 — Young people not in employment, education and training During the second half of 2013, the following issues will be highlighted: — enhancing the social inclusion of young people, with particular emphasis on young people not in employment, education and training (NEETs), — promoting cross-sectoral cooperation as the underlying principle of integral youth policy, — exchanging good practices on social inclusion of young people, — promoting cooperation in the youth policy field between young people from European Union and Eastern Europe and Caucasus countries. 1 January 2014-30 June 2014 — Culture and entrepreneurship During the first half of 2014, the following issues will be highlighted: — drawing actions to strengthen young people’s entrepreneurial spirit, promote youth entrepreneurship, with special focus on social entrepreneurship, and ‘green jobs’ and new job opportunities in the field of culture to foster the social inclusion of all young people, — increasing accessibility of young people, particularly of those living in remote areas, to new technologies to empower youth talent and attract interest in the field of culture, — promoting the contribution of youth work to support and enhance the creativity and entrepreneurship of young people, including the exchange of good practices.

6 1 . E U a p p r o a c h t o e v a l u a t i o n o f R D p r o g r a m m e s 1. EU approach to evaluation of RD programmes In recent years the evaluation of EU co- founded programmes was assigned particular importance. After the administrative reform of the European Community (Agenda 2000) a periodic evaluation has been extended to all EU policies (Toulemonde et. al., 2002) and recognized as a crucial component of policy development. At the same time evaluation practice became an integral part of EU programming at all levels, e.g. EU, national, and territorial, etc. (Vanhove, 1999; Ederveen, 2003; EC, 1999, 2001, 2002a, 2002b). According to EU definition, programme evaluation is a process that culminates in a judgment (or assessment) of policy interventions according to their results, impacts and the needs they aim to satisfy 1 . In case of structural and rural development (RD) programmes EU regulations distinguish between ex-ante, mid-term, ex-post and on-going evaluations. Ex-ante evaluations aim at the optimisation of the allocation of the budgetary resources’ and the improvement of the quality of programming by answering the question: what impacts can be expected from a newly designed policy intervention?, the main purpose of mid-term and ex-post evaluations of EU programmes is to examine the effects (i.e. results/impacts) of a given programme and to learn about: • The programme’s effectiveness, i.e. the degree to which a program produced the desired outcome (the assessment of a programme’s effectiveness implies a pre- definition of operationally defined objectives and their achievement criteria ), and 1 See: Evaluating EU activities – A practical guide for the Commission Services, DG Budget, July 2004. • The programme’s efficiency, i.e. the degree to which overall program benefits relate to its costs. Evaluation literature defines impacts as direct/indirect and intended/unintended effects (economic, social, environmental and others) of a given policy intervention (e.g. development project, programme, policy measure, policy) occurred at various levels , i.e. individual, collective or societal and/or local, regional, country, global, etc (i.e. at all possible levels of a “result chain”). 2 In contrast, EU evaluation methodology strictly differentiates between programme outputs (physical units), programme results (effects occurred at a micro- level) and programme impacts , whereby the last are defined as: medium/long-term effects of intervention beyond the immediate effects on direct beneficiaries of the programme that can be observed at local community, regional- or macro- economic, country (programme area) or global levels 3,4 . Following the EU definition, impacts are summative programme outcomes consisting of: a) direct effects on programme beneficiaries (including deadweight loss and leverage effects), and b) indirect programme effects (e.g. substitution, displacement, multiplier, etc.) that occurred at regional, programme area or national levels. From a policy point of view, impact assessment of a given policy intervention is important as: 2 While analysis of impacts usually distinguishes direct, indirect and induced impacts, definition of impacts differs according to EU terminology vs. World Bank, general evaluation or NONIE terminologies. 3 Rural Development 2007-2013. Handbook on common monitoring and evaluation framework, Guidelines note N. Glossary of terms, EC, 2006 4 In contrast, World Bank, NONIE and other general evaluation guidelines define ”impact” broader, by including also direct effects of a given policy intervention at beneficiary level.

It also provides information about the sustainability of effects of a given policy intervention. • A comparison of a policy intervention’s results with target values provides information on the effectiveness of a given policy intervention and on the achievability of more general societal goals (e.g. concerning growth or development) using this specific policy instrument. • It helps to re-design a policy intervention (programme) to make it more effective and efficient (by taking into consideration costs of intervention). • It provides arguments for continuation or discontinuation of policies/programmes by comparing social benefits with costs of specific policy interventions. • It helps to learn about the functioning of economic, social and environmental processes. • It improves institutional capacities of organisations involved in impact evaluations. • It improves decision making at all levels. • It provides some information regarding accountability of institutions involved in the formulation and implementation of policies. As the evidence for impacts is usually provided on the basis of impact indicators, any appropriate impact assessment should reveal the extent to which observed changes in pre-selected impact indicators (computed at the regional- or macro-levels) came about due to programme activities. Keeping this in mind, the key challenges of an effective impact assessment of RD programmes carried out at the regional or macro-levels are: Firstly , determining true causation 5 , i.e. verifying that an observed change (at micro- or regional levels) of a certain phenomenon (impact indicator) that might be theoretically (!) associated with a given policy (whole or in part) can indeed be attributed (as a whole or partly) to (or is caused by) this policy intervention. In order to verify the above supposition, effects of other intervening factors, (i.e. exogenously determined) which may also influence an observable phenomenon (impact indicator) have to be separated (“netted out”) from the effects of this given policy intervention 6. Such a separation of programme effects from other factors requires a construction of an appropriate counterfactual base-line scenario (a situation without the programme in place). Secondly , aggregation of various effects of a programme. A summative evaluation of an RD programme’s impact should ideally embrace all important programme effects in economic, social, environmental, etc., RD domains and not focus on some programme outcomes only, in form of selected impact indicators (e.g. value added, employment, etc). This can be done by: a) carefully stating the hypothesized effects; b) identifying various possible intended and unintended; direct and indirect; or positive and negative effects that might be caused by a RD programme; c) defining respective measurement criteria; d) defining appropriate time periods to be analysed; and e) systematically monitoring programme implementation. Furthermore, the aggregation of overall programme effects can only be carried out once a consistent weighting system (for individual 5 Causation cannot be proved through a simple correlation analysis. 6 In some evaluations of policy intervention, “impacts” are “identified” as a degree to which certain policy/societal goals (usually pre-defined prior to a policy intervention) have been achieved, after policy intervention. This approach is however not defendable. In fact, certain policy/ general societal goals can be achieved without a specific policy intervention via other (policy independent) factors. In this example, an objective of an impact analysis would be inter alia a verification of causality between a degree to which policy goals were achieved (and measured by specific impact indicators) and a given policy intervention

Thirdly , a comprehensive quantitative programme impact evaluation should involve a cost-benefit analysis (including an assessment of the programme’s private and social costs and benefits) to be carried out via aggregation and weighting of all partial benefits and costs linked to a given programme. In order to facilitate evaluations of RD programmes (and ensure a standardized evaluation approach) a common evaluation framework to EU RD programmes was developed by EC (DG-AGRI) 7 . The core element of the EC evaluation framework are Common Evaluation Questions (CEQ) (pre-defined by EC) and programme specific questions (defined by national programme authorities), both to be answered by external programme evaluators. Answering the EC common evaluation questions (CEQ) requires using the concept of “intervention logic,” pre-defined by EC, i.e. differentiating between programme inputs, outputs, results, and impacts (by moving from a micro-level to regional- or country levels). Among dozens of various evaluation questions included in the evaluation guidelines for EU RD programmes implemented in the years 2000-2006 important CEQs concerned an overall effect of implemented policies (e.g. impact on the quality of life) 8 . While impacts of RD programmes at a regional/macro level can occur at various RD 7 European Commission Agriculture Directorate-General, “Guidelines for the Mid-Term Evaluations of Rural Development Programmes 2000-2006 Supported from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,” 2002; European Commission DG AGRI, “Guidelines for the mid-term evaluation of rural development programmes funded by SAPARD 2000-2006,” 2002.; EC, “Rural Development 2007-2013.

Glossary of terms, September 2006. http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/rurdev/ eval/guidance/note_n_en.pdf 8 An example of a relevant CEQ can be: “To what extent has a given RD measure/programme contributed to improving of the quality of live in rural areas”. The answer to this and other CEQ are to be provided in quantitative terms. domains (economic, social or environmental) programme evaluators were asked to: • derive their findings using various partial indicators describing the potential programme’s impact at various RD domains (e.g. economic, environment, etc.) and, • assess programme net effects by comparing these indicators with respective common indicators/performance standards. The above guidelines have been followed in all evaluation studies of RD programmes implemented during 2000-2006. Yet, many empirical impact evaluations, due to their methodological weaknesses, appeared to be insufficiently rigorous and stringent to serve as a guide to policies. Clearly, application of inadequate methodologies (e.g. naive methods or absence of control group assessments) for evaluations of programme impacts may lead a number of negative consequences: • Obtained evaluation results may be heavily biased in both directions (negative or positive). In an extreme situation, results obtained from programme evaluations may substantially differ from real programme impacts (a qualitative difference!). • Lack of appropriate knowledge about the real impacts of the programme may encourage implementation programmes which, due to their low effectiveness/efficiency, should be discontinued or substantially re-designed. • Indirect effects of a programme in question may have a decisive impact on the sign of calculated programme net effects. In extreme situations, negative side effects (e.g. economic, environmental, social, etc.) of badly designed RD programmes may impede development of rural areas. Impact methodologies which do not embrace

Lack of knowledge about real programme impacts may reinforce those negative developments. • Insufficient learning about the real programme effects may call into question the credibility of EU evaluations and the institutions involved (conclusions of evaluation reports can be used selectively to support the interest of particular groups or can be contested where the evaluation does not conclude in their favour).

The main methodological problems in evaluation studies carried out at macro- and/or regional levels Numerous ex-post evaluation studies carried out at the regional and macro-levels confirm the existence of huge methodological difficulties faced by evaluators of RD programmes when attempting to: i) Provide an empirical evidence of a true cause-and-effect link between the change in selected impact indicators and the RD programme; ii) Disentangle for each separate impact indicator (economic, social or environmental) the effect of the RD programme from other exogenously determined factors; iii) Aggregate and measure the overall effect of an RD programme; and iv) Perform cost-benefit analysis of the programme. The major causes of the above difficulties are: • Extensive use of traditional evaluation techniques . Typically, the changes in selected impact indicators (collected at a regional- or macro-level) observed by programme evaluators depend on a number of other (i.e. programme independent) factors (e.g. economy-wide factors, community and household characteristics, social and physical infrastructure activities carried out and supported by other programmes). In this context, calculation of the net effect of a given RD programme, i.e. disentangling the effect of a program support from other exogenously determined factors at the regional/macro level definitely cannot be carried out using traditional “naïve” evaluation techniques (e.g. after- before methods). As programme effects cannot be directly observed (see: Chapter 3.1 below) the calculation of a programme impact at a regional- or macro-level requires the application of rigid modern evaluation methodologies and an obligatory construction of appropriate counterfactuals (i.e. base-line scenario) (an area which until recently was almost completely ignored by evaluators of RD programmes). • Aggregation problems and unclear interpretation in case of opposite or dissimilar effects . In the majority of cases, effects of a given RD programme in a rural region are multidimensional, i.e. even a single programme measure (e.g. investment in agricultural holdings) can simultaneously affect various RD domains, e.g. production, income, investment, employment, competitiveness, environment, technical and social infrastructure, etc. Additionally, many RD programme measures can have both intended (usually expected by policy makers) and unintended effects . For example, investments in rural infrastructure or in processing facilities, along with some positive effects (e.g. increase of labour productivity), may bring about negative environmental impacts, including potential loss of land supporting biodiversity, protected habitats and/or species, deterioration of soil, water environment and air quality, etc. Similarly, support of local food processors may lead to negative effects in the form of strengthening local monopolies (e.g. large processors), causing breakdown of other local food processing businesses, and therefore a decrease of employment and income in non-supported local enterprises, an increase of out-migration, etc.; some investments in irrigation may cause depletion of water 
11 C o u n t e r f a c t u a l i m p a c t e v a l u a t i o n o f E U r u r a l d e v e l o p m e n t p r o g r a m m e s - P r o p e n s i t y S c o r e M a t c h i n g m e t h o d o l o g y . . . resources in other areas, etc.; support provided to certain type of agricultural producers may have negative effects on on- supported population, etc. In all these cases an assessment of an overall impact using pre-selected common impact indicators may be (even for a single RD measure!) rather unmanageable as various effects (positive and negative, expressed in the form of partial indicators) can only with difficulty be compared and/or aggregated (social weights of individual effects in various RD domains e.g. economic, social and environmental are usually unknown). In this context, the partial impact indicators (7 common and 15 additional impact indicators) proposed in the new EC evaluation guidelines for the assessment of an overall net-impact of a RD programme seems to be problematic. • Use of average performance standards . If programme impacts are the main objects of policy concern, reliance on average (regional or country’s) performance indicators/ standards as proxy for the functioning of a programme control group can be very problematic. Numerous studies showed that a country’s average common performance measures (e.g. average employment rates, growth of income etc.) may not adequately represent a counterfactual situation (i.e. a situation without the programme in place). The evaluation literature suggests that performance standards cannot substitute an econometric impact evaluation based on a comparable control group. • Ineffective monitoring system . The use of various indicators targeting potential effects of specific measures is in practice not possible without having an effective monitoring system (which has to be set up prior to the programme). Yet, the learning about the overall programme effects depends upon which (of the possible many) partial indicators are pre-selected and included into the monitoring system. By not including certain indicators, many important impacts (positive/ negative) can be overseen. In order to avoid such situation, a right and timely pre-selection of various partial monitoring indicators and institutional capacity building of monitoring institutions are of crucial importance. • Increasing complexity of RD policies , both in terms of the number of programmes as well as number of applied measures, obviously calls for a multi-dimensionality of evaluation exercise. Given this complexity, estimation of an overall effect of all programme measures (e.g. the effect of the programme support on the quality of life of the beneficiary population) that may simultaneously influence economic, social and environmental domains of rural development requires combination of rigid evaluation methodologies with techniques allowing for a consistent aggregation of impacts by all measures. Obviously, the key issue in evaluation of programme impacts (as well as results) is a construction of an appropriate counterfactual. Taking this as a basic criterion, methods used in programme impact evaluations can be divided in four groups (Baker, World Bank 2000; Kapoor, World Bank 2002): 1. Approaches with no counterfactual (e.g. qualitative studies that assess effects of the programme before, during, and after policies are implemented through focus groups, interviews, and other qualitative techniques; “Before and After,” methods which compare the performance of key variables during and after a program with those prior to the programme.) 2. Approaches that generate counterfactuals through multiple assumptions (e.g. Computable general equilibrium models (CGEs), regional econometric models, or regional input-output models that attempt to contrast outcomes in treatment and 
12 2 . T h e m a i n m e t h o d o l o g i c a l p r o b l e m s i n e v a l u a t i o n s t u d i e s c a r r i e d o u t a t m a c r o - a n d / o r r e g i o n a l . . . comparison groups through simulations. While all of these approaches have numerous weaknesses CGE models can produce outcomes for the counterfactual. 3. “Naive” approaches which compare the observed changes in selected performance indicators in a sample of programme areas with arbitrary selected comparison groups. 4. Statistical/econometric methods that control for the differences in initial conditions and policies (both at micro- as well as macro/ regional levels). Unfortunately, in the majority of studies concerned with the quantitative assessment of socio-economic impacts of RD programmes in EU countries (programming period 2000- 2006) “naïve” approaches were employed as a basic evaluation methodology. While in some evaluation studies the authors attempted to build on counterfactuals, in most cases comparisons between supported and non-supported units or areas were done without any consideration for appropriate matching. Usually, comparison groups were selected arbitrarily, leading to quantitative results that were statistically biased (i.e. selection bias). In the majority of qualitative evaluations, knowledge about a specific programme’s indirect effects (e.g. substitution, displacement, multiplier, etc.) was “imputed” on the basis of anecdotal evidence or ad hoc surveys of a group of beneficiaries, opinions of administrative officials, etc. 9 Furthermore, in approximately 75% of Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) studies submitted to European Commission by the end of 2010 the impacts of EU RD programmes were assessed without any reference to a counterfactual situation (see: EC, European Commission, 2011). 9 .See CEAS, 2003. These techniques, in a combination with the most popular “naïve” approach to answering CEQ questions (e.g. the before and after approach) appear as particularly problematic. Taking into consideration that in the programming period of 2007-2013 in each individual EU rural region: • The number of potentially applicable RD measures under an RD programme can be very large (currently up to 42 RD measures can be applied); • Specific RD measures implemented under specific RD programme will probably affect a wide range of various rural development domains (e.g. economic, environmental, social, etc.); and • Only seven common partial impact indicators have been proposed to be used for the analysis of impacts of RD programmes (e.g. no common environmental impact indicators are proposed to be used in evaluations of RD measures under Axis 1 and Axis 3; no common economic impact indicators are proposed to be used in evaluations of RD measures under Axis 2); it is understandable that the assessment of an overall impact of an RD programme at regional or macro-levels requires an application of a more comprehensive and rigid methodological approaches.

Advanced empirical approaches Concerning the use of methodological approaches for impact-analyses of RD/structural programmes that enable construction of counterfactuals , the practical possibilities are as follows: 1. The first possibility is to integrate a micro- economic approach (e.g. micro economic individual behaviour or household models) into various local or regional models (e.g. Input-output, Social Accounting Matrix or CGE) and assess the impact of a programme on the base of these combined models (e.g. micro-simulation models with local/regional CGE, village CGE, etc.). The main advantage from the use of these models is a theoretical possibility to estimate both anticipated as well as non-anticipated effects; direct effects (at the beneficiary level) and indirect effects (generated from supply of materials, goods and services attributable to other linked and not directly benefiting units and/or industries located in the same area as well as induced effects (i.e. multiplier effects) of a given programme generated through direct and indirect activities (including consumption, taxes, etc.) of a given policy in question (above models are subject to consistency checks through micro-macro consistency equations). The main disadvantages of these models are: i) input-output models assume that technological/ economic relationships are fixed over time and do not respond to price/cost changes; ii) while input-output tables are normally available at relatively high aggregation levels their rescaling to a local level requires a usage of various (often non-transparent) procedures which can be divided in three main categories: “survey”, “non-survey” and “hybrid” approaches, e.g. location quotient approach (Del Corpo, et. Al, 2008); iii) commonly applied CGE models usually do not show a detailed enough level of sector disaggregation (a major problem in evaluating RD policies) and are usually static (by contrast, multi-sector and regional dynamic CGE models are much more complex and time consuming in their construction and are therefore very rarely applied to policy evaluations at regional levels); iv) empirical CGE modelling at regional level often is often impossible due to the lack of relevant statistical data at the local or regional level; v) in CGE modelling a heterogeneity of firm behaviour is largely ignored. Despite these deficiencies, micro-macro models are increasingly applied to policy analysis and include a whole array of respective techniques, starting with the simpler macro models that use representative household groups to link macro economic policies and microeconomic data, to more complex top-down modelling frameworks that combine (top) macro models and (down) micro-simulation models (Bourguignon, et al. 2008). 2. The second possibility is to use standard regional input-output econometric models (e.g. REMI, IMPLAN, RIMS II or EMSI) in regional policy analysis to estimate direct, indirect and induced effects of a given policy. For example, the REMI model, that has been in a continuous development since the 1980s integrates input-output, CGE and economic geography methodologies. It consists of thousands of simultaneous equations and its structure consists of five major interrelated blocks: (1) Output, (2) Labor and Capital Demand, (3) Population and Labor Supply, (4) Wages, Prices, and Costs, and (5) Market Shares. The REMI model was applied in numerous studies of economic development in the US and Europe, e.g. for the evaluation of land use and growth controls, impact of investments in energy sectors, transportation, 
14 3 . A d v a n c e d e m p i r i c a l a p p r o a c h e s etc; for the evaluation of regional economic effects of investments in the EU (Treyz F. and G, Treyz, 2002); and recently for an ex-ante evaluation of RDP in Tuscany until 2020 (REMI-IRPET) (Felici, et. al, 2008). The recently extensively used IMPLAN model (the computer software and data-package is available from the Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc.) is a computer software package that consists of procedures for estimating local input-output models and associated databases. A Description of the EMSI model is available in: Galloway, H. EMSI’s Input- Output Model Multipliers: A Brief Overview and Comparison with Other Major Models, www.economicmodeling.com. Extensive comparison of multipliers used in the REMI, IMPLANT and RIMS II models is available in: Rickman and Schwer, 1995. Yet, the applicability of these models the context of EU policies evaluation raises several concerns. Firstly, it is not quite clear how a number of US economic parameters used in these models can be applied to the EU reality, given different economic and social context in both economies (including problems with data classification and consistency) (comp. Wilson R. in: OECD, 2004); Secondly, modification of these models to reflect local circumstances is usually a considerable and highly time consuming effort that cannot be undertaken by a few external evaluators alone, but requires a great dose of cooperation with local authorities and local stakeholders; Thirdly, the complexity of use for models like REMI or LEFM undoubtedly requires a certain minimum level of expertise; Fourthly, problems with timeliness of the key data incl. input-output tables raises questions regarding forecasting validity. 3. The third possibility to learn about an effect of the programme at the regional- or macro- level is to use a micro- approach and to aggregate direct and indirect impacts computed at the micro-level by drawing on the principles of controlled experimentation (e.g. quasi-experimental approach). This can be done by measuring an individual response (individuals, households, farms, or areas) in controlled settings. Because the supported groups and the comparison groups may differ in observed and unobserved variables that determine programme outcomes, a simple comparison of outcomes between supported and arbitrary selected non-supported units will not reflect the true effect of the programme. To enable such comparisons various techniques can be applied to find adequate controls (e.g. matching; for details see propensity score techniques below). The next step is to derive some meaningful micro-based policy parameters using available data on units in a given sample, e.g. SATE (sample average treatment effect), SATT (sample average treatment on treated), STNT (sample effect on non-treated) and then (by drawing on probability distributions) estimate aggregated impacts for the population at large, e.g. PATE (population average treatment effect), PATT (population average treatment effect on treated), or ATNT (average treatment effect on non-treated), (see: Imbens and Wooldridge, 2007). In many cases, PATE combined with additional information on general equilibrium effects (including substitution and replacement effects) and programme costs (e.g. administrative costs and social costs) can be helpful in answering the policy question regarding the net programme gain to the region, programme area or economy. 4. The fourth possibility is to use an evaluation technique that is based on the matched comparison of regional units (van de Walle, D., and D. Cratty. 2002; Lokshin and Yemtsov, 2005; Michalek, 2008). Given numerous pros and cons of alternative evaluation methods, it can be particularly advantageous to apply quasi-experimental methods which basically draw on a micro- approach applying it to macro-units (Point 4), i.e. 
15 C o u n t e r f a c t u a l i m p a c t e v a l u a t i o n o f E U r u r a l d e v e l o p m e n t p r o g r a m m e s - P r o p e n s i t y S c o r e M a t c h i n g m e t h o d o l o g y . . . using a technique that is based on counterfactual analysis involving comparison of regional units (van de Walle, D., and D. Cratty. 2002; Lokshin and Yemtsov, 2005; Michalek, 2008). In our study we will follow this approach. The sequence of analytical steps is as follows: Firstly, the Rural Development Index (RDI) will be used as the main synthetic impact indicator (Michalek, 2008) - a proxy describing the overall quality of life in individual rural areas. The weights of economic, social and environmental domains entering the RDI are in our study derived empirically from the econometrically estimated intra- and inter- regional migration function after selecting the “best” model from alternative model specifications (i.e. the panel estimate logistic regression nested error structure model, spatial effect models, etc). Secondly , the impact of RD measures implemented in specific rural regions is analysed by means of selected impact indicators in programme supported regions and control regions, prior to the programme and after it, by applying a combination of the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) (e.g. Kernel matching) and difference-in-differences (DID) methods. Evaluation of programme results at regional levels are performed on the basis of the estimated Average Treatment Effects (ATE), Average Treatment on Treated (ATT) and Average Treatment on Untreated (ATU) effects using the RDI as the main impact indicator. Thirdly , sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum bounds) is carried out in order to assess a possible influence of unobservables on obtained results. Fourthly, given information on regional intensity of programme exposure (financial input flows) the overall impact of the programme support in a selected country is estimated by means of a dose-response function and some derivative dose-response functions under the framework of a generalized propensity score matching (GPS) (Imbens, 2002; Lechner, 2002; Imai and van Dyk, 2002; Hirano and Imbens, 2004). The proposed methodology permits testing a number of common stipulations, e.g. positive effect of a given programme on various indicators of regional performance, e.g. employment, labour productivity, environmental and social indicators, etc.

Applied methodologies for evaluation of programme impacts at a regional/macro level 4.1. Fundamental evaluation problem The main purpose of ex-post evaluation of EU RD programmes is to assess the impact of this policy intervention on regions or programme areas (i ), where the programme was implemented. Similarly as in the case of individuals, the effect of a given EU RD programme on a respective region (or programme area) i can be written as: τ i = Y i (1) – Y i (0) (1) Where: τ i = measures the effect of programme participation on region i, relative to effect of non- participation, on the basis of a response variable Y (impact indicator). Obviously, as τ i measures the effect of programme participation for a given region i , and i is not a subject to any experimental study, only one of the potential outcomes, i.e. either Y i (1) or Y i (0) can be empirically observed for each individual unit/region i . In another words, the fundamental evaluation problem or “fundamental problem of causal inference” arises from the fact that the main policy interest, i.e. the effect of the policy intervention on regions, programme areas, etc. affected by the programme cannot be directly observed in non-experimental evaluation studies (it is physically impossible to observe the value of the response variable ( Y ) for the same unit/ region i under two mutually exclusive states of nature, i.e. participation in the programme and non-participation (T he Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference (FPCI): Holland, 1986; Rubin 1974; Roy, 1951). While the FPCI makes observing causal effects impossible, this does not mean that causal inference is impossible . In fact, determining unobservable outcome in (eq.1) called counterfactual outcome is both possible and feasible (Rubin, 1974; 1975) . The literature has long recognized that impact evaluation is essentially a problem of missing data (Ravallion, 2005; Goldstein, 2007) and determining the counterfactual is widely considered the core of each evaluation design (!) 10 . 4.2. Policy evaluation indicators 4.2.1. Average Treatment Effects (ATE) The first indicator which can be applied for evaluation of RD programmes is the average treatment effect (ATE ). This indicator is simply the difference between the expected outcomes after participation in the RD programme and the outcomes of non-participation conditional on X (Heckman, 1996; Imbens, 2003; Imbens and Wooldridge, 2007). Δ ATE (x) = E ( Δ |X = x) (2) 10 Generally speaking, there are two major methods to determine the counterfactuals, i.e. experimental design and quasi-experimental design. In the experimental design that is generally viewed as the most robust evaluation approach (Burtless, 1995) one would have to create a control group of units which are randomly denied access to a programme. In this random assignment a control group would comprise of firms/units/individuals with identical distribution of observable and unobservable characteristics to those in the supported group. In such an experiment the selection problem would be overcome because participation is randomly determined (see: Bryson, et. al, 2002). Yet, there is a vast literature showing that social experiments (except of in sociology, psychology, etc.) are often too expensive and may require the unethical coercion of subjects unwilling to follow the experimental protocol (see: Winship and Morgan, 1999). As experimental designs (randomization) in case of evaluation of RD programmes would be extremely cumbersome (for ethical and political reasons) a non-random method (quasi- experimental) will be used in this study. The basic idea behind quasi-experimental methods is that they generate comparison groups that are akin to the group of programme participants by using techniques described above.

ATE is the effect of assigning participation randomly to every region i of type X (assuming full compliance and ignoring general equilibrium effects) and describes an expected gain from participating in the RD programme for a randomly selected region i from the joined sub-groups/ regions that participated and those that did not participate in a given RD programme. This policy indicator averages the effect of the programme over all units in the population, including both programme participants and non-participants. The major disadvantage of these indicators is the fact that ATE includes the effect on regions j for which the programme was never intended/ designed (it may include impact on regions that may even be programme ineligible). 4.2.2. Average Treatment on Treated (ATT) The most common policy indicator used for evaluation of programme effects is the average treatment on the treated effect (ATT), i.e. in our case showing the average impact of a given RD programme on those regions i where the programme was implemented. ATT effect can be described as: Δ ATT (x) = E ( Δ |X=x, D=1) (3) which is equivalent to: E (Y1-Y0|D=1) = E (Y1| D =1)–E (Y0|D =1) (3a) ATT can also be defined conditional on P(Z): where P is a probability distribution of observed covariances Z (see: Chapter: 4.3.1.1). Δ ATT (x) = E( Δ |X=x, P(Z)=p, D=1) (3b) As (3a) and (3b) are equivalent, the latter formulation will be applied in our study for calculating effects of a given RD programme. 4.2.3. Average Treatment on the Untreated (ATU) Information about an eventual extension of a given programme to those that were formerly excluded from the programme can be derived on the basis of an average effect on the untreated (ATU) as defined in (3c). E(Y1-Y0|D=0) = E (Y1| D =0)–E (Y0|D =0) (3c) 4.3. Construction of control groups As performance of regions (i) supported by a RD programme cannot be directly observed in a “non-support” situation (a given region cannot simultaneously be subject and not be subject to the same programme) economic performance of RD supported regions in a “non-support” situation has to be simulated, using more advanced techniques. Construction of an appropriate base-line should provide us with an answer to the question: “what would have been a given outcome for regions supported by an RD programme if the programme had not been implemented?”. By comparing outcomes of the performance of supported regions with a control group of regions in two data points; i.e. at the time of support inititaion and after support, we can straightforwardly answer two questions: Q1). What was the effect of exogenously determined factors 11 on the performance of regions which in reality were supported by the programme?, and Q2). What was the effect of the programme support? Obviously, in the context of empirical non- experimental studies the counterfactuals cannot be estimated directly, in a manner analogous to the one based on randomization. The underlying 11 All factors which influence performance of supported and non-supported regions and are not considered as RD programme related can be called exogenous.

One of the difficulties commonly faced during formulation of a relevant base-line is the problem of a perfect comparability (ideally, in case of rural development programmes, the same regions which participated in the programme should also be used for simulation of their performance without the programme). As this is however not feasible, it is important to make comparisons in a manner which guarantees that all basic characteristics of regions in which the RD programme was implemented are as much as possible identical with the characteristics of those regions that did not participate (i.e. the statistical probability of receiving support from RD programmes should be the same for supported and non-supported regions in each comparison group 12 ). 4.3.1. Matching Matching is a method of sampling from a large number of potential controls to produce a control group of modest size in which the distribution of covariates is similar to their distribution in the group of participants. Matching is based on the identifying assumption that conditional on some covariates X, the outcome Y is independent of D. Application of matching to the consistent evaluation of programme effects makes the following two assumptions crucial: 1. Unconfoundedness assumption: Y 0 , Y 1 ┴ D |X 12 See: Part VI: Application of propensity score Where: ┴ denotes independence Unconfoundedness - to yield consistent estimates of the programme impact matching methods assume that the outcome in the counterfactual state is independent of participation, given observable characteristics. This assumption implies, that selection is based solely on observable characteristics and that all variables that influence participation and potential outcomes are observed by the researcher (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). 2. Overlap assumption : 0 < Pr (D =1|X <1 The overlap assumption prevents X from being a perfect predictor in the sense that it is possible to find a counterpart in the non- participant group for each programme participant and vice versa (Caliendo and Hujer, 2005). If there are regions where the support of X does not overlap for the participants and non-participants, matching has to be performed over the common support only (i.e. to avoid a situation of lack of comparable units, one can restrict matching and hence estimation of the effect of programme participation to the region of common support, equivalent to an overlap condition). The overlap condition not only rules out the phenomenon of perfect predictability of D given X but also ensures that units with the same X values have positive probabilities of being both participants and non- participants (see: Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005; Heckman, LaLonde and Smith, 1999). A weaker version of the overlap assumption implies the possible existence of a non-participant similar to each participant 13 . 13 Following Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1998), the importance of overlap assumption can be illustrated on example of a situation where for some values of x we have either p(x) =0 or p(x)=1, i.e. in which one would find some units i with covariates implying that those units either always participate or never participate in the programme. If they always participated there would not have counterparts in the comparison group (non-participants). On the other hand, had they never participated, they would never had counterparts in the group of programme participants.

Conditional on the observables Z, outcomes for the regions which did not participate in a RD programme represent what participating regions would have experienced had they not participated in the RD programme (under the assumption that selection into the RD programme is based entirely on observable characteristics). Various empirical studies show that traditional matching may be rather difficult if the set of conditioning variables Z is large, due to the “curse of dimensionality” of the conditioning problem 14 . Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed that the dimensionality of the conditioning problem can be reduced by implementing matching methods through the use of so-called balancing scores b(Z), i.e. functions of the relevant observed covariates Z such that the conditional distribution of Z given b(Z) is independent of assignment into treatment. One possible balancing score is the propensity score, i.e. the probability of participating in a programme given observed characteristics Z. 4.3.1.1. Propensity score matching Propensity score matching (PSM) (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) is used in our study to predict the probability of receiving support on the basis of observed covariates for both supported and non-supported regions. The method balances the observed covariates between the supported group and a control group based on similarity of their predicted probabilities of receiving support, e.g. from the RD programme. The aim of PSM matching is to find a comparison group of regions from a sample of non-supported regions that is closest (in terms of observed characteristics) to the sample of those regions where an RD programme was implemented. 14 In case Z is if high dimension it is very difficult to find an appropriate match. For example, with just 20 binary covariates, there are 220 or about a million covariate patterns (Rosenbaum, 2004). For random variables Y and Z and for discrete variable D, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) defined the propensity score as a conditional probability of participating in a programme given pre- programme characteristics Z: p(Z) ≡ Pr (D=1|Z) = E(D|Z) where Z is a multidimensional vector of pre-programme characteristics. Rosenbaum and Rubin showed that if the participation in programme is random conditional on Z, it is also random conditional on p(Z): E(D|Y, Pr(D=1|Z)) = E(E(D|Y, Z)|Y, Pr(D=1|Z)) (4a) so that E(D|Y,Z)=E(D|Z)=Pr(D=1|Z) implies E(D|Y, Pr(D=1)|Z))=E(D|Pr(D=1|Z)) (4b) Where: Pr (D=1|Z) is a propensity score In other words when Y0 outcomes are independent from programme participation conditional on Z, they are also independent from participation conditional on the propensity score, Pr (D=1|Z). Conditional independence remains therefore valid if we use the propensity score p(Z) instead of covariates Z or its subset (X). 4.3.2. Matching algorithms As the probability of observing two units with exactly the same value of the propensity score is in principle zero (since p(Z) is a continuous variable) the estimation of desirable programme effects (see below) requires the use of appropriate matching algorithms which define the measure of proximity in order to define programme non- participants who are acceptably close (e.g. in terms of the propensity score) to any given programme participant. The most commonly used matching algorithms are: Nearest Neighbour Matching,

Nearest neighbour matching In this matching method the region j (non- participant) with the value of Pj that is closest to participanting region Pi is selected as the match. C (P i ) = min j |P i - P j | , j є I 0 ( 5 ) Where: P is a propensity score The most prominent variants of nearest matching are i) matching with replacement , i.e. the unit, which did not participate in the programme, can be used more than once as a match; and ii) matching without replacement where respective programme non-participants can match only once. The biggest disadvantage of the nearest neighbour method is that it can result in bad matches if the closest neighbour (the control unit) is placed far away (in terms of the propensity score) from a supported unit. 4.3.2.2. Caliper matching This method is to be considered as a variation of nearest neighbour matching. A match for a firm i is selected only if: | P i – P j | < є , j є I 0 ( 6 ) Where ε is pre-specified tolerance By using caliper matching bad matches can be avoided by imposing a tolerance level on the maximum propensity score distance. The disadvantage of this method is the difficulty to know a priori what tolerance level is reasonable (Smith and Todd, 2005). 4.3.2.3. Kernel matching Kernel matching is defined as: (7) Where: W = weights for i and j G = a kernel function an = the bandwidth. Various kernel functions can be used in applied work, such as the Gaussian, the Epanechnikow, biweight (quartic), triweight or the cosine functions. This non-parametric matching estimator (kernel) is especially interesting as it allows for a match of each programme participant with multiple units in a control group with weights which depend on the distance between the participant observation for which a counterfactual is being constructed and each comparison group observation. In this method weights are inversely proportional to the distance between the propensity scores of participants and controls within the common support level (the further away a comparison unit is from the participant unit, the lower the weight it receives in the computation of the counterfactual outcome). The main advantage of this method is that a lower variance is achieved because more information is used 15 . Another useful property of applying this method is the possibility of using standard bootstrap techniques for estimation of standard errors for matching estimators that generally should not be applied when using nearest neighbour matching (Abadie and Imbens, 2004; Todd, 2006). 15 For systematical analysis of the finite-sample properties of various propensity score matching and weighting estimators through Monte Carlo simulation see: Frölich, 2004b.

Local linear weighting function The local linear weighting function (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd, 1997; Smith and Todd, 2003)) can be defined as: W ( i , j ) = (8) Where: W = weights The difference between kernel matching and local linear matching is that the latter includes in addition to the intercept a linear term in the propensity score of a unit i that participated in the programme. This is an advantage whenever comparison group observations are distributed asymmetrically around the treated observation, e.g. at boundary points, or when there are gaps in the propensity score distribution (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). Obviously, the specification of a matching algorithm hinges on the two basics factors, i.e. definition of proximity (in the space of the propensity score) and determination of weights (weighting function) (Essama-Nssah, 2006). In some empirical studies 1-to-1 or 1-to-n nearest neighbour with calliper matching methods are used as a standard application. In others, the kernel matching is favoured. Empirical comparison of matching methods suggests that their performance can vary case-by-case thus no one method fits all circumstances and is therefore always preferable (Zhao, 2004; Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). Though asymptotically all PSM estimators should yield the same results (Smith, 2000), in small samples the choice of matching algorithm can be important (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd, 1997). 4.3.3. Matching selection criteria Among many methods allowing to assess the matching quality the most popular approaches are: i) standardized bias (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); ii) t–test (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); iii) joint significance and pseudo R² (Sianesi, 2004); or iv) stratification tests (Dehejia and Wahba 1999, 2002). If the quality indicators are not satisfactory, some reasons might be misspecification of the propensity score model (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005) or failure of the CIA (Smith and Todd, 2005). 4.4. Difference-in-differences estimator (DID) DID is a traditional evaluation estimator for cases where the outcome data on programme participants and non-participants is available for both “before” and “after” periods (t’ and t, respectively), under assumption that the effect of “unobservables” is time invariant. The DID measures the impact of the RD programme by using the differences between programme participants (D=1) and non-participants (D=0) in the before-after situations (i.e. it compares the before-after change of regions which participated in a programme with before-after change of those control regions which did not participate). The simplified notation for the DID calculation can be described as follows: DID = { Σ (Yit | (D=1) – Yit | (D=0)) – Σ (Yit’ | (D=1) – Yit’ | (D=0))}/n (9) Where: (Yit | (D=1) – Yit | (D=0)) is the difference in mean outcomes between the n participants and the m matched comparison units after the access to the RD programme and

A p p l i e d m e t h o d o l o g i e s f o r e v a l u a t i o n o f p r o g r a m m e i m p a c t s a t a r e g i o n a l / m a c r o l e v e l (Yit’ | (D=1) – Yit’ | (D=0)) is the difference in mean outcomes between the n participants and m matched comparison units at date 0 (prior to the RD programme). Yet, the DID method fails if the impact of unobservables is not time-invariant so that a group of programme participants (i.e. regions which participated in a given RD programme) and a control group (regions which did not participate) are on different development trajectories . The probability of having different development trajectories increases if already from the beginning of the programme the observed heterogeneity of both groups (and therefore selection bias) is large. While propensity score matching can be applied as a control for the selection bias on observables at the beginning of the programme, a combination of PSM with DID methods (conditional DID estimator – see 3.5. below) allows for a better controlling of the selection bias in both observables and unobservables. 4.5. Combined PSM and Difference-in- differences estimator (conditional DID estimator) The conditional DID estimator (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd, 1997; Heckman, Ichimura, Smith and Todd, 1998; Smith and Todd, 2005) is highly applicable in case the outcome data on programme participants (i.e. regions which participated in a given RD programme) and non- participants (appropriately constructed control group) is available both “ before ” and “ after ” periods ( t’ and t , respectively). In our study, the PSM-DID measures the impact of the RD programme by using the differences in selected outcome indicators (ATE, or ATT) between programme participants regions (D=1) and comparable non-participants regions (D=0 ) in the before-after situations. The conditional PSM-DID estimator can be defined as follows: PSM-DID = { Σ (Y it | (D=1) – Y it | (D=0)) – Σ (Y it’ | (D=1) – Y it’ | (D=0))}/n (10) Where: (Yit | (D=1) – Yit | (D=0)) is the difference in mean outcomes between regions participating in the RD programme and the PSM matched control units after implementation of a given RD programme and (Yit’ | (D=1) – Yit’ | (D=0)) is the difference in mean outcomes between regions participating in the RD programme and PSM matched control units at date 0 (prior to the beginning of a given RD programme). Given ATE, ATT or ATU computed in periods: t and t’ the PSM-DID estimator can be expressed as: PSM-DID = ATt – AT t’ (11) Where: AT = ATE or ATT or ATU A decisive advantage of the conditional PSM- DID estimator, compared with a standard DID estimator, is that by applying this methodology, initial conditions regarding observable heterogeneity of both groups of regions (programme participants and non-participants) that could influence subsequent changes over time are controlled for. 4.6. Sensitivity analysis 4.6.1. Rosenbaum bounding approach The unconfoundeness assumption about the treatment assignment merely asserts that all variables that simultaneously affect the participation decision and outcome are observed by the researcher. Yet, if there are unobserved variables that simultaneously affect the participation decision and outcome, a hidden bias might arise to which matching estimators are not robust (Rosenbaum, 2002; Becker and 
23 C o u n t e r f a c t u a l i m p a c t e v a l u a t i o n o f E U r u r a l d e v e l o p m e n t p r o g r a m m e s - P r o p e n s i t y S c o r e M a t c h i n g m e t h o d o l o g y . . . Caliendo, 2007). The approach proposed by (Rosenbaum, 2002) allows to determine how much hidden bias would need to be present to render plausible the null hypothesis of no effect, or in another words, how strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process in order to undermine the implications of a standard propensity score matching analysis (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). The Rosenbaum bounding approach does not test the unconfoundedness assumption itself, because this would amount to testing that there are no unobserved variables that influence the selection into the programme; instead it provides evidence on the degree to which any significance results hinge on this untestable assumption (Becker and Caliendo, 2007). An extensive discussion of this sensitivity approach can be found in (Aakvik, 2001; Rosenbaum, 2002; Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005; Becker and Caliendo, 2007). Following these studies we define probability of participation as: P i = P(x i , u i ) = P (D i =1|x i , u i ) = F ( β x i + λ u i ) (12) Where: Di = equals 1 if an unit i participates in programme xi = are the observed characteristics for unit i ui = the unobserved variable λ = is the effect of ui on the participation decision the study is free of hidden bias if λ is zero and participation probability is determined entirely by effects of xi. However, in the presence of hidden bias two matched units (with the same observed covariates x) will have different chances of programme participation. While the odds that both units i and j will participate are given by P i /(1-P i ) and P j /(1-P j ) the odds ratio is equal to [exp ( β x i + λ u i )]/ [exp ( β x j + λ u j )] which in case of identical observed covariates (implied by matching) reduces (the vector x cancels out) to exp { λ (u i -u j )}. Rosenbaum, 2002 showed that this implies the following bounds on the odds ratio so that either of the two matched units will participate: (13) If the odds ratio differs, i.e. departs from a value of 1 this can only be due to hidden bias. In this sense e λ is a measure of the degree of departure from a study that is free of hidden bias (Rosenbaum, 2002; Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005; Becker and Caliendo, 2007). Sensitivity analysis means therefore examining the bounds on the odds ratio for programme participation that lie between 1/ e λ and e λ . 16 Sensitivity analysis, as described above, is applied in our study using formal (Mantel and Haenszel, 1959) test statistics suggested by (Aakvik, 2001) and described in (Becker and Caliendo, 2007). Applications of sensitivity analysis for evaluating social programmes can also be found in (Aakvik, 2001; DiPrete and Gangl, 2004; Caliendo, Hujer and Thomsen, 2005; Watson, 2005). 4.7. Generalized Propensity Score Method Clearly, propensity score matching described above is especially applicable in situations where an RD programme is implemented selectively (i.e. only in some regions, leaving others unaffected). While this situation (i.e. binary treatment) may be in practice limited to only some specific RD measures (e.g. investment in agricultural holdings, environmental measures, less favoured areas, etc.) the standard praxis is that a given 16 With increasing e λ the bounds move apart reflecting uncertainty in test statistics in the presence of unobserved hidden bias.

In case the treatment (i.e. exposure to programme participation) is a continuous variable, the previous setting using a binary propensity score matching has to be extended. Propensity score techniques allowing for multi-valued and continuous treatment effects were proposed by (Imbens, 2002; Lechner, 2002; Imai and van Dyk, 2002; Hirano and Imbens, 2004). Hirano and Imbens (2004) extended the unconfoundedness assumption for binary treatment (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) to multi-valued and continuous treatments and defined the generalized propensity score function (GPS) as the conditional density of the actual treatment given the observed covariates. Empirical applications of a GPS to the evaluation of public policies can be found in (Bia and Mattei, 2007; Kluve et. al, 2007). Hirano and Imbens, 2004 showed that in combination with the unconfoundedness assumption GPS has a balancing property similar to that of the standard propensity score and thus GPS can be used to eliminate any bias associated with differences in the covariates. In order to estimate a programme effect at various levels of treatment we will apply the GPS method by following an approach described in Hirano and Imbens, 2004. The approach consists of three main steps: 1. Estimation of the GPS as a conditional density of treatment given the covariates by: a. estimation of the parameters of the treatment function (conditional distribution of treatment) using maximum likelihood according to: (14) b. assessment of the validity of the assumed normal distribution model by appropriate tests (e.g. Kolomogorov- Smirnov, Shapiro-Francia, Shapiro- Wilk or skewness and kurtosis tests for normality) c. estimation of the GPS as: (15) where and are the estimated parameters in step a). d. testing the balancing property 2. Modelling the conditional expectation of the programme outcome as a flexible function (polynomial approximation) of Ti and Ri 3. Estimation the average potential outcome for each level of treatment and an entire dose- response function as: (16) where is the vector of the estimated parameters in the second stage.

Impact Indicators 5.1. Rural Development Index The main summative impact indicator used in this study of evaluation of RD programmes is the RDI. The methodology applied to construction of a synthetic index of the rural development (RDI) is described in Michalek and Zarnekow, 2011; and Michalek and Zarnekow, 2012. The RDI, as a composite indicator, was calculated according to eq. (17) on the base of regional characteristics Z i and individual weights β k that were derived from the estimated migration function (see: eq. 18). In such a model, the estimated weights β k represent the relative “importance” or a “social value” assigned by a society (composed of those who migrated and those who stayed) to each of characteristics Z k i representing various aspects of the quality of life in all origin and destination regions i . Formally the RDI in each individual region i can be expressed as a linear function of specific i- region characteristics Z k i and their weights β k (see eq 17): RDI i = h ( β k , Z ki ) = Σ k β k * Z ki (17) Where: RDI i = Rural development index (an equivalent of the quality of life index) in region i Z ki = Measurable characteristics k in a region i β k = Weights for each characteristic k derived from the estimated migration function that can be both i -region and time t specific In our study Z ki is constructed empirically using factorization method applied to all relevant coefficients and variables V i available at the regional level. The latter are nested in Z ki (i.e. RD domains) and describe in detail various specific aspects of rural development in each individual region i (e.g. a number of enterprises, employment coefficients, water/air pollution coefficients, schools, health facilities, etc. available from regional secondary statistics). Weights β k that enter the RDI are derived from a migration model (eq 18) where the probability distribution of migration log (m) is a dependent variable, and differences in regional characteristics ∆ F IDKt' , and transaction costs (D) are explanatory variables. While weights β k used to construct the RDI are only a subset of estimated coefficients within a migration model, this feature brings about a separation of the RDI from migration (due to transaction costs). The migration model applied for derivation of weights in the RDI was estimated as a panel regression in form of (18): (18) Where: log (m) = log mrate 1-mrate ( ) mrate = inflows from region i to j divided by ( population in i multiplied by population in j) D ID = distance between region i and j D 2 ID = squared distance between i and j ∆ F IDKt = differences in factors k between regions i j v ID = random intercept at the pair wise ID level

I m p a c t I n d i c a t o r s є IDt = residual with `` usual´´ properties (mean zero, uncorrelated with itself, uncorrelated with D and F, uncorrelated with v and homoscedastic). є = N(0, σ 1 є ) As a random effect model it assumes the random effects occur at the level of the pairwise migration flows between all regions ij (region as a group variable). Model 18 is thus estimated as a random effect linear regression model with a group variable at the level of i j (ID) by using the GLS random effects estimator (a matrix-weighted average of the between and within estimators) 17 . The most important pros and cons of selecting Model 18 as a base for derivation of weights used in calculation of the RDI in comparison with other alternative model specifications are provided in Michalek and Zarnekow, 2009. The major advantages from applying the RDI as an impact indicator to the evaluation of RD programmes are as follows: • The approach allows to consider all potential effects of a given RD programme (aggregated or separated by programme measures) on various rural development domains (economic, social, environmental, etc.) and on the overall quality of life of population living in individual rural areas. 17 The random effect estimator produces more efficient results than between estimator, albeit with unknown small sample properties. The between estimator is less efficient because it discards the over time information in data in favour of simple means; the random-effects estimator uses both the within and the between information (STATA, ver.10; Kennedy, 2003). • The approach allows to incorporate numerous general equilibrium effects of a programme, e.g. multiplier effects, substitution effects, into the analysis . • As an impact indicator the RDI is powerful both at the aggregated level (e.g. NUTS 2) and commune levels (NUTS 5) and even the village level (if data exists). • As an impact indicator the RDI is applicable both for analysis of RD programmes as well as analysis of structural programmes. • The RDI can also be used as an impact indicator for the evaluation of large projects implemented at low regional levels (e.g. NUTS 5). 5.2. Other partial impact indicators Beyond the RDI, other selected partial performance indicators available at regional level (e.g. employment coefficient, rate of rural unemployment, value added, etc.) were used as relevant impact indicators.

Synthesis of the methodological approach to the evaluation of the impact of RD programmes The evaluation techniques described above were applied to the assessment of the impact of an RD programme (SAPARD) in Slovakia and Poland. The following steps were carried out: Firstly, the RDI (as described above) was computed for all i-regions (i.e. where the RD programme was implemented and non- implemented) in a given country. Secondly, binary propensity score matching was applied to estimate the impact of individual SAPARD measures (in both countries individual SAPARD measures were implemented in some regions only (programme participants) and not throughout the whole country) using the RDI, and the unemployment rate as impact indicators. Propensity scores for individual regions in a given country were obtained from a standard logit-model with region- and time-specific characteristics (factors/principal components) computed prior to the beginning of the SAPARD programme (2002) as explanatory variables. Thirdly, some of regions were excluded from further comparisons because their propensity scores were outside the common support. Matched pairs of similar regions etc. were constructed on the basis of how close the estimated scores were across the two samples (supported vs. controls). Several weighting techniques (matching algorithms) were applied to calculate the average outcome indicator of the matched non-supported group, ranging from “nearest neighbour” weights to non-parametric weights (e.g. kernel functions of the differences in scores). The “best” matching algorithm was selected using a minimum standardized bias as a main criterion (conditional on meeting other criteria, e.g. t-tests, ands pseudo R² test). Fourthly, the mean value of the outcome indicator (i.e. RDI and other relevant partial outcome indicators, e.g. unemployment) for the nearest “neighbours” of the programme supported regions was computed using a selected matching algorithm (e.g. Kernel method). Fifthly, the conditional DID method (combination of PSM and DID) was applied to measure the impact of the RD programme on individual regions (2002-2005) 18 . Sixthly, a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to find out: i) whether unobserved factors at the regional level could alter inference on effects of participation in SAPARD, and ii) how strongly an unmeasured variable would have to influence the selection process to undermine the implications of the matching analysis. An assessment of a possible influence of unobservable characteristics on procured results was obtained by applying the methodology described in (Rosenbaum, 2002). The approach “Rosenbaum bounds” allows for testing the presence of unobserved heterogeneity (hidden bias) between supported and non-supported regions. The testing procedure is carried out on the basis of Mantel-Haenszel test statistics that give bound estimates of significance levels at given levels of hidden bias under the assumption of either systematic over- or underestimation of treatment effects. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using a syntax described in: Becker and Caliendo, 2007. 18 Specifically, the difference “one” is the difference in mean outcomes between those regions where programme was implemented and the matched comparison regions after implementation of the RD programme, the difference “two” is the difference in mean outcomes between those regions where programme was implemented and matched comparison regions prior to the RD programme, and the difference “three” is the difference between difference “one” and difference “two”.

Eighthly, the net-impact of the whole RD programme (all measures-together) was estimated at various intensity levels of programme exposure (level of programme expenditures) using the RDI as a synthetic impact indicator and the local unemployment rate as an important partial indicator at regional level. A generalized propensity score methodology that allows for continuous treatment regimes was applied to derive the dose-response function and the derivative of the dose-response function. The above methodology was empirically applied for an estimation of the impact of SAPARD in Poland and Slovakia at the NUTS-4 level in the years 2002-2005.

Data: Poland: Data used for calculation of the RDI at (NUTS-4) in Poland originates from the Regional Data Bank (RDB) of the Polish Statistical Office of the Ministry of Finance (e.g. distribution of personal income) and the Ministry of Interior (e.g. crimes). Above data was collected either at the NUTS-5 level and then aggregated to NUTS-4 or directly at NUTS-4 levels for the years 2002 to 2005. Of 379 NUTS-4 regions in Poland 314 rural Powiats (NUTS-4) are included in the analysis (84.2% of all NUTS4-regions), which excludes 65 big cities. Data basis for Poland covers all relevant rural development dimensions available in regional statistics at the NUTS-4 level and consists of 991 coefficients/indicators collected/calculated either directly at the NUTS-4 level or aggregated from NUTS-5 (approximately 2500 Polish gminas) levels into the NUTS-4 level. Furthermore, above data was supplemented with information on allocation of SAPARD funds (by measures) among NUTS-4 regions. The data base covers the period of 2002-2005. Slovakia : The database for Slovakia originates from Slovak Statistical Office whereby 337 indicators/variables collected at 72 regions (NUTS-4) are used for construction of the RDI. Furthermore, similar as in Poland, above data was supplemented with information provided by RIAFE on allocation of SAPARD funds (by measures) among NUTS-4 regions. The data base covers the period of 2002-2005.

A detailed description of an approach used for the derivation of the RDI in both countries and results obtained can be found in Michalek and Zarnekow, 2011; Michalek and Zarnekow, 2012. Poland 8.1. Construction of the RDI as a programme impact indicator The RDI in Poland involving 991 regional indicators was calculated for all (314) rural NUTS-4 regions and the years 2002-2005 according to eq. 17. On the basis of the estimated RDIs rural regions were ranked in terms of their overall level of rural development. The ranking of NUTS-4 regions over the years 2002-2005 is shown in Figure 1. The geographical distribution of the RDI in Poland (the average of 2002 and 2005) is shown in Figure 2. The results of the RDI estimation confirm a clear typological division of Poland based on the performance of individual rural regions into a good performing western- and central part, and a badly performing eastern part (north- eastern and south-eastern),. The results also back up a general opinion that suburbs of the biggest cities (e.g. Warsaw, Poznan, Gdansk, Wroclaw, Lodz, Krakow) exhibit the highest quality of life (see Figure 2). The lowest RDIs (i.e. less than -0.08) were found in remote regions situated in south-eastern Poland, i.e. hrubieszowski (on the border with Ukraine), bierunsko-ledzinski (a former heavy industrial complex in south Poland), chelmski (on the border with Ukraine), bieszczadzki (a remote region bordering to Ukraine and Slovakia) for details see Table 1 in Annex). As mentioned before, an estimation of the RDI (by region) in Poland was carried out on the basis of factors obtained by applying a principal Figure 1: Poland: Ranking of regions.

32 8 . R e s u l t s The overview of the main factors/components is shown in Table 1. Due to its comprehensiveness, the RDI can be used as the impact indicator measuring the effects of various rural and structural programmes affecting rural areas. In our study, the RDI will be applied to evaluation of the overall impact of the pre-accession SAPARD programme (2002-2004). 8.2. Scope and regional distribution of the selected SAPARD measure The assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Poland was carried out by taking as an example a measure that was especially designed to improve the quality of life of the population living in rural areas (i.e. SAPARD measure 3 “Development and improvement of rural infrastructure”). Of 6230 investment proposals submitted under this measure to the Polish Agency for Modernisation and Restructuring (SAPARD implementing agency) 4492 contracts (years 2002-2004) were signed and implemented in the following years amounting to approximately 2 bn PLN (approximately €547m), of which 1.520m PLN (€411m) were co-financed from the EU. The main beneficiaries of this measure were local administration units (gminas at NUTS-5 and poviats at NUTS-4 levels). The major financial allocations under Measure 3 concerned the development and modernisation of roads (41%), waste water disposal (41%), water supply to agricultural holdings (16%), solid waste management (0.41%), and the provision of renewable energy (0.35%). An impact assessment of a given RD programme (measure 3) requires some basic information about: 1. Which regions were supported by the given RD programme (measure 3)?; and 2. What was the local/regional intensity of this support? Although basic data on financial aspects linked to the implementation of Measure 3 under the SAPARD programme was generally available (e.g. total programme spending by measure and region) answering the above questions could create some problems because: a. In several regions (average NUTS-4 region, 81 000 population and 973 km²), funds from the SAPARD programme that were allocated during the years 2002-2004 to eligible infrastructural investments under measure 3 were almost negligible (e.g. total public support from this programme measure was less than €0.1m per region). In this situation, it would not be justifiable to classify these regions as supported from the programme; b. The intensity of the programme support can be measured using various indicators, e.g. total per region; per capita in region; or per km² in region. While all of these indicators have both advantages and disadvantages, an objective appraisal of programme impact may require using of all three criteria. An analysis of the geographical allocation of funds under SAPARD Measure 3 shows that programme resources were not equally distributed across all NUTS-4 regions. The majority of available resources under SAPARD (Measure 3) were used to improve the rural infrastructure in eastern and south-eastern Poland (see graphs 2a-2c). These were also the areas where individual exposure/intensity (per region, per capita or km²) to the programme (measure 3) was the highest. Further analysis of allocation of funds under measure 3 shows a negative correlation of the programme intensity with the RDI (see Table 2) thus confirming that available resources from SAPARD (Measure 3) were primarily targeting less- and medium- developed rural regions.

Division of regions between supported and non-supported Considering that only five (out of 314) NUTS-4 regions did not receive any support from the SAPARD programme under Measure 3, and in a further 16 regions the support from the programme (Measure 3) was almost negligible (i.e. did not exceed €200,000 per region), an arbitrary threshold had to be imposed to differentiate between programme supported and non-supported regions. As a general rule, those regions where the programme intensity (Measure 3) was lower than 2/3 of the median were qualified as “not supported”. The same rule (removed in Chapter 8.9) was applied to all programme intensity measures (i.e. M3 per region; M3 per capita; and M3 per km²) 19 . 19 While, the effectiveness of relatively small yet well designed investments (e.g. addressing point source environmental pollution) can be very high thus setting of a threshold above which amount a region can be considered as supported is always arbitrary.

Intensity of programme exposure per region basis (M3 per region) The application of an indicator “M3 per region” (and the setting of the above threshold) as the main criterion determining the status of an individual region (supported vs. non- supported) resulted in a division of 314 NUTS- 4 regions into two groups: i) programme participants (185 regions), if programme funds (measure 3) allocated to a respective region were above 4.1m PLN (€1.1m) per region; and ii) programme “non-participants” (129 regions), if allocated funds per region were below this threshold 20 . Initial differences in regional characteristics of participants vs. non-participants prior to the implementation of SAPARD (2002) are shown in Table 3.

Indeed, in extreme situation some small regions (programme participants) could be assigned a status of “non-participants” only due to the fact that allocated programme funds did not exceed the arbitrary threshold (as at region basis). In fact, by setting a threshold the interpretation of the programme impact may change by restricting it to effects of substantial programme allocations (above 1.1 Mill EUR).

R e s u l t s Where: F = endowments in factors/ RD components D = 1 (Group 1; i.e. programme participants) D = 0 (Group 2; i.e. programme non-participants RDI2002 = RDI in 2002 Unemplrur02 = rural unemployment rate (% of rural unemployment in total unemployment) We note that both groups of regions (Group1 = supported vs. Group2 = non-supported) differed considerably both in terms of their overall level of rural development (measured by the RDI) as well as in terms of other regional characteristics (factors 1-17, total unemployment, rural unemployment, etc.). For example, the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI prior to the SAPARD programme in year 2002) in the group of regions qualified here as programme participants (i.e. Group 1: less developed regions) was about half of the group of programme non-participants (i.e. Group 2: better developed regions). When compared with the level of rural unemployment (the percentage of rural unemployed in the total unemployed), the respective figures prior to the SAPARD programme were 62% in Group 1 compared with 52% in group 2. The analysis of individual factors characterizing other aspects of rural development prior to beginning of the SAPARD programme, e.g. f4 (percentage of the highest income groups and housing availability), f5 (subsidies and social expenditures), f8 (rural infrastructure, e.g. gas supply system) or f11 (Heating energy sector <pollution> and deaths) indicate significant differences between both groups of regions (see Table 3). It also indicates a much worse economic, social and environmental performance of Group 1 (later supported by SAPARD) compared with Group 2 (non-supported). Given the above, we therefore conclude that the allocation of SAPARD funds (Measure 3) was carefully targeted and determined by the actual economic, social and environmental situation of individual rural regions. Clearly, significant differences in individual characteristics (factor endowments) in both groups of regions prior to the SAPARD programme (2002) confirm the existence of a considerable selection bias and therefore a non-direct comparability of both groups of regions . In other words, a direct use of selected impact indicators (e.g. an RDI, added value, employment etc.) for assessment of the impact of SAPARD by performing a counterfactual analysis confined to a simple comparison of performance of these indicators in the above groups (e.g. using a traditional DID method) would not be appropriate. This could lead to biased results unless there is strong additional evidence that the hidden bias (unobserved by evaluators) remains time invariant. As this cannot normally be guaranteed, one should apply evaluation techniques that ensure the full comparability of programme participants and control groups of regions, e.g. by drawing on matching principles (e.g. propensity score matching). 8.4. Estimation of propensity score Given information about individual regional characteristics prior to the SAPARD programme (year 2002) and the status of each individual region (programme participants vs. programme non-participants), a logit function was estimated using factors (f1-f17) and unemployment coefficients as covariates. The results of the logit estimation are shown in Table 4 The results of this estimation were then used to derive the individual probability of programme participation (propensity scores) for all regions. Clearly, in order to ensure comparability, the estimated propensity scores of regions that participated in the SAPARD programme (measure 3) and their controls should be very similar. As the probability of observing two units with exactly the same value of the propensity score is in principle zero (since p(Z) is a continuous variable), the estimation of desirable programme effects (e.g. ATT, ATE, etc.) requires using appropriate matching algorithms. These set up the measure of proximity in order to define

Selection of a matching algorithm The most commonly used matching algorithms involving propensity score are: Nearest Neighbour Matching, Radius Matching, Stratification Matching and Kernel Matching (Cohran and Rubin, 1973; Dehejia and Wahba, 1999; Heckman, Ichimura and Todd. 1997, 1998; Heckman; Ichimura, Smith and Todd, 1998). While asymptotically all PSM matching techniques should yield the same results, the choice of matching method (or applied matching parameters e.g. number of nearest neighbours, radius magnitude, kernel type, etc.) can make a difference in small samples (Smith, 2000) 21 . As the quality of a given matching technique depends strongly on a dataset, the selection of a relevant matching technique in our study was carried out using three independent criteria: i) standardized bias (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); ii) t–test (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); and iii) joint significance and pseudo R² (Sianesi, 2004). We found that the best results were achieved by using an iterative procedure (e.g. linear 21 Description of trade-offs linked to each of matching algorithms can be found in (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005).

In all considered cases (various matching algorithms) 23 an optimal solution could easily be found due to local/global convexity of the objective function with respect to function parameters under each matching algorithm (e.g. radius magnitude in radius matching; or number of nearest neighbours in nearest neighbour matching). An overview of results obtained using different matching algorithms is provided in Table 5. In our example (314 total observations; participation criterion: M3 per region; impact indicator: RDI in 2002) the radius calliper matching (0.21) was selected as the best matching algorithm (see Table. 5). The imposition 22 The standardized bias is the difference of the sample means in the treated and non-treated (full or matched) sub-samples as a percentage of the square root of the average of the sample variances in the treated and non- treated groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985). 23 This does not apply to local linear weighting function matching which first smoothes the outcome and then performs nearest neighbor matching. In this case more controls are used to calculate the counterfactual outcome than the nearest neighbor only (Leuven and Sianesi, 2007). of a common support region resulted in dropping 19 programme supported and 9 programme non-supported regions (outside of common support) from a further analysis, thus selecting a comparable 166 programme participants regions (out of a total of 185) and 120 programme non-participants regions (out of a total of 129) as relevant counterparts. In the next step the balancing property tests (t-test) were carried out to verify statistically the comparability of selected groups of regions in terms of observable covariates (Table 6). The above tests show that the applied matching procedure (i.e. minimization of the standardized selection bias using calliper matching 0.21) considerably improved comparability of both groups of regions, making a counterfactual analysis more realistic. Indeed, previously existing significant differences (measured in terms of t-test) in variables between the group of regions supported from the SAPARD programme (D=1) and non-supported regions (D=0) before matching dropped after matching (differences became no more significant). This applies to all important variables determining both programme participation and outcomes, e.g. RDI 2002; unemployment rate, rural unemployment, Table 5: Poland: Comparison of matching algorithms (participation criterion: M3 per region; impact indicator: RDI in 2002) Matching method Matching parameters Estimated standardized bias (after matching) Nearest neighbours N (6) 9.59 N (7) 8.88 → min N (8) 9.73 Radius caliper (0.2) 7.57 (0.21) 7.41 → Selection Min {Min} (0.22) 7.47 Kernel normal (Gaussian) bandwidth (0.08) 7.64 bandwidth (0.09) 7.48 → min bandwidth (0.10) 7.57 Kernel biweight 7.92 Kernel epanechnikov bandwidth (0.25) 7.59 bandwidth (0.24) 7.58 → min bandwidth (0.23) 7.61

R e s u l t s as well as factors f4 (the percentage of highest income groups and housing availability), f5 (subsidies and social expenditures), f8 (gas supply system) or f11 (Heating energy sector <pollution> and deaths), and others. Also other tests, e.g. pseudo R² (pseudo R² = 0.24 before matching and pseudo R²= 0. 07 after matching) confirmed the high quality of the selected matching procedure and thus applicability of the used approach. 8.5. Calculation of policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, ATU) Comprehensive assessment of programme impact at a regional level requires separation of various important programme effects, e.g. effect on regions which participated in a given programme (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated - ATT); effect on an average region randomly selected from the pool of programme participants and non-participants (Average Treatment Effect – ATE) or an effect of the programme on the regions that did not participate (Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated – ATU). In our study, the above policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, ATU) were calculated on the basis of estimated propensity scores using the following programme impact indicators: a. RDI b. Unemployment rate (general) c. Rural unemployment (percentage of rural unemployment in total unemployment) The results of ATT, ATE and ATU calculations are shown in Table 7. Given these parameters the programme impact is quantified using a conditional DID estimator , i.e. combining PSM (ATT, ATE, ATU) and difference in differences (DID) methods. 8.6. Combined PSM and DID estimator The application of the binary PSM method (including thresholds), and the conditional DID estimator to the assessment of the programme impact shows that the effect of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development in regions that participated in the programme (less developed regions) was almost negligible. Indeed, probably due to a low programme intensity and a short time horizon, the estimated impact of infrastructural measures (Measure 3) on the overall RDI in regions that participated in the programme (i.e. a difference between ATT in 2002 and ATT in 2005) was close to zero (the difference between the RDI in regions participating in the programme and regions non- supported remained almost constant over the years 2002-2005). In contrast, a slight positive impact of SAPARD (Measure 3) was found on rural unemployment. When measured in absolute values, between 2002 and 2005 rural unemployment stayed on average (all 314 regions) at a similar level (approximately 58% of total unemployment). Yet, during the same period in our comparable groups (matched regions supported by the programme and similar control group) rural unemployment increased, due to negative economic conditions characterising these regions. Interestingly, in the same time period rural unemployment in the control group of regions (non-participants) grew stronger (0.0095) compared with the group of programme participants (0.0061). Consequently, the estimated ATT dropped from 0.0148 in 2002 (difference between 0.599 for D=1 and 0.584 for D=0) to 0.0114 in 2005 (difference between 0.605 for D=1 and 0.594 for D=0) thus indicating a slight but positive 24 impact of SAPARD (Measure 3) on rural unemployment in those regions supported by the programme. 24 Due to a negative context of the impact indicator (unemployment) a positive change in ATT (difference between after and before) would indicate a negative impact of the programme.

Furthermore, we found that the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) would have a slight but positive impact on rural unemployment (i.e. decrease) both in: a. those regions that were previously excluded from the programme (a negative change in estimated ATU between 2002 and 2005), as well as b. any other region randomly selected from a total sample of both groups of regions (a negative difference in ATE between 2002 and 2005). From the policy point of view conclusions based on ATT parameters are especially important (i.e. impact on those regions which were supported from the programme). Concerning the conclusions (a) and (b) their relevance is restricted due to the fact that they include the effect on regions j for which the programme was never intended/ designed (from an administrative point of view these regions may be even programme ineligible). 8.7. Other programme intensity and participation criteria As the measurement of the intensity of a region’s participation in the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on a per region basis (with a threshold) may appear problematic, especially in the case of small regions, two other alternative participation measures were applied: 1. programme exposure per capita; and 2. programme exposure per km² As in the case of programme exposure per region respective participation thresholds were set at the level of 66% of the country’s average. 8.7.1.

42 8 . R e s u l t s combined with the application of the above thresholds (D=0 if regional programme exposure is below a 66% of regions’ average; otherwise D=1) resulted in the following division of 314 NUTS-4 regions: 1. per capita: 188 regions supported and 126 regions non-supported, or 2. per km²: 178 regions supported and 136 region non-supported As in the case of “programme exposure per region”, in both settings (i.e. per capita and per km²) supported and non-supported regions were found to differ considerably in economic, social and environmental aspects of rural development. For example, when measuring the intensity of programme participation on per capita basis, the RDI (2002) in the group of regions supported from the programme (D=1) was as much as 2/3 lower compared with the group of programme non-participants (D=0); rural unemployment in 2002 in group 1 was much higher than in group 2 (64% compared with 48%); endowment with factor 4 (high income groups and housing availability) in group 1 was far below the country average (-0.18), whereas in group 2 it was far above (+0.16). Similar differences were also observable in the case of other partial indicators. Clearly, significant differences between both groups of regions in terms of individual regional characteristics (RDI, factor endowments, etc.) confirm (similarly to the case of “programme intensity per region”) the existence of a considerable selection bias preventing a direct comparability of both regional clusters within a counterfactual analysis. 8.7.1.1. Selection of appropriate matching algorithm As with programme exposure on a per region basis, the selection of the best matching algorithm on a per capita or km² basis was carried out using the method described in Section 8.3.2.3. The application of the above technique resulted in the selection of a radius calliper 0.23 (for per capita setting); and Gaussian kernel (bandwidth 0.14) (for per km² setting) as the matching algorithms that guaranteed the minimization of a standardized bias (after matching).

Combined PSM and ATT estimator (conditional DID estimator) The application of the conditional DID estimator to a measurement of the programme impact at regional level (using programme intensity per capita basis as a criterion for programme participation) during the period 2002-20005 shows, as in the case of the per region indicator, an almost negligible effect of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall quality of life (DID in ATT = -0.0011) and rural unemployment (DID in ATT = 0.0006) in regions supported from the programme (see Table 10). These results differ from results obtained by applying traditional evaluation techniques (e.g. DID using a group of non- participants or the country average as respective controls), which showed a positive effect on RDI (i.e. 0.0069 or 0.0077) and a slightly positive impact on rural unemployment (i.e. -0.0007 and -0.0003).

Sensitivity of obtained results The sensitivity of obtained results was estimated using the procedure proposed in Rosenbaum (2002). The approach allows the determination of how much hidden bias would need to be present to render the null hypothesis of no effect, or in another words, how strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process in order to undermine the implications of a standard (binary) propensity score matching analysis (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). The procedure applied in this study calculates Rosenbaum bounds for average treatment effects on the programme supported regions in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity (hidden bias) between treatment and control cases 25 . 25 The procedure calculates Wilcoxon signrank tests that give upper and lower bound estimates of significance levels at given levels of hidden bias. Under the assumption of additive treatment effects, rbounds also provides Hodges- Lehmann point estimates and confidence intervals for the average treatment effect on the treated (Gangl, M., in STATA 10.1; 2007). In the case of a per region basis, sensitivity analysis shows that the estimated positive effect of SAPARD (Measure 3) on rural unemployment is rather sensitive to unobservable heterogeneity (i.e. sensitive to possible deviations from the identifying unconfoundedness assumption). Indeed, an increase of gamma by 10% to Γ = 1.1 would result in insignificance of obtained results at the 10% significance level (sig + = 0.14 in 2002 and sig + = 0.16 in 2005). Of course, this result does not mean that unobserved heterogeneity exists and there is no effect of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment. This result only states that the confidence interval for the effect would include zero if an unobservable variable caused the odds ratio between regions supported from the programme and the control group to be higher than 1.1. In the case of per capita and per km², estimated results are less sensitive, i.e. only a hidden bias increasing gamma to 1.2 (1.4) would lead to an insignificance of obtained results.

46 8 . R e s u l t s 8.9. Application of a generalized propensity score matching to the assessment of SAPARD’s impact at regional level An important problem linked to the evaluation of programme impact using the binary PSM method, in a situation where almost all regions received a support from the given programme, is the small size or a non-availability of a control group (D=0). Depending on data, this problem can be partly solved within a framework of binary treatment (i.e. using the binary PSM method) by applying a threshold and considering regions experiencing low programme intensity (below the threshold) as programme non-supported regions (see Chapter 8.3 above) . However, beyond some uncertainties as to the appropriateness of a given threshold level, the application of the “threshold approach” in combination with a traditional (i.e. binary) PSM method to the assessment of programme impact, may also not be particularly efficient as this framework largely disregards information normally available about the programme intensity (measured per region, per capita or km² basis). Indeed, in order to learn more about the effectiveness of a given programme’s dependence on the level of programme exposure (effectiveness dynamics) a more sophisticated approach has to be applied. If the level of programme support (i.e. exposure to programme participation) is a continuous variable (e.g. programme financial allocation by regions, per capita or per km² ) a generalized propensity score matching (GPSM) methodology is especially advantageous. Especially interesting here is the possibility of the estimation of the average and marginal potential outcomes that correspond to specific values of continuous programme doses (i.e. for each level of programme support ) by means of a dose-response and derivative dose-response functions. Application of the GPSM methodology to an analysis of the impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) in Poland was carried out using information on a per region basis as a respective measure of programme intensity. The analytical steps are described in Chapter 4.7. 8.9.1. Estimation of GPS and dose response function Given that for each region i we observe a vector of specific regional covariates (X= f1- f17), the level of support (T) from the SAPARD programme (Measure 3), and the potential outcome corresponding to a given programme intensity level (Y(T)= RDI, rural unemployment, etc.) our basic objective is to estimate the average and the derivative of the dose-response function (ADRF) = μ(t) and DDRF = v (t), where: μ(t) = E [Y(T)] = the average effect of the programme in dependence on programme intensity; v(t) = E[Y(T+1)- Y(T)] = derivative dose response function, in dependence on programme intensity. As shown in Hirano and Imbens (2004) the conditional density of the treatment given covariates, the Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) has a balancing property similar to the balancing property of the propensity score for binary treatments. Adjusting for the GPS therefore removes all bias associated with differences in region specific covariates. In our study, region specific GPS was estimated as a conditional density of treatment (T) given covariates describing individual characteristics of the region (factors f1-f17). The parameters of the treatment function (conditional distribution of treatment) were estimated using maximum likelihood. The major steps and results of generalized propensity score estimation (programme intensity per region ) are described below. 8.9.1.1.

Calculation of the GPS and testing the balancing property Given region specific information on Ti, Xi as well as estimated under 8.9.1.1. parameters ( ^ y and σ ^2 the value of the GPS was calculated (evaluated) for each region according to eq 15. Having estimated the GPS, similar to the case of binary treatment, it is crucial to investigate whether the GPS specification is adequate, i.e. whether it balances the covariates (Hirano and Imbens, 2004; Bia and Mattei, 2007; Kluve, et al. 2007). In order to implement the balancing property tests we divided the range of programme intensity into four treatment intervals (i.e. less than 5m PLN per regions; 5-10m per region; 10-20m per region; 20-43m per region), with 169 observations in the first group, 90 in the second, 45 in the third, and 10 in the last treatment interval. Respective tests were carried out on the conditional mean of the pre-treatment variables given the generalized propensity score is not different between regions that belong to a particular treatment interval and regions that belong to all other treatment intervals. The balancing tests were performed for each single variable included in the list of covariates and each mean treatment interval. According to a standard two-sided t-test we found that in all treatment intervals the balancing property was satisfied at a level lower than 0.01, thus the covariates in both groups of regions were not significantly different (t-test for each of the 17 covariates and each four groups of intervals are shown in Appendix 1). 8.9.2. Modelling the conditional expectation of the programme outcome Given Ti and the estimated GPS (R i ) for each NUTS-4 regions, the conditional expectation of the programme outcome measured in terms of RDI (Y = ∆ RDI) was modelled as a flexible function of its two arguments (T i and R i ) according to eq 17 (polynomial quadratic function). Y = b 0 + b 1 T + b 2 T² + b 3 GPS + b 4 GPS² + b 5 T*GPS (17) The results of this estimation, with the outcome variable representing the change of the overall level of rural development (i.e. RDI2005- RDI2002) and Ti, Ti square, Ri and Ri square as independent variables are shown in Table 13. As shown in Hirano and Imbens (2004) in this model the estimated coefficients do not have Table 13: Poland: Estimated parameters of the conditional expectation of the programme outcome (SAPARD programme – Measure 3) The regression model 1s: Y = T + T^2 + GPS + GPS^2 + T*GPS Source ss df MS Number of obs = 314 F(5, 308) = 1.12 Pr ob > F = 0.3477 R-squared = 0.0179 Adj R-squared = 0.0020 Root MSE = .02232 Model Residual .002798331 .153406037 5 308 .000559666 .000498072 Total .156204369 313 .000499055 ∆ RDI (2002-2005) Coef.

Yet, the parameters of the estimated regression model (17) are later used to estimate the outcome of programme support in particular at level T. 8.9.3. Estimation the average potential outcome for each level of treatment (entire dose- response function) Given the estimated individual conditional expectations of the programme outcome at the individual (regional) programme intensity levels, the entire dose-response function (DRF) was computed as the average potential outcome for each level of treatment according to eq. 16. After averaging the dose-response over propensity score for each level of T, the marginal causal effects were computed in the form of the derivative dose-response function E[Y(T+1) - Y(T)]. In our study bootstrapping methods were used to obtain standard errors that take into consideration the estimation of GPS and parameters of the estimated conditional expectation function. 8.10. Impact of SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development The results of the above calculations, together with the estimates of the derivative dose-response function that provides information about the marginal effects of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) are shown in Table 14. A graphical presentation of obtained results (i.e. impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development) is shown in Figure 4. The application of the GPS matching and the dose response function to the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development in regions supported by the programme (a change of the RDI as an impact indicator), enables a more precise estimation of the effects of the SAPARD programme when compared with traditional evaluation techniques or methodologies based on binary PSM methods.

50 8 . R e s u l t s The main findings from the application of the GPS matching and DRF are as follows: 1. Results from the GPS and dose response function generally show a positive effect of SAPARD (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development in supported regions. However, they also show that this positive impact was observable only for regions supported from the programme at a higher intensity level (i.e. above approximately 17m PLN per region). Negligible programme effects were mainly found in regions with a low programme intensity (this only applies to regions that received less than 40% of the maximum support level, i.e. or lower than 80% of the average programme intensity). 2. An increase of the intensity of programme support ( per region basis) was found to bring about a significant increase of returns (positive change in the overall level of rural development or the RDI). 3. The highest effects of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) were found in those regions which received the highest programme support (i.e. regions which obtained from the programme between 20- 43m PLN from the programme). 4. Not surprisingly, taking into consideration a generally low absolute level of programme support, the marginal effectiveness of SAPARD funds (Measure 3) was found to be highest in regions that received absolute support far above an average support level. This shows that an expected threshold of programme intensity (rural investments) causing diminishing returns was well above the obtained maximum (i.e. above 43m PLN per NUTS-4 region). 5. For some reason (probably due to high unit costs of the programme), the effectiveness of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) in regions that received the smallest absolute support (i.e. less than €100k per region) appeared to be negative . 6. While the estimated dose response function shows a plausible causality between SAPARD funds (Measure 3) and the overall rural development, the estimated Figure 4: Poland: Estimated dose response function, treatment effect function and 95% confidence bands for the impact of SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the RDI (criterion: per region) in years 2002-2005

Impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment Another important outcome (impact) indicator that may be used to assess the effects of the SAPARD programme in regions that received programme support is the change in rural unemployment. In principle, all steps to assess the impact of SAPARD on rural unemployment are similar to those carried out for the assessment of the programme on the overall level of rural development. The only difference is the selection of the outcome indicator (i.e. a change in rural unemployment ratio instead of a change in the RDI). The results of the application of GPS and a dose response function methodology (including derivative dose-response function) to the evaluation of SAPARD impact on rural unemployment are shown in Table 15. Graphical results of SAPARD impact on rural unemployment are presented in Figure 5. The main findings from the application of GPS matching and dose response (and derivative dose response) functions to the measurement of the effects of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment in Poland (years 2002- 2005) are as follows: 1. The SAPARD programme (Measure 3) was found to have a slight but positive effect on rural unemployment in NUTS-4 regions in Poland (years 2002-2005), i.e. rural unemployment was found to decrease slightly due to the SAPARD programme (the results of GPS were lower compared with the effects estimated by using a binary PSM method). 2. Also, as in the case of the RDI, the impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment was found to be highest in those regions that received the maximum programme support (above 20m PLN per region). 3. The impact of SAPARD (Measure 3) on rural unemployment in regions that received the lowest amount of funds from the programme was found to be almost zero (or negative). 4. With regard to marginal effects of the SAPARD programme on rural unemployment, these were positive at all programme intensity levels. Yet, the size of these effects was found to be relatively small and the estimated marginal effects remained almost constant along with the increase of programme intensity. 5. While the estimated dose response function shows a plausible causality between SAPARD funds (Measure 3) and the diminution of rural unemployment, the estimated 95% confidence intervals become wider along with the intensity of treatment (programme impacts become more uncertain).

Assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia 9.1. Rural Development Index as an impact outcome indicator An important impact indicator applied to the assessment of the overall impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia is the Rural Development Index (RDI). The RDI in Slovakia was calculated for all (72) rural NUTS-4 regions and the years 2002- 2005 according to eq 7, on the basis of 337 regional indicators (21 region- and time-specific factors) and weights obtained from the estimated migration function. Territorial distribution of the RDI in Slovakia (by NUTS-4 regions) over the period 2002-2005 is shown in Figure 6 (below). During the years 2002-2005, the estimated value of the RDI in Slovakia ranged from -0.51 to +0.91 (i.e. the regional discrepancies in the overall level of rural development were stronger in Slovakia than in Poland). As expected, the highest values of the RDI (i.e. highest development level of rural areas) were found in high performing regions located in West Slovakia (e.g. Senec, Pezinok, Dunajska Streda, Galanta, etc.). On the other hand the lowest RDI values (i.e. the lowest level of the overall rural development) were found in regions located in Eastern Slovakia and Central Slovakia (e.g. Gelnica, Stropkov, Namestovo, Kezmarok, Stara Lubovna). The results obtained therefore confirm a clear typographic division of Slovakia into western, central and eastern sub-areas based on the performance of individual regions, and reiterate a general opinion that the level of rural development in Slovakia decreases considerably from West to East.

Regional characteristics as the main covariates determining selection of the region to the SAPARD programme As mentioned before, the estimation of the RDI in Slovakia was carried out on the basis of 21 region- and time-specific factors , obtained by applying a principal component method to 337 regional specific coefficients describing various aspects of rural development. Application of the above methodology enabled the description of individual rural regions (a unique identification) in terms of their socio-economic and environmental characteristics (factors f1-f21). The overview of the main individual regional characteristics (factors) and their estimated social weights is shown in Table 16. In the case of EU rural development programmes, the decision to select a particular region to a given structural or rural development programme is normally taken by a respective national Programme Managing Authority; this decision is made on the basis of strengths and weaknesses analysis (SWOT 26 ). While SWOT analysis is a subjective assessment of a current situation in a given region, it draws upon regional data, including various partial socio-economic and environmental indicators. Here we apply a similar procedure in order to simulate a selection process of a given region to the SAPARD programme. I.e. by explaining a regional specificity and individual regional performance in terms of factors (f1-f21) we consider implicitly all important partial coefficients that are usually accounted for in a SWOT analysis. Following this approach, factors (f1-f21), representing individual regional characteristics in the years 2002-2005, are used later (i.e. in estimation of a logit model or within a framework of generalized propensity score matching) as the main covariates explaining differences in regional performance and the probability of selection of an individual region into a specific rural development programme (e.g. SAPARD programme). 26 SWOT is an acronym for Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threads analysis.

Scope and distribution of funds from the SAPARD programme in Slovakia Estimation of the impact of the SAPARD programme at regional basis requires information about regional distribution and intensity of total SAPARD funds (i.e. Measures 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) between the years 2002-2004. The implementation of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia resulted in the support of approximately 904 projects for a total amount of 4745m SKK funds (€111.5m). The majority of SAPARD funds were allocated to the Priority 1 “Improving of agricultural production sector including food industry” (61% of total SAPARD funds), e.g. investment projects in the agricultural and food industry sectors. This was followed by Priority 2 “Sustainable rural development” (38%), e.g. diversification and investment in rural infrastructure; agro-tourism projects or environmental projects. Funds for priority 3 “Development of human activities”, e.g. technical assistance (1%), were allocated last. A statistical analysis of SAPARD distribution by regions indicates a high variability of programme support intensity (see Table 17). While an average region (NUTS-4) in Slovakia received approx. 64.1m SKK from the SAPARD programme, some regions (e.g. Nitra region in West Slovakia) received more than 254m SKK (four times more than the country average). On the other hand, some other regions received only 0.1m SKK (€25k), e.g. the Poltar region in Middle Slovakia.

56 9 . A s s e s s m e n t o f t h e i m p a c t o f t h e S A P A R D p r o g r a m m e i n S l o v a k i a The geographical distribution of SAPARD funds (per region basis) across NUTS-4 regions shows that, contrary to some expectations, the majority of available programme resources were allocated to the best developed regions of West Slovakia (55% of total funds or 95.8m SKK per region) followed by Middle Slovakia (24% of total funds or 45.1m SKK per region) and Eastern Slovakia (21% of total funds or 44.9m SKK per region). A similar picture was obtained when considering SAPARD intensity on a per capita basis, i.e. the highest programme intensity was measured in the best developed regions located in West Slovakia (1135 SKK per capita =100%), followed by Middle Slovakia (69%) and Eastern Slovakia (65%). An analysis of the geographical distribution of SAPARD therefore shows, that programme funds were merely used to reinforce the market position of relatively well performing Slovak enterprises (i.e. mostly large agricultural farms and food industry companies) located in relatively well developed regions 27 . While the most developed regions were primarily able to apply for and accommodate the majority of funds available from the SAPARD programme successfully, our analysis confirms this development by showing a significant (at 0.05 level) positive correlation (0.43) between the intensity of programme support (measured per region basis) and the overall level of rural development measured in terms of the RDI (Table 18) 28 . 27 These companies were also the most effective in submission of well-designed project proposals. 28 Also when calculating at per capita basis, the intensity of SAPARD funds was found to be significantly (at 0.05 level) and positively correlated with the overall level of rural development (yet, correlation was much lower =0.24).

Approaches for assessment of the impact of SAPARD programme An analysis of the allocation of total SAPARD funds’, in Slovakia shows that all NUTS-4 rural regions in the period 2002- 2004 were, to some extent, supported (at least by one of 1-7 measures) from the SAPARD programme. However, the distribution of an individual (regional) intensity to programme exposure was highly skewed. In many cases the intensity of programme support (per region) was almost negligible (e.g. Poltar, Turcianskie Teplice, etc.). In 42% of Slovak regions the total programme support was lower than 66% of an average support measured per capita basis (i.e. lower than 600 SKK per capita, compared with 904 SKK per capita in regions’ average). With regard to the regional distribution of programme support linked to individual programme measures (1-7), the picture is slightly different. That is to say, in all examined cases (applies to each individual measure) the support from the SAPARD programme embraced only a subset of all NUTS-4 regions (i.e. in no single case did the programme support linked to a specific SAPARD measure embrace all Slovak regions). Additionally, many Slovak regions obtained the support from individual SAPARD measures that was below 66% of the country average (for a given measure). Taking into consideration the above situation, the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme was carried out using two complementary approaches: • Approach 1 (based on the binary PSM matching method) allowed the estimation of the effectiveness of the programme support by comparing regions that: a) received support from the programme with equivalent regions that did not receive any support from SAPARD, or b) received programme support above a certain threshold (e.g. above 66% of country’s average) with those where programme intensity was much below the country average. This approach was applied basically to the assessment of the impact of individual programme’s measures. • Approach 2 (based on the application of the generalized propensity score matching and dose-response function), allowed the estimation of the impact of the total support from the SAPARD programme at various programme support levels. This approach was applied mainly to the assessment of the impact of total funds from the SAPARD programme (i.e. where all regions were supported). 9.5. Application of a binary PSM matching to the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia 9.5.1. Total SAPARD funds (all measures) The application of Approach 1, including the setting of the threshold (66% of the country average per capita), resulted in the division of all NUTS-4 regions into two groups: a) 42 regions where support obtained from the SAPARD programme was above the threshold (600 SKK per capita), and b) 30 regions “non-SAPARD Table 18: Slovakia: Correlation matrix between intensity of SAPARD (per region basis) and the RDI RDI 2002 SAPARD funds (total) RDI 2002 1.0000 SAPARD funds (total) 0.4303* 1.0000

Comparison of these two groups of regions (applying 600 SKK per capita as a threshold) reveals significant differences in all major regional characteristics (factors 1-21) determining both the selection of individual regions into the programme as well as the effect of the SAPARD programme (Table 19). The most obvious differences, except of the overall level of rural development (the RDI was much higher in the programme supported group D=1 compared with non-supported regions D=0), concern factors f4 (Agriculture and natural endowment, with a much higher intensity level in group D=1 compared with group D=0), f3 (Social conditions and living environment (incl. availability of dwelling; with a much higher level of endowment in group D=1 compared with D=0), f16 (Primary schools; with a much higher density level in group D=1 compared with D=0), and f1 (Spatial density of social and retail infrastructure (per km²); with a much lower level in group D=1 compared with D=0). In summary, the analysis shows that the huge majority of SAPARD funds were targeted to regions that as a whole were: a) strongly agriculture oriented, b) characterized by relatively good social conditions (including endowments with primary schools) and living environment (including dwellings), and c) exhibited a high level of rurality (i.e. lower spatial density of social and retail infrastructure) compared to regions with a low intensity of programme support. 29 In fact by dividing NUTS-4 regions into two groups (“supported” vs. “non-supported” regions) using above criterion we disregard the potential impact of very small SAPARD projects (i.e. below 333 thousand EUR per region). Significant differences in socio-economic and environmental characteristics of programme supported and non-supported regions prove that any direct comparisons of selected impact indicators in regions supported by the programme with respective impact indicators in non- supported regions would result in a considerable selectivity bias and thus unreliable results. The next step of the analysis aimed therefore at assessing the impact of the SAPARD programme by comparing the situation in regions supported by the SAPARD programme with a similar regions that were non-supported by the programme (thus enabling disentangling effects of the programme from other confounding factors). This was done separately for all individual SAPARD measures . Firstly, appropriate ( measure specific ) control groups were selected (e.g. selecting non-supported regions that, in terms of their characteristics, were not statistically different from the group of supported regions). Secondly, by calculating ATT indicators and applying a conditional DID method (i.e. combining ATT with DID) to the assessment of SAPARD’s impact on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) and rural unemployment. Thirdly, by computing ATE and ATU policy indicators showing the potential effectiveness of the extension of the SAPARD programme to other regions; and fourthly, by assessing the sensitivity of obtained results (impact of hidden bias).

Estimation of the propensity scores Given the individual characteristics of NUTS- 4 regions (factors f1-f21) and information about regions’ participation in the SAPARD programme (“supported” and “non-supported” regions), the propensity scores (i.e. the conditional probability of a region’s participation in the SAPARD programme) were estimated separately for all individual regions and individual measures using a logit function (1-0).

Selection of matching algorithms and testing balancing property Given the considerable differences between individual characteristics (factors f1-21) in supported and non-supported groups of regions the binary PSM matching was applied in order to find appropriate controls. The binary PSM method balances the observed covariates between the supported group and a control group based on the similarity of their predicted probabilities of receiving support (e.g. above the threshold) from the SAPARD programme. Implementing common support conditions ensures that any combination of characteristics observed in the treatment group can also be observed among the control group. In our study a common support region was imposed on both sides, i.e. by dropping treatment observations whose estimated propensity scores is higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum propensity score of the controls and vice versa (i.e. dropping control observations whose estimated propensity score is higher than maximum or lower than minimum propensity score of the treated) 30 . In case areas of common 30 This was necessary in order to estimate both ATT as well as ATE.

For programme participation measured on a per capita basis (all SAPARD measures above a threshold 600 SKK per capita), imposition of the common support condition resulted in disregarding 35 “non-comparable” regions 31 (i.e. 15 non-supported regions and 20 programme supported regions), a selection of comparable 22 regions supported by the SAPARD programme, and 15 control regions (Table 21). As the probability of observing two units with exactly the same value of propensity score is, in principle, zero, an estimation of programme effects requires using appropriate matching algorithms. The latter define the measure of proximity in order to define programme non- participants who are acceptably close (e.g. in terms of the propensity score) to any given programme participant. Given that the choice of both matching method (e.g. nearest neighbour (NN) matching, calliper matching, Gaussian kernel matching, Epanechnikov matching, etc) and selection of an appropriate matching parameter (e.g. number of nearest neighbours in NN matching, radius size in calliper matching, bandwidth size in Gaussian or Epanechnikov matching, etc.) can make a difference in small samples, and the quality of a given matching technique depends strongly on a dataset, the 31 Outside of the imposed common support area selection of a relevant matching technique in our study was carried out using the following three criteria: i) standardized bias (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); ii) t–test (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); and iii) joint significance and pseudo R² (Sianesi, 2004). Given the above criteria, the best results concerning selection of an appropriate matching algorithm were achieved by applying a two-step selection procedure. Firstly, by scaling respective matching parameters within each matching algorithm (e.g. the number of neighbours in the nearest neighbour algorithm; size of calliper in calliper matching; size of bandwidth in kernel Gaussian; size of bandwidth in kernel Epanechnikov, etc.) and applying a linear search to find those matching parameters under each matching algorithm that minimize the estimated standardized bias 32 (after matching). Secondly, by searching across all considered matching algorithms and applying the min{min} criterion as the main final selection option. In all cases (i.e. various matching algorithms) 33 an optimal solution could easily be found due to local/global convexity of the objective function with respect to adjusted matching parameters (e.g. radius magnitude 32 The standardized bias is the difference of the sample means in the treated and non-treated (full or matched) sub-samples as a percentage of the square root of the average of the sample variances in the treated and non- treated groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985). 33 This does not apply to local linear weighting function matching which first smoothes the outcome and then performs nearest neighbor matching. In this case more controls are used to calculate the counterfactual outcome than the nearest neighbor only (Leuven and Sianesi, 2007).

An overview of results from the selection procedure involving various matching algorithms is provided in Table 22. By applying the above selection procedure to our data (conditional regional participation in the SAPARD programme given covariates f1- f21) we found that a kernel matching (Gaussian bandwidth (0.28)) was that one that ensured the minimization of the standardized selection bias (after matching) and thus the highest reduction of selection bias, and at the same time satisfaction of both the balancing property test (t-test) as well as pseudo R² tests (see Tables 23 and 24). The balancing property test shows that, compared with the situation prior to the matching, application of the above matching procedure led to the selection of an appropriate control group of regions (performed t-tests confirmed the elimination of all significant differences between individual regional characteristics in both groups of regions and therefore significant reduction of the selection bias). This applies both to the differences in the RDI and all important variables (factors) determining both programme participation and programme outcomes, e.g. F4 (Agriculture and natural endowment), F1 (Spatial density of social and retail infrastructure (per km²), F6 (Spatial density of public utilities and social infrastructure, gas pipelines, water-supply- system (per km²), F9 (Hotels and recreation facilities), etc. Also other tests, e.g. pseudo R² (pseudo R² = 0.43 before matching and pseudo R²= 0.23 after matching) fully confirmed the applicability of the above approach (Table 24).

Calculation of policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, ATU) A comprehensive assessment of a programme’s impact requires separation of various programme effects of which the most important are: a) effect on regions which participated in a given programme (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated - ATT); b) effect on an average region randomly selected from the pool of programme participants and non- participants (Average Treatment Effect – ATE) and c) effect of the programme on the regions which did not participate (Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated – ATU). In our study, the above policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, and ATU) were calculated on the basis of the estimated propensity scores using the following impact indicators: a. The RDI b. Unemployment (absolute values) c. Unemployment (per capita) The results of ATT, ATE and ATU calculations are shown in Table 25. Given these parameters the programme impact was quantified using a conditional DID estimator , i.e. combining PSM (ATT, ATE, and ATU) and difference in differences (DID) methods. 9.5.5. Conditional DID estimator Application of the conditional DID estimator to the assessment of the programme impact at the regional level shows that the overall impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia on the level of regional development, as well as on rural unemployment, were negligible. In fact, our results show that in regions that obtained low support from SAPARD (i.e. Table 24: Slovakia: Results of pseudo R² tests Sample Pseudo R2 LR chi2 p>chi2 Unmatched 0.431 42.20 0.004 Matched 0.229 11.43 0.954 Table 25: Slovakia: Estimated policy evaluation parameters (per capita basis) Calculation basis RDI Unemployment (absolute) Unemployment (per capita) 2002 2005 D I D (2005 - 2002) 2002 2005 D I D (2005 - 2002) 2002 2005 D I D (2005 - 2002) Unmatched 1 ( ) .006270 .0910252 .00847552 7136 4664 -2472 .100763 .068188 -.032575 Unmatched 0 () -.12417 -.020165 .104005 6806 4587 -2219 .101956 .070347 -.031609 Difference (1-0) .130444 .1111904 -.019254 329 76 -253 -.00119 -.00215 -.00096 Matched M 1 () -.088289 -.001828 .086461 6889 4890 -1999 .10065 .071229 -.029421 Matched M 0 () -.104754 .0306261 .1353801 6406 4279 -2127 .103300 .069738 -.033562 ATT .016464 -.032455 -.048919 483 610 127 -.00264 .001490 .00413 ATU -.005894 -.057750 -.051856 507 582 75 -.00092 .002313 .003233 ATE .007400 -.042709 -.0501093 493 599 106 -.00194 .001824 .003764

This means that the impact of the SAPARD programme on a general performance (overall level of rural development and unemployment) in well-developed Slovak regions was negligible. 9.6. Impact of SAPARD programme (by measures) A slightly differentiated picture concerning the effectiveness of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia was obtained by carrying out an estimation of the programme’s impact at individual measures basis (Table 26). Our results show that out of 1-7 measures examined, only two individual SAPARD measures (i.e. Measure 1: investment in agricultural enterprises, and Measure 6: Agricultural production methods designed to protect the environment and maintain the countryside) contributed positively to the overall level of rural development in supported regions (measured in terms of the RDI). On the other hand, the implementation of the measure M5 (Forestry) was found to be highly ineffective (the RDI was negatively affected) 34 .

Out of 35 contracted projects in the forestry sector two major projects (approximately 16 Mill SKK) were suspended due to bankruptcy of contracted forest enterprises. Average amount per project under Measure 5 was the lowest from all average project costs under other measures. No result indicators under Measure 5 set in the RDP plan were monitored. No measure 5 impact indicators were set and monitored. See: Ex-post evaluation of the SAPARD programme in the Slovak Republic. P.C.M. Group, December 2007.

A s s e s s m e n t o f t h e i m p a c t o f t h e S A P A R D p r o g r a m m e i n S l o v a k i a In terms of the impact of SAPARD measures on rural unemployment, Measures 4a, 4b, 5, and 7 were found to have a positive impact on the reduction of rural unemployment (measured both in absolute terms and per capita basis). Measure 4a had an especially positive impact on the reduction of rural unemployment (Investments not involving infrastructure) that was mainly focused on support of local agro-tourist facilities. On the other hand, due to the introduction of technological advancements, implementation of SAPARD measures M1 (investment in agricultural enterprises), M2 (investment in food processing) and M6 (environmental investments) had a negative impact on unemployment, i.e. the above measures were found to lead to an increase of rural unemployment. 9.7. Assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme using a generalized propensity score and dose-response function approach The application of a generalized propensity score matching and dose-response function approach is particularly advantageous if the huge majority of regions, or all regions, are subject to support from the programme (low number or no D=0). Additionally, the GPS approach allows questions relating to marginal programme effects to be answered (by linking programme impacts to the level of programme intensity). Application of the GPSM methodology to the analysis of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia was carried out using information about programme intensity on a per region and per capita basis. The four main steps were: a) estimation of the treatment function; b) calculation of the GPS and carrying out balancing tests; c) modelling conditional expectations of the programme outcome; and d) calculation of the dose-response and derivative dose-response functions. 9.7.1.

Calculation of GPS and balancing property tests Obtained estimates (9.7.1.) were used to calculate region specific propensity scores (prior to the programme) according to eq 15. Testing of the balancing properties for covariates was performed using a method proposed in Hirano and Imbens (2004), i.e. by blocking on both the treatment variables (e.g. programme intensity per capita) and on the estimated GPS. Given GPS and various intensity levels of the SAPARD programme support per region (on per capita basis), the balancing property test (t-test) was carried out for all variables f1-f21 in pre-specified blocks of GPS (=2) and programme intensity levels (=3), i.e. by testing if for each GPS block the covariate means of regions belonging to the group of the particular intensity level of programme support are significantly different from those of regions with a different intensity level of support, but similar GPS level. The results of the t-tests developed in Bia and Mattei (2007) showed that balancing property was satisfied for all variables, GPS blocks and intensity levels. 9.7.3. Modelling the conditional expectation of the programme outcome and dose- response function Given Ti and estimated GPS (Ri) for each of the NUTS-4 regions in Slovakia, the conditional expectation of the programme outcome measured in terms of the RDI (Y = ∆ RDI) was modelled as a flexible function of its two arguments (Ti and Ri) according to eq (18) (polynomial quadratic function).

Imbens, 2004), the estimated regression function is later used to estimate of the causal effects of the SAPARD programme (average programme effects and marginal outcome of programme support at particular level T). The dose-response function (DRF) was computed as the average potential outcome for each level of treatment according to eq 16. The marginal programme effects were estimated means a derivative dose-response function E[Y(t+1) - Y(t)]. The bootstrap methods were applied to obtain standard errors that take into account the estimation of GPS and the parameters of the estimated conditional expectation of the outcome function. Results of the estimated dose- response and derivative dose-response function are shown in Table 28. Application of the GPS and the dose- response function to the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia primarily confirms the results obtained by using the binary PSM method, i.e. it proves that the impact of SAPARD measures (total funds) on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) across Slovak regions was generally negligible (or negative), except for those regions which received programme support between 260-780 SKK per capita (positive dose- response function). Apparently, the positive impact on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) of two SAPARD measures M6 (Agricultural production methods designed to protect environment and maintain the countryside) and M1 (modernization of agricultural enterprises), could not overcompensate some negative effects stemming from implementation of other SAPARD measures, especially M5 (forestry). More positive impacts of all SAPARD measures were found on a reduction of rural unemployment. Obviously, reduction of the number of unemployed caused by measures M4a (Investments not involving infrastructure, mainly in agro-tourism), M7 (Land improvement and re-parcelling), M4b (Investments in rural infrastructure not bringing substantial revenues) and M5 (forestry) overcompensated an increase of unemployment caused by measures: M1 (Investment in agricultural enterprises), M2 (Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products, mainly investment in food industry), and M6 (Agricultural production methods designed to protect environment and maintain the countryside). Our results show that in those regions that received programme support between 259- 1573 SKK per capita, the impact of the SAPARD programme on rural unemployment was positive (i.e. SAPARD funds contributed to a reduction in the number of unemployed persons). While the highest reduction of rural unemployment was found in regions with programme intensity in the range between 402-998 SKK per capita, the effectiveness of the programme intensity above 2280 SKK per capita (the highest support level) and those below 90 SKK per capita (i.e. the lowest support level) was found to be negative (i.e. in those regions the SAPARD programme contributed to an increase in the number of unemployment persons). 
70 1 0 . C o n c l u s i o n s 10. Conclusions The basic objective of this study was to analyze the impact of EU RD programmes on rural regions. Aggregated effects of a given RD programme at regional levels were estimated using the Rural Development Index (RDI) – a proxy describing the overall quality of life in individual rural areas. The weights of economic, social and environmental domains entering the RDI index (composite indicator) were derived empirically from the econometrically estimated intra- and inter-regional migration function after selecting the “best” model from various alternative model specifications (e.g. panel estimate logistic regression nested error structure model, spatial effect models, etc). The impacts of individual RD measures were analysed by means of a counterfactual analysis by applying combination of the binary Propensity Score Matching (PSM) (e.g. Kernel matching) and difference-in-differences (DID) methods (i.e. by comparing supported regions and matched control group, prior to the programme and after it). Evaluation of programme effects (by programme measures) at regional level is carried out on the basis of the estimated policy parameters: Average Treatment Effects (ATE), Average Treatment on Treated (ATT) and Average Treatment on Untreated (ATU) effects by using the RDI Index and unemployment ratios as impact indicators. Given information on regional intensity to programme exposure (financial input flows by regions) the overall impact of obtained support via a given RD programme was estimated by means of a dose-response function and derivative dose- response function within the framework of a generalized propensity score matching (GPS). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum bounds) was carried out in order to assess a possible influence of unobservables on obtained results (under a binary PSM methodology). Above methodologies were empirically applied to evaluation of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Poland and Slovakia in years 2002-2005 at NUTS-4 level. Our results show that the application of the GPS and the dose response function to the assessment of the impact of a given RD programme using the RDI combined with other partial indicators as an impact measure enables a more precise estimation of the effects of the given programme, compared with traditional “naive” evaluation techniques or methodologies based on binary PSM methods. The major advantages from applying the RDI as an impact indicator in the framework of a generalized propensity score approach to the evaluation of RD programmes are as follows: • The approach allows for considering of all potential effects of a given RD programme (aggregated or separated by programme measures) on various rural development domains (economic, social, environmental, etc.) and on the overall quality of life of population living in individual rural areas. • The approach incorporates (implicitly) numerous general equilibrium effects of a programme, e.g. multiplier effects, substitution effects, into the analysis. • While the weights applied into the construction of the RDI represent society’s valuation of endowments and socio- economic trends observable at local/regional levels (estimated weights are representative for society as whole i.e. reflect both the decision of the migrating population and of the population that stays in the region) an application of the above weighting system allows for a more comprehensive assessment

Especially promising is the possibility of the estimation of the average and marginal potential outcomes that correspond to specific values of continuous programme doses (i.e. for each level of programme support) by means of a dose-response and derivative dose-response functions. Here, programme impacts are linked to the level of programme intensity. • An essential advantage of the proposed methodology is that GPS method eliminates (or at least substantially reduces) selection bias and allows to estimate individual programme effects not only in “average” terms, but also for different programme support intensity levels (!). • The above evaluation methodology permits testing a number of common stipulations, e.g. positive effect of a given policy on various indicators of regional performance, e.g. employment, labour productivity, environmental and social indicators, etc. • The major weakness is that the above method requires an abundant and good quality data (available at regional levels) and considerable technical skills on side of its users (e.g. programme evaluators). Clearly, the above methodology is highly applicable both for analysis of effects of RD as well as structural programmes at a regional level, and is powerful both at the aggregated level (e.g. NUTS 2) as well as NUTS 3 or NUTS 4 levels.

At a major conference in Lisbon on 17 and 18 March, not only were the new programmes inaugurated but a process of reflection was initiated on the future of lifelong training and closer links were proposed between education and employment policies.

Editoria European Union government leaders held a special meeting in March to agree a new strategic goal for the next decade: to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. Dubbed the dot.com summit and described by the Portuguese presidency as «a true revolution in the methods of the European Union», this informal Lisbon European Council called fora comprehensive eEurope Action Plan to be formally adopted in June. A key part of that plan is the eLearning initiative, a set of concrete proposals spearheaded by Viviane Reding, Commissioner for Education and Culture, and designed to make the most of the opportunities presented by information and communication technologies for education, train­ ing and lifelong learning in Europe. The eLearning initiative contains four main elements: providing all schools with adequate multimedia equipment; training at all levels in the use of electronic learning technology; developing good quality European multimedia educational content and services; and a drive to accelerate the interconnection of teach­ ing and training establishments, helping to develop them into centres for acquiring knowledge. At the same time, accompanying the eLearning initiative, the new Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes are rapidly getting under way for a seven­year period ­ five years in the case of Culture 2000 ­ during which the EU will undertake its greatest expansion ever. Our programmes will continue to set the pattern for educational, training and youth exchanges between more than 30 European countries, including all the Member States and candidate countries, and further afield in the broader international context. In terms of mobility alone they should provide opportunities to learn abroad for up to 2 million people. These undertakings represent great challenges for the EU and for the Commission's services, particularly for the Directorate­General for Education and Culture ­ DG EAC. A year ago in Le Magazine, my predecessor David O'Sullivan wrote of the impending reorganization of the Commission and the difficulties which we hoped would shortly be behind us. As regards DG EAC, the restructuring is accomplished and we now have a tightly organized, fully operational new Commission department. Our areas of responsibility are wide­ranging. They truly reflect the diversity of a European Union closer to its citizens and responsive to their many concerns and interests. The contents of this issue of Le Magazine reflect that range and diversity, from education to 'dialogue with the citizen', from vocational training to audiovisual policy, from youth policy to digital literacy in the use of modern technologies.

Education, Training, Youth On the initiative of the Portuguese presidency, and with the support of the European Commission, a major conference was held in Lisbon on 17 and 18 March to launch the new phase of three Community programmes: Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Youth. This new generation of programmes will run for seven years (2000-2006), receive a budget of €3.52 billion and involve no fewer than 2 million citizens. Education, training and youth ministers from the 31 countries now eligible to participate in these programmes attended the conference. Malta and Turkey were both represented for the first time. The Portuguese organizers wanted to take this opportunity to look ahead to future prospects for lifelong education and training. Preparations for the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March on employment and the knowledge society were also on the agenda. The education ministers held a special meeting in Lisbon on 18 March to agree proposals to be submitted to the summit, and these were largely adopted by the heads of state and government in their conclusions. The Portuguese President and Prime Minister also participated in the Lisbon conference, underlining the importance they assign to education, training and youth policies.

Lisbon conference The education ministers of the 15 EU Member States met on the fringes of the Lisbon conference to discuss the role of education and training in employment policies in general, and more specifically their contribution to the special Lisbon Council on 23 and 24 March. The message was heard. In their conclusions, the heads of state and government at the summit gave particular priority to the education ministers' proposals. Education ministers speak out The proposals of the Portuguese presidency The education ministers focused on three concrete pro­ posals formulated by the Portuguese presidency: • The establishment of a common reference framework for basic skills. • The transformation of educational and training estab­ lishments into open learning centres able to work with a range of publics and partners to provide appropriate training. • The implementation of flexible validation and certifi­ cation systems for skills acquired in different contexts (for example, by identifying key elements to be in­ cluded in a standardized European curriculum vitae). The messages from the ministers The meeting produced three key messages: • The development of a knowledge and innovation soci­ ety is essential to launching a process of genuine eco­ nomic and social renewal in Europe. Innovation and knowledge are decisive factors for the EU's competi­ tiveness and its ability to combat the scourge of un­ employment. Investment in human resources has be­ come an essential condition for lasting economic and social success. Education and training are key ele­ ments in promoting active citizenship and a society based on social inclusion. • Lifelong education and training play a leading role in Europe's employment strategy. This is why the Educa­ tion Council should be more closely involved in the Luxembourg process (1). A system of reference and performance indicators should be introduced, espe­ cially in the field of lifelong education and training and the quality of education and training. • A command of information and communication tech­ nologies is crucially important in the new knowledge society. Schools must be quicker to enter the digital age. The Commission's eLearning initiative could play a major role in this respect (2). The conclusions of the special Council The special European Council of 23 and 24 March in Lis­ bon, unanimously seen as a success, sought to set a new strategic objective for the Union with the aim of rein­ forcing employment, economic reform and social cohe­ sion as part of a knowledge­based economy. It was the first time such a summit had placed education and train­ ing matters at the top of the agenda. The special summit drew up six precise proposals: • substantially to increase the per capita investment in human resources every year; • to reduce by one half, by 2010, the number of people aged between 18 and 24 who do not complete the first cycle of secondary education and who do not un­ dertake any further education or training; • to take the necessary steps to ensure that training centres ­ all of which should have Internet access ­ develop into polyvalent open learning centres using methods suited to a wide diversity of target groups; to set up partnerships between schools, learning centres, companies and research bodies so that knowledge ac­ quisition is of benefit to all; • to adopt a European framework defining the new basic abilities which must be accessible to all through lifelong education and training: IT skills, foreign languages, technological culture, a spirit of enterprise, and social skills; to introduce a European diploma for basic IT skills awarded on a decentral­ ized basis, in order to promote digital culture throughout the Union; • to define, by the end of 2000, ways to encourage mo­ bility among students, teachers, trainers and re­ searchers through the optimal use of the existing Community programmes (Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, Youth), the removal of obstacles and increased trans­ parency in the recognition of qualifications and peri­ ods of study and training; to take steps to remove ob­ stacles to the mobility of teachers by 2002 and to attract quality teachers; • to develop a common European model for curricula vi­ tae to be used voluntarily to promote mobility by making it easier for education and training establish­ ments and employers to assess skills. Furthermore, as a means of encouraging an active em­ ployment policy, the European Council called for greater efforts to involve excluded groups in working life, and for more importance to be placed on lifelong learning. The Luxembourg process is based on the drawing­up of Community employment guidelines and their transposition into national employ­ ment plans. See eLearning article on p. 13 Le Magazine ■ #13 ■ 2000 
Lisbon conference In plenary session and at workshops, the education, training and youth ministers from the 31 countries participating in the programmes came together with representatives of associations and the European social partners to consider the future of lifelong education and training. What concrete measures can be taken to encourage it? How can everyone benefit? What impact will it have on employment? How should competitiveness be pursued without putting social solidarity at risk? Here are some of the answers given on 17 and 18 March. Lifelong learning: the same right for all Our societies are changing faster than ever before and now lie at a strategic crossroads. Knowledge and innova­ tion have become essential resources for economic de­ velopment. But while generating wealth, this knowledge society also has the potential to exclude. The EU must aim to be not only an economically competitive area, but also ­ and the two are inextricably linked ­ a social enti­ ty with which its citizens identify. It is in this context that lifelong education is of such major importance. As the Lisbon conference stressed, the task is to make the econ­ omy more competitive, develop social cohesion and pro­ mote active citizenship. To achieve this, all citizens must have real opportunities. Access to lifelong training and education must be guar­ anteed for all: from young to elderly people, from work­ ers made redundant through industrial restructuring to the unemployed and/or unskilled, and ultimately all those seeking self­improvement. People who are socially excluded or threatened with exclusion also demand spe­ cial attention. The answers must be as diverse as the needs of the individuals in question. Each group, each situation requires its own approach. The importance of basic education How can we promote lifelong learning as a universal right? The need to strengthen each link in the educa­ tional chain was foremost among the preconditions highlighted. Basic education and initial training are fundamental. It is in the very beginning, starting at primary school, that people must "learn to learn" and be stimulated to want to do so. Informal education also makes a contribution, and in particular, teaching practices aimed at young people. It is at this age that they learn to work in a group and acquire the social skills important in the context of lifelong edu­ cation. A young person who undertakes voluntary work and assumes responsibility for others, for example, de­ velops specific abilities which should count when he or she applies for a job. This would in turn benefit employ­ ment and social integration. Closer integration Connections between formal education and training and informal education must be reinforced. As education, so­ cial issues and the economy become more closely inte­ grated, differences between education and training are tending to disappear. Lifelong learning transforms the very concept of education and training, transmitting a comprehensive set of life and vocational skills. This ap­ proach promotes interdisciplinarity, project work, team­ work, the practice of citizenship and access to working life. At the organizational level, there must be greater syner­ gy between education and training sites. Universities could make their facilities available for adult education, for example. Schools could build partnerships with local youth clubs. Generally speaking, the debate on the role of the educa­ tion system as a whole must involve all players in the ed­ ucation community and the social partners. Local com­ munities, the labour force and employers must all be involved in helping excluded people to get back into school or work. Making the most of the skills acquired If they are to invest in knowledge, it is important for people to know that what they learn ­ throughout their lives ­ will be fully recognized. As the Lisbon conference stressed, this requires a better validation of the skills ac­ quired, both formally and informally. Given the huge number of vocational qualifications currently available in Europe, the sheer complexity of the problem is clear. There is a need, in this respect, to distinguish between the transparency of qualifications and their certification, each resulting from different procedures. Schools must take more account of what happens in the world outside. Involvement in the community should be recognised as a process which also develops new skills. A common frame­ work of basic abilities must be defined, but carefully, and without seeking to harmonize education systems. The recognition of skills concerns young people just as much as older people. Some workers with few diplomas have extensive experience which should be better acknowl­ edged. The Lisbon conference also stressed the benefits of en­ couraging European mobility in the framework of life­ long learning. Mobility allows Europe to draw closer to its citizens. It creates new skills, both social and voca­ tional. It also promotes knowledge and understanding of other cultures. These are all major advantages for profes­ sional integration and active citizenship. Mobility should start as early as possible, even in prima­ ry school. The twinning of schools, for example, would be a foundation for building mutual understanding and ar­ ranging exchange visits. But again, the skills acquired through mobility must be fully recognized. The challenge of the new technologies The conference participants drew attention to the key role of the new information and communication tech­ nologies (ICTs) in promoting and furnishing more flexible lifelong education and training. No one ­ whether school pupil, adult or teacher ­ should be denied access. All schools must be equipped. Hence the importance of Eu­ ropean Commissioner Viviane Reding's recently launched eLearning initiative, designed to speed up the equipping of schools and training centres. The new ICTs pose a number of challenges. Teachers and trainers must themselves be trained in how to use them. The teaching value of the tools available must also be guaranteed. The conference drew attention to the Inter­ net's potential role in encouraging discussion and influ­ encing policies relating to active citizenship. One work­ shop participant asked why, for example, the Internet could not be the forum for a major debate on the forth­ coming White Paper on youth policies in Europe. The point was also made that education and lifelong learning should be seen as a universal right. That presup­ poses having the resources to match the objectives, plus concrete encouragement. The conference put forward the idea that responsibility should be shared between governments, employers and individuals. Public authori­ ties should first make available the basic resources. Com­ panies must then help to co­finance learning actions, by means of "time credit" systems, for example. They should be encouraged to reconcile learning with work organiza­ tion and working time: another argument for the close involvement of the social partners. These efforts should not be seen as "costs" but as an investment, bringing re­ wards in the future. Finally, there is a need to motivate the individuals directly concerned. Strengthening the synergies between the three programmes The participants at the Lisbon conference welcomed the three new programmes (Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Youth) as essential contributions to the process of life­ long education and training. These programmes allow Le Magazine ■ #13 · 2000 
young people in particular to understand the notion of a pluralist Europe, develop their powers of observation and communication, fulfil their personal potential, and to look at their own country with different eyes. In this respect they stressed the benefits of the opportu­ nities brought by the "joint actions" between the pro­ grammes. But they also made the point that this cooper­ ation should be taken further by creating synergies between the three Community programmes and the Structural Funds, in particular the European Social Fund, and also with the Fifth Framework Programme for Re­ search and Technological Development. There should be greater cooperation at national and European level be­ tween the programmes and the bodies responsible for their implementation. Students, teachers, pupils and so­ cial partners could all be more closely involved in devel­ oping and implementing these three programmes. What they said... • Viviane Reding, European Commissioner "The new programmes will directly affect 2 million citizens" Viviane Reding, European Commissioner responsible for education and culture, stressed the historical dimension of the Lisbon conference: "The first event bringing to­ gether the education, training and youth ministers from all 31 European countries to which our action pro­ grammes are open." "I note with pleasure," she said, "that the Portuguese presidency has also invited representa­ tives of the social partners at European level and the most eminent European associations, testifying to the priority we award to all the actors in the field and the citizens directly affected by our policies." She stated that these three programmes will be receiving a budget of €3.52 billion for seven years, representing more than a 30% increase on the previous period. "This shows very clearly the general acceptance of the added value of our programmes and their contribution to cre­ ating a citizens' Europe." Since 1995, she continued, more than 1 million people have benefited from the opportunities these pro­ grammes offer. For the period 2000­2006, the aim of Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Youth will be to reach 2 million. The Commissioner then drew attention to the fact that this conference to launch the programmes was being held at a particularly opportune moment: one week be­ fore the Lisbon European Council which would confirm the leading role of innovation and knowledge in making the Union more competitive and in combating unem­ ployment. Having explained that lifelong learning was a central priority in the three new programmes, Viviane Reding ended by affirming that "education and training policy is the principal means for constructing a Europe of knowledge in which citizens are closely involved." • Jorge Sampaio, President of the Portuguese Republic "The meaning of Europe... » Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio spoke at the con­ ference's opening ceremony. "Training, youth and educa­ tion policies," he pointed out, "are decisive in building a European area in which human rights and cultural diver­ sity are becoming increasingly important... Today, the major challenge is to make the youngest generations feel the meaning of Europe and its values." There was a need to act, every day, "with courage and rigour, so that Eu­ rope will be viewed as a valuable asset. We must act to ensure that cultural diversity is perceived as a positive factor. We must work to create a tolerant and cohesive society." • António Guterres, Prime Minister of Portugal "A more competitive and cohesive society" The knowledge­based economy has become the principal source of wealth creation, but it is also a potential factor for exclusion, argued António Guterres at the conference closing session. "But it is possible to act for a society that is both more competitive and more cohesive." The Por­ tuguese prime minister also stressed that "every organi­ zation in our social fabric, our education and training systems, must guarantee citizens the right to lifelong learning." ■ All about education, on­line What is the state of European research on preventing failure at school? What percentage of young girls take higher education science courses in the United Kingdom? What language courses are available in Madrid and Barcelona? Every day, the experts and the general public ask countless questions about education in Europe. But the sheer number of existing information sources often makes gathering data a frustrating task. To correct the problem, the European Commission is putting all its energies into a truly innovative pilot pro­ ject, the outlines of which were presented at the Lisbon conference. Known as the "Gateway" project, it aims to provide a unique portal for access to all information on the European learning area, via the Internet. The Gate­ way will function as a guide to existing sources. It will not replace other websites, but will make them more valuable by rendering them more accessible. The project was initiated by two of the European Com­ mission's services: ­ the Education and Culture Directorate­General, re­ sponsible for content and, ultimately, managing the Gateway; ­ the Joint Research Centre, responsible for the techni­ cal aspects of developing a prototype. A feasibility study is currently being carried out and will be finished in October. The system itself should be up and running for the summer of 2001.

At the end of last year, the European Union agreed a new procedure for developing policy in the field of education and training, based on the principle of a 'rolling agenda'. The initiative should enhance cooperation and ensure continuity from one EU Presidency to another. But how is it being implemented? Rolling agenda to speed up progress on education The rolling agenda is a new structure for the future work of the Education Council (EU education ministers) and of other bodies dealing with education and train­ ing, such as the Advisory Committee for Vocational Training (national experts). It will change the way the Council deals with ongoing issues, strengthening the impact of work and reinforcing cooperation at Euro­ pean level. The use of a rolling agenda within the Education Coun­ cil has been considered for some time. At the initiative of the Finnish presidency, with the support of the Com­ mission, the proposal was formally accepted last No­ vember when the Council adopted a Resolution on de­ veloping new working procedures for European cooperation in the field of education and training. The Resolution aims to make the work of the Council on education and training issues more coherent by making sure that issues are dealt with on a rolling basis, with the Council coming back to them at regular intervals. Indi­ vidual presidencies will continue to set their own agen­ das and priorities, but in future they should do this with­ in the context of the rolling agenda and in close cooperation with each other and with the Commission. The importance of cooperation and continuity in gener­ al is something which is strongly emphasised by the Council Resolution, as they underpin many aspects of the process. The basic structure of the rolling agenda can be broken down into a number of steps: ■ Firstly, the Education Council discusses priority themes which are of common interest to the Member States, and decides on the best way of taking them forward; ■ Member States then inform the Commission about activities at national level in connection with the themes agreed; ■ When it has received this information from all Mem­ ber States, the Commission analyses it and produces a summary for the Education Council; ■ The Council then looks at this summary and decides if and how it should be followed up. The same principles are central to the 'open method of coordination' presented by the Portuguese Presidency at the extraordinary European Council meeting in Lis­ bon on 23­24 March. The Resolution proposed three themes within the field of education and training which will form the initial basis of the rolling agenda. These are: ■ the role of education and training in employment policies; ■ the quality of education and training at all levels; ■ mobility, including the recognition of qualifications. The importance of the above themes was reaffirmed by the European Council at its meeting in Lisbon, when it called for increased action and cooperation in these ar­ eas. For each of the three priority themes, the Commis­ sion ­ in particular DG Education and Culture ­ is con­ sidering how the rolling agenda can actually be put into place, and which steps should be taken within each area so that the process is as productive as possible. This re­ quires close cooperation with other services, such as DG Employment, who have an interest in the priority areas chosen. There have already been discussions, within the Com­ mission, the Education Committee, the Advisory Com­ mittee for Vocational Training and the Directors Gen­ eral for Vocational Training, about how to put the rolling agenda into practice. This new method for structuring the work of the Council has been widely welcomed. ■ New programmes: Lift-off We finally have lift­off. After Leonardo da Vinci and Socrates, agreement has been reached on Youth. Which means the three new programmes (2000­2006) are well and truly launched. The last issue of Le Magazine presented the substance of the main changes. We now bring concrete details and useful information on how the programmes will be implemented during this transitional year. Youth: start­up Slightly behind schedule, the Youth programme was fi­ nally given the go­ahead in April following the agree­ ment reached, on 29 February, between the European Parliament and Council. Youth will indeed run for seven years (2000­2006) and will have a total budget of €520 million. This represents considerable progress: Youth for Europe was allocated €126 million for the previous five years (1995­1999) and European Voluntary Service €47.5 million for 1998/1999. The Youth programme was finally approved by the Euro­ pean Parliament and Council before Easter. Its publica­ tion in the Official Journal of the European Communities in May marks the programme's effective entry into force. On 18 and 19 April, a meeting of the Youth Committee endorsed the rules and priorities for implementing the programme. These include, in particular: ­ the development of multilateral exchanges (minimum 3 partners) ­ more host sites for volunteers ­the participation of young people encountering prob­ lems of access to Community programmes, for example by means of bilateral exchanges or short EVS activities (from 3 weeks) ­ the opening up of EVS activities to countries on track for EU membership ­increased cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin (Euro­Med). New financial regulations have also been agreed. In fu­ ture, most projects under this programme ­ which tend to be small ­ will essentially receive lump­sum funding. Previously, the rule was to award a (variable) percentage of the total cost. This new system will be to everyone's benefit. Life will be easier for the project promoters who will be better able to plan income and expenditure. At the same time the national agencies set up in the Mem­ ber States to manage a large number of projects will be Le Magazine · #13 ■ 2000 
relieved of excessively burdensome administrative tasks, as will the European Commission. The time saved can be usefully employed in monitoring project quality, giving advice, site visits, etc. Due to the programme's late adoption, special arrange­ ments apply as regards deadlines for the submission of projects in 2000. An initial deadline for submitting applications according to the rules which applied for the former programmes (the forms, the financing, etc.) was set for 1 May 2000 for all the Youth actions. The next three deadlines, name­ ly 1 June, 1 September and 1 November, apply both to decentralized activities (exchanges, EVS, youth initia­ tives, certain support measures) and other activities (Euro­Med projects, third­country projects, support measures, multilateral projects). All this information is included in the user's guide, avail­ able in the European Union's 11 official languages from the national agencies or from the Internet site at: eu­ ropa, eu.int/comm/education/youth.html (which also gives the particulars of the national agencies). In addition, there are two calls for projects relating to training, information and cooperation activities for which the Commission will publish and circulate a spe­ cific document. The deadline for the first is June, and for the second September. The contact at the European Commission is: Pierre Mairesse, Education and Culture DG F+ 32 2 299 40 38 youth@cec.eu.int Leonardo da Vinci : six priorities The first call for proposals for the Leonardo da Vinci pro­ gramme, for the period 2000­2002, was published in the Official Journal (C 23/7) on 27 January 2000. The next deadline for submitting applications is 19 January 2001. The Commission sets six priorities in its call for proposals: 1. Ability to participate in working life: to improve the quality of education and vocational training systems and guidance services as well as access to training and qualifications, with the aim of promoting the em­ ployability of young people and adults. 2. Partnership: to promote cooperation between train­ ing establishments at all levels and companies (SMEs in particular) and the social partners in order to make the training more relevant and effective. 3. Social inclusion: to promote equal access to training and the inclusion of disadvantaged people in the labour market, and to combat discrimination. 4. Adaptability and entrepreneurship: to promote in­ vestment in human resources as company strategy with the aim of improving the ability to adapt to technological and organizational change. 5. New technologies: to make the most of the potential of the information and communication technologies (ICTs) in training 6. Transparency: to improve the transparency of qualifi­ cations. All projects must relate to one of these priorities and contribute to the realization of at least one of the pro­ gramme's objectives. It must also be in keeping with the programme's more general philosophy of promoting in­ novation and improving the quality of training practices and systems through transnational cooperation now widened to include 31 countries. The role of the national agencies is to inform, advise and assist project promoters in their search for partners. Their particulars and details of the documents required when preparing a proposal (in particular the promoter's guide, the specific guides for each of the measures, and the ap­ plication forms) are available on the Internet site: http://europa.eu.int/comm/education/leonardo.html Socrates: forthcoming deadlines The decision on the new Socrates programme was final­ ly taken by the European Parliament and Council on 24 January 2000. Given that it proved impossible to offi­ cially draw up the documents for implementing the sec­ ond phase of Socrates in 1999, arrangements have been made for a two­stage transition, in 2000 and 2001. The general principle is as follows: in 2000 all the Socrates actions which already existed under the programme's first phase will.continue to be managed as before. Total­ ly new actions will nevertheless come into force in this first year ­ such as the inclusion of part of Lingua in Comenius and the decentralization of teacher exchanges under Erasmus. So what are the forthcoming deadlines for submitting proposals? Comenius ­ school partnerships: 1 March 2001 ­ cooperation projects for teaching staff: 1 March 2001 ­ individual grants for training education staff: 1 March 2001 (for Comenius language assistants, 1 February 2001) and 1 November 2001 ­ Comenius networks: 1 November 2000 Erasmus ­ Inter­university cooperation: 1 November 2000 ­Student and teacher mobility: contact the university concerned ­ Erasmus thematic networks: 1 November 2000 Grundtvig ­ European cooperation projects: 1 November 2000 ­ Educational partnerships: 1 March 2001 ­ Mobility for the training of education staff: 1 March 2001 and I November 2001 ­ Grundtvig networks: 1 November 2000 Lingua and Minerva : 1 November 2000 The Socrates guide for candidates, which is valid for sev­ eral years, is available from the national agencies or from the Internet site at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/educa­ tion/socrates.html This site also presents full programme details. ■ Le Magazine ■ #13 · 2000 
φ·· The Culture 2000 framework programme, adopted for a period of five years (2000­2004) by the European Parliament and the Council on 14 February, entered into force on 10 March 2000.' The task for the Commission now is to implement it effectively and ensure that the programme and projects are better managed than previous cultural programmes. The Culture 2 0 00 programme: adoption, implementation and priorities Reus (Spain) Casa Navas (1901­1907) architect Lluis Domenèch i Montaner Vienna ­ close­up monument, by Otto Wagner The challenge is to streamline procedures and to exercise stricter control over the timetable to prevent cultural operators receiving their support too late, often long af­ ter their cultural event is over and done with. The programme's main aim is to help and encourage cit­ izens and cultural organizations to set up cultural coop­ eration projects with a strong European dimension and added value. A first call for proposals has already been published, inviting cultural operators to submit projects as early as possible so as to enable the Commission to or­ ganize the selection process, obtain the budgetary re­ sources before August, and make the first payments be­ fore November. This is an exceptional situation caused by the pro­ gramme's late adoption. It should not be repeated in 2001 as the Commission staff responsible for culture have taken the precaution of proposing to the manage­ ment committee that the call for proposals for 2001 should be made in May this year. This will allow the se­ lection process to be completed before the end of 2000 and the first payments to be made before projects start. The ready availability of appropriate information adapt­ ed to Europe's various cultures is inconceivable without the presence of the Cultural Contact Points. Although they have existed for a number of years already, in the Culture 2000 programme their information role is more clearly defined. The call for proposals was quickly launched An announcement of the forthcoming call for proposals and the text of the decision establishing the programme were published on the Internet as early as 18 February. On 22 February this information was published in the Of­ ficial Journal in all languages. At the beginning of April, the call for proposals was published in the Official Jour­ nal and made immediately available on the Internet. This early warning allowed cultural operators to prepare for the call for proposals and to develop and programme their cultural cooperation projects based on a transna­ tional partnership. Priority for concrete cultural projects For the year 2000, priority will be awarded to projects for concrete cultural productions, such as publications, fes­ tivals, exhibitions or restoration works aimed at the widest possible audience, including young people. Spe­ cial attention will also be given to the underprivileged sections of society. Action 1 of the programme will give priority to concrete projects in the sectors of architectural and cultural her­ itage, books and the visual and plastic arts which aim to provide further training, improve the mobility of artists and their works, exchange best practice (on the restora­ tion and promotion of architectural heritage from the 19 ,h and 20 lh centuries), highlight major literary trends, translate literary works by European authors from the latter half of the 20 th century, assist the study of cultur­ al and architectural heritage in schools and elsewhere, and raise awareness of art as well as improve access to artistic and cultural practices, in particular by making use of new technologies.

Further information Jean­Michel Courades, Education and Culture DG F+ 32 2 299 92 83 Action 2 of the programme will give priority to cultural cooperation agreements concluded in the music sector (either to develop musical heritage or to promote new forms of musical expression). Priority will also be given to multidisciplinary cultural cooperation agreements aimed at encouraging the study and mutual knowledge of the cultural history of the peoples of Europe. Finally, for Action 3, priority will be given to the Euro­ pean Cities of Culture (about €2 million) and the Euro­ pean heritage laboratories ­ with particular attention being given to developing projects in zones affected by natural disasters or damaged by environmental pollu­ tion. Cultural Contact Points ­ a sharper definition of their information role According to the decision establishing the Culture 2000 programme and the terms of the agreements to be signed with each of them, the Cultural Contact Points must: ■ Promote the programme, in particular by satisfying the public demand for information; ensuring wide­ spread publicity (throughout the participating country in question) for Community support mechanisms in the field of culture; and widely disseminating calls for proposals and any other document aimed at the cul­ tural sector published by the Commission's Education and Culture Directorate­General. This implies setting up and regularly updating a database of cultural orga­ nizations active in the territory they cover. ■ Facilitate the participation of the greatest number of cultural professionals in the programme by giving them appropriate information on the procedures for making grants under the Community cultural pro­ gramme. This will include disseminating appropriate information on paper and through the Internet and organizing meetings with potential participants to provide information on the procedures for submitting applications. ■ Liaise with the various national institutions which provide particular support for the cultural sector, thus helping make Culture 2000 actions complementary with national support measures. ■ Provide contact and interaction at the national and regional levels between participants in the Culture 2000 programme and participants in other Communi­ ty programmes open to cultural projects. ■ Maintain a link with the other information bodies in the Member States so as to stay up to date with the activities of other Community programmes with a bearing on culture, and direct applicants to the pro­ grammes best suited to their needs. Preparatory actions in 1999 In 1999, a "life­size" test was carried out in managing the Culture 2000 programme. The Commission made a finan­ cial contribution to 55 cultural projects of €6.07 million following a call for proposals modelled on the principles and criteria of the future framework programme. Out of the 410 applications received at the close of a one­month period, the Commission selected 55 on the advice of a committee of independent experts represent­ ing various cultural disciplines. The experimental actions were used to test a new method of evaluating projects on the basis of specific criteria (cultural quality, European added value, innova­ tive nature, multiplier effect). Two lessons may be drawn from the experience The first lesson to be drawn from the experimental ac­ tions is the ability of the European cultural area to de­ velop cultural cooperation projects in large numbers: 410 projects were submitted despite the fact that cultural operators were allowed just one month to do so and that the Raphael, Kaleidoscope and Ariane programmes had already generated more than a thousand projects. A clear majority of projects (65%) were presented as specific non­multiannual projects (action 1), whereas multian­ nual actions within cooperation agreements (action 2) accounted for just 20% of projects. For the year 2000, the Culture 2000 project can be reasonably expected to receive between 1,000 and 2,000 projects. The second lesson to be drawn is that the performance arts and dance, theatre and music in particular (36% for action 1 ; 30% for action 2) are over­represented com­ pared to other sectors such as books and literature (5.7% for action 1 ; 6.8% for action 2), the visual and plastic arts (9.75% for action 1 ; 7.5% for action 2) or heritage (9% for action 1 ; 12.5% for action 2). In this connection, the decision establishing the pro­ gramme stipulates that the specific needs of the various sectors of cultural life must be taken into account in a balanced way when distributing funds. Full information on the subjects covered in this article is available on the Internet site at http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/index_en.html Two examples of projects supported in 1999 under the framework programme's preparatory actions (http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/1999_en.html) For wider theatre access (action 1: specific innovative and/or experimental actions) What can be done to encourage people who are hard of hearing to enjoy the performing arts, and the theatre in particular? Four professional organi­ zations ­ from Austria, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands ­ are working on the use of sign lan­ guage in live performances as part of a joint ap­ proach to promote access for the hard of hearing to dramatic art in Europe. At a series of workshops and symposia, hearing artists will work with the deaf on ways of expressing dramatic language through ges­ tures. Theatre productions with young hearing and deaf actors are also being organized. This European cooperation aims to create a European network of professional theatres for the deaf in Europe.

The growing success of the European initiative for a broad area of creativity and cooperation European City of Culture" was launched by the Council of Ministers in 1985, at the initiative of Melina Mercouri, Greek culture minister at the time. The aim was to help bring the peoples of Europe closer together. It was an immediate popular success. European Cities of Culture Every year the European Commission plays a very active role in supporting the European City of Culture event. The aim is to help draw attention to the cultural wealth and diversity of European cities by highlighting their common cultural heritage. Until 2004 it will remain an intergovernmental event, the cities being selected by the Council of Ministers. From 1985 to 1999 just one city was chosen to host the annu­ al event. However, owing to the many candidate cities and the particular symbolic value of a year marking the transition to the third millennium, nine European Cities of Culture have been selected for 2000: Avignon, Bergen, Bologna, Brussels, Cracow, Helsinki, Prague, Reykjavik and Santiago de Compostela. The European Cities of Culture have already been select­ ed through to 2004, after which a new selection proce­ dure will operate on a rotating basis between the Mem­ ber States until 2019 (see page 25 of the last issue of Le Magazine). The year 2000 programme: increasing awareness of the wealth of cultural heritage and the potential for cooperation. The Culture 2000 programme has just been adopted by the European Parliament and Council (see page 10). It will allow the Commission to provide funding for this year's nine designated cities. Their programmes are very varied and will allow thou­ sands of Europe's cultural organizations to work togeth­ er in fields as diverse as theatre, heritage, music, urban culture and the use of new technologies for artistic cre­ ation. The Internet site at europa.eu.¡nt/comm/culture/ index_en.html contains detailed information on the ac­ tivities planned. The principal themes of each of the nine Cities of Culture for the year 2000 are, briefly, as follows. The Brussels 2000 programme was inaugurated by the exhibition The House of Nine Cities at a ceremony at the European Parliament attended by European Commis­ sioner Viviane Reding. Nine artists from the nine Euro­ pean Cities of Culture presented works at the exhibition. The other artistic events planned for the year will all be based on the theme of The City, past and future. Avignon in France has also chosen to present reflections on the city as its central theme, but in the context of Transition. Transition from one city to another, from one millennium to another, between the city itself and its surroundings, between neighbourhoods and between in­ habitants. It will also present an exhibition entitled Beauty devoted to contemporary artistic expression and, during its famous theatre festival, will play host to pres­ tigious European theatre directors. Bergen (Norway) is organizing its activities in coopera­ tion with cultural institutions from other countries, with a specific programme for each Season. It will also be or­ ganizing a joint exhibition in association with a number of European maritime museums. Bologna (Italy) is putting the spotlight on the new com­ munication technologies in order to pay homage to its past at a time when it is looking to the future. A com­ mittee chaired by Umberto Eco is organizing the Net­ mage project to promote audiovisual production in net­ works. Cracow (Poland) will be holding a conference on the re­ lationship between Thought, Spirituality and Creativity. Special attention will be paid to the anniversary of the restoration of the University of Jagellons with a debate on teaching and knowledge in modern Poland. Helsinki (Finland) is staging a variety of events (street carnivals, concerts, post­modern opera) as part of an analysis of the relationships between Knowledge, Tech­ nology and the Future. To mark the 125 th anniversary of the birth of Jean Sibelius it is also holding a competition on the interpretation of his compositions. Prague (Czech Republic) is highlighting the theme of Cultural heritage and the growth of the city, with an ex­ hibition on architectural thought and the birth of mod­ ern town planning in Central Europe. Reykjavik (Iceland,) the capital of a country in which culture is closely linked to the forces of nature, is adopt­ ing links between Culture and Nature as its principal theme. It has commissioned a work for choir by the Es­ tonian composer Arvo Part. Santiago de Compostela (Spain), the destination of the famous pilgrimage across the length of Europe, is basing its programme on Exchanges between Europe and the rest of the world. Among the events will be an exhibition on the influence of land and ocean cartography in the context of major discoveries. ■ Further information Jean­Michel Courades, Education and Culture DG F+ 32 2 299 92 83 (33 , I t u 12 Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 
Further Information By the end of 2002, teachers should be equipped and skilled in the use of the Internet and multimedia resources. By the end of 2003, all pupils should be 'digitally literate' by the time they leave school. These are just some of the objectives of the eLearning initiative recently launched by European Commissioner Viviane Reding. eLearning: green light for Maruja Gutiérrez Díaz, Education and Culture DG F + 32 2 296 69 22 the digital age At the special European Council held in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March on "A Europe of Innovation and Knowledge", the European Union set itself a strategic objective for the coming decade: to become the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy, capable of sustained economic growth coupled with improved employment and greater social cohesion (seethe leading article in this issue of Le Magazine). The emergence of a knowledge­based economy should be a powerful factor for growth, competitiveness and job creation. To make the most of the opportunities, the Eu­ ropean Council in Feira (Portugal) on 20 June adopted a global eEurope action plan for the period 2000­2003. In this connection, the eLearning initiative launched by Viviane Reding, European Commissioner responsible for education and culture, aims to complete and render more concrete the education and training aspects of eEurope. The Commission is acting on two priority fronts in these fields. First, it is placing the emphasis on lifelong learn­ ing and the use of new technologies in the new genera­ tion (2000­2006) of European education, training and youth programmes. Subsequently, Europe must be quick­ er in adapting its education and training systems and in ensuring that all its training centres enter the digital age. Digital literacy should become a basic skill possessed by every citizen. Gaining momentum Following the launch of eEurope last December, in Janu­ ary 2000 the Commission adopted two reports: Design­ ing tomorrow's education. Promoting innovation with new technologies' and Strategies for jobs in the Infor­ mation Society 2 . These take stock of the present situation in Europe and propose ways of boosting the dynamic to create quality content and services in educational multi­ media, as well as to accelerate change in education and training systems and job creation. Adapting education and training to the digital age In this context, eLearning includes four main elements: ■ an effort to equip all learning centres with multimedia computers and to connect and improve access speeds to the Internet; ■ an effort to train teachers and trainers so that they can integrate these tools in their teaching practices; COM (2000) 23final COM (2000) 48final ■ the development of European educational multimedia resources offering high­quality content and services; ■ faster networking of education and training establish­ ments. For increased European cooperation Implementation requires increased cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, as well as the development of a concerted vision at European level in order to reflect on and prepare the education and train­ ing of the future. Although the resources will be largely national, an intervention by the European Structural Fund in eligible regions, the mobilization of Community programmes to promote information and communica­ tion technologies, and the development of public­pri­ vate partnerships will have a supporting role to play. The priority objectives of the eLearning initiative As Mme Reding reiterated at the press conference held to launch the initiative: "These objectives are particularly ambitious and require an additional effort on the part of most Member States. But if pursued and realized, they will allow Europeans to build the world's most dynamic knowledge society." The eLearning initiative aims to achieve the following objectives: ■ By the end of 2001 all schools should have access via the Internet to multimedia resources and support ser­ vices, including teaching resources and information. All young people must have access to the Internetand multimedia resources at public centres, especially in the most disadvantaged areas. All European countries should have high­speed and low­cost interconnected networks for Internet access; every country should have at least one university equipped with a campus network for multimedia communications. ■ Also by the end of 2001, there must be a trans­Euro­ pean high­speed network for scientific communica­ tions in electronic form which will link research insti­ tutes and universities, libraries and scientific centres, and ultimately schools; every European student should have access to the interactive multimedia courses of a virtual European campus involving at least one univer­ sity or open and distance learning centre or training service in each Member State. ■ By the end of 2002, all teachers should be individually equipped and able to use the Internet and multimedia resources. Pupils should have rapid access to the Inter­ net and multimedia resources in classrooms. ■ By the end of 2003, all pupils should have acquired a 'digital culture' by the time they leave school. Other initiatives with the same aim There are also plans under the EUN 3 (European School­ net) initiative to increase cooperation between 20 edu­ cation ministries in the European Union and EFTA coun­ tries and certain accession countries. Since the end of 1998, the EUN has made it possible for many schools to work together on European projects and to gain access to a large volume of information on educational net­ works in Europe. At the same time, there is a need for schools and train­ ing centres to progressively become local multidiscipli­ nary learning centres accessible to all, using the most ap­ propriate methods in the light of the diversity of the target groups. Finally, a broad communication plan will seek to popu­ larize the objectives of eLearning and mobilize all the ac­ tors in the field throughout Europe. ■ In 1999 there were 195 million Internet users, of which 46 million were in Europe compared to 107 million in the United States. This lag is exacer­ bated by the marked differences between socio­ economic categories and between the north and south of Europe. An average of 51% of Americans are on­line, compared to 23% of Europeans, with variations ranging from 49% in Finland to 6% in Greece. In 1998 Europe was short of 500,000 specialists in the new technologies. If the trend continues, this skills deficit is likely to exceed 1.6 million in 2002. In five years' time, 1 person in 2 will have a job which depends on the new technologies.

Netd@ys Europe continues to go from strength to strength, attracting more interest than in ever in 1999. Thousands of educational and cultural organizations are now involved in its activities, and new international links have extended access far beyond Europe's borders. Netd@ys Europe 2000 is set to be bigger than ever. The multimedia bridge between education and culture Netd@ys Europe aims to raise awareness in the educa­ tional and cultural communities of the potential value of using new online technologies as teaching, learning and discovery resources. These include the use of the Inter­ net, videoconferencing and new audiovisual tools. Netd@ys Europe is now the largest event of its kind in the world, attracting much interest and support from both the public and private sectors. It has grown in pop­ ularity each year since its launch in 1997: last year there were 5 million visits to its website, while 150,000 educa­ tional and cultural organizations in 35 countries partici­ pated. These included schools, youth clubs, museums, cinemas, opera houses and vocational training centres. The initiative includes a communication campaign that encourages partnerships between a variety of organiza­ tions in the private and public sectors. The website con­ tains detailed information about Netd@ys, its current activities and future plans. The Commission also provides financial support to some of the projects, which have to involve at least three partners from different European countries. Priority is given to the educational content of projects rather than to the technology. Two of the 1999 Netd@ys projects in particular proved to be extremely popular. The 'Guardians of the Millenni­ um' project was an online adventure about space. Over 35,000 students all over the world had access to infor­ mation about galaxies, the solar system, comets and oth­ er planets. The underlying theme was to develop a peace­ ful approach to outer space exploration and the resolution of territorial conflicts in space. Netd@ys Berlin was the largest of all the projects with 600 events organized. These included demonstrations of how the In­ ternet relates to youth training, employment opportuni­ ties and the development of foreign languages. These projects, and all the others involved in Netd@ys Europe 1999, participated in the Netd@ys Europe week which was held last year between 13 and 21 November. This provided the opportunity for all involved to showcase their projects and to exchange ideas and information about their interests in the areas of education and cul­ ture. It is possible to get involved in Netd@ys in a variety of ways. For example, last year there were touring buses equipped with PCs, PC­Cafés at schools, Open Doors Days, competitions, training courses, website inaugura­ tions, national and regional launch events, web maga­ zines and web pages, seminars, roundtables, discussions, events linking education and culture, e­mail exchanges, chats and games, press conferences and videoconfer­ ences. Many other activities are organized to promote the creation and exchange of educational online con­ tents all over the world. The participants do not only in­ clude European countries, since special links have been established with Canada, Australia, Japan, the USA and Israel. It is planned to extend these links to other coun­ tries in 2000. A number of private companies have demonstrated their commitment to Netd@ys by giving very generous finan­ cial and other support to the initiative. Their participa­ tion helps to ensure the success of the event and this is widely appreciated in the European Commission and elsewhere. Netd@ys Europe 2000: 20­27 November Netd@ys 2000 looks as if going to be even bigger. In 2000, the European Commission will continue its cam­ paign to: ■ help people to acquire the necessary skills to partici­ pate actively in the information society; ■ remove barriers to learning and ensure equality of ac­ cess for people of all ages and backgrounds, including those who live in disadvantaged or isolated areas and those with special needs; ■ strengthen and expand the links between education and culture; ■ encourage the participation of countries from outside Europe, especially central European countries, in what is now a global event. The European Netd@ys 2000 launch event will take place at the beginning of Netd@ys Week, 20­27 Novem­ ber, during the French EU Presidency, and will be jointly organized with the French Ministry of Education as part of the "Salon de l'Education" exhibition to be held in Paris. Who can participate? Netd@ys Europe is open to all organizations that want to raise awareness, and exchange their experiences of us­ ing new media as a tool for enhancing teaching and learning. Netd@ys also promotes partnerships between the public and private sectors in the fields of education, culture and vocational training. The Commission will be providing funding for some "um­ brella" projects and applications in this category had to be submitted by 3 May. However, participation is not lim­ ited to umbrella projects. "Labelled" Netd@ys projects can also participate. These are projects which are regis­ tered with the Commission as official Netd@ys 2000 projects and will receive various supporting materials such as flyers, posters and stickers. They will also be reg­ istered on the Netd@ys Europe website and this will give them wide publicity. Applications for "labelled" projects must be submitted before 20 November.

The Tempus trans­European cooperation programme for university studies was officially launched on 7 May 1990. Ten years old already! Over the years it has achieved a lot in concrete terms. But it has also evolved, opening up to the former communist bloc and reviewing its priorities. On the occasion of this tenth anniversary, Le Magazine takes a brief look at its achievements. Ten years of Tempus The birth of the programme for the Central and Eastern European countries In 1989 Poland and Hungary embarked on a policy of transition, opening up their borders and moving towards the market economy. Other Central and Eastern Euro­ pean countries soon followed. The European Community quickly established a pro­ gramme to support this process of economic and social change in these neighbouring countries (known as the Phare programme, standing for "Poland, Hungary, aid to economic restructuring"). Training was identified as one of the priority fields. It was particularly important to train a new generation of decision­makers, of individuals ready to take up the challenge of democratization and opening up to inter­ national economic and industrial competition. But many university courses were ill­adapted to the task. Whole areas of education needed to be revised, such as law and economics. With the difficult economic situation in these countries, their universities had very few resources with which to modernize. In order to support the drive to modernize the universi­ ty system, the European Commission drew on its experi­ ence with other Community programmes such as Eras­ mus and Comett and developed a customized programme aimed specifically at these Central and East­ ern European countries. On 7 May 1990, the Council of Ministers adopted Tempus, the "trans­European mobility programme for university studies". Tempus launches the exchanges In addition to offering financial support, the Communi­ ty allowed its new partners to choose the European mod­ el which they felt was best suited to them. The initiative for change therefore rested with the beneficiary institu­ tions so that the sum of the individual efforts would ul­ timately influence the university system as a whole. However, in order to ensure the necessary coherence be­ tween Tempus and overall national policies, the Commis­ sion and each of the partner countries decided to set a number of priority fields every year. It is in this way that, for the past 10 years, partnerships between universities in the East and West have initiated joint European projects to modernize or set up courses or study programmes, or to improve the way an institution in the beneficiary country is managed. In realizing these objectives each project can finance a number of activi­ ties. For example, university lecturers from the West can undertake teaching or advisory missions in the East, while lecturers from the East visit partner universities in the West and enrich their experience through contact with Community models. Students ­ mainly from the East­ can also spend part of the academic year studying at a partner university. Furthermore, the beneficiary in­ stitution can acquire the necessary equipment to ensure the project runs successfully. But Tempus has never viewed student exchanges as an end in themselves. The primary aim is to obtain ­ with a necessarily limited Community contribution ­ the best possible multiplier effect by acting on structures for the benefit of the students as a whole. Tempus extends to the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union and Mongolia A few years later, it was the countries now known as " the former Soviet Union" and Mongolia which embarked on political and economic reform. To assist this region, in 1993 the Community set up the "Tacis" programme, modelled on the Phare programme. This source of fi­ nancing, designed to assist these countries in their ef­ forts at economic recovery, allowed Tempus to extend its geographical range to these new partners. From assistance to cooperation... In the meantime, the Central and Eastern European countries, the first to have participated in Tempus, had been making enormous progress in terms of the content and organization of university courses and management. This favourable development made it possible to respond to the desire expressed by the heads of state and gov­ ernment in Copenhagen in June 1993 to see Community programmes open up to the associated countries of Cen­ tral and Eastern Europe. In addition to participation in Tempus II, the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci pro­ grammes progressively became accessible to them from 1997 onwards. For these countries this marked the posi­ tive transition from "assistance" to "cooperation". Also, to prepare their membership of the Community and facilitate the assimilation of the existing body of EU leg­ islation or acquis communautaire, Tempus set the new priority of "institution building", the aim of which is to put into place the structures to train the administrators, legislators and all the other socio­economic players in the period leading up to accession to the European Union. The future of Tempus The experience of these first 10 years provides a solid ba­ sis for the third phase of Tempus as agreed by the Coun­ cil in April 1999 for the period 2000­2006. This phase will be open to the non­associated Central and Eastern Euro­ pean countries as well as the countries of the former So­ viet Union and Mongolia. Tempus will continue its activities in Albania, Bosnia­ Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Mace­ donia. The other countries of the former Yugoslavia also want to participate in Tempus as soon as a political deci­ sion is made allowing them to benefit from Community assistance programmes. Tempus will therefore continue to provide substantial aid to reforming education sys­ tems in this region and will consolidate its impact on civ­ il structures and society. Taking stock From the Atlantic to the Bering Sea, in 10 years of activ­ ity Tempus has promoted fruitful and often friendly con­ tacts between over 1,900 higher education establish­ ments. Over 2,000 European projects in Central and Eastern Europe and 600 projects in the former Soviet Union and Mongolia have served to create 1,500 new courses and adapt 15,000 others. More than 120,000 teachers and 35,000 students, most of them from the East, have spent time at partner institutions. They have also acquired an enriching experience and established solid contacts with a part of Europe with which they were unfamiliar. It should also be stressed that 41 coun­ tries have pooled their efforts to make the programme a success. The various evaluations made of Tempus have also highlighted an unexpected benefit of the pro­ gramme: many Community teachers have acknowledged the fact that they improved their own courses after par­ ticipating in Tempus projects. Tempus faces a new challenge But the story goes on and Tempus still has much to do. Recent events have concentrated attention on the Balka­ ns. Meeting in Cologne in June 1999, the heads of state and government concluded a stability pact for south­ east Europe. This defines a framework for cooperation between the European Union, the Commission, the Unit­ ed States, Russia, Japan, the Balkans, Turkey, internation­ al organizations and all the countries seeking to partici­ pate. As the development of higher education is part of this cooperation, Tempus is naturally set to continue to play its part in stabilizing the region through regional, cultural and democratic cooperation. ■ Further information Christelle Leman, Education and Culture DG F+ 32 2 295 57 19 Le Magazine #13 · 2000 15 I n t t i 
Over the last two years, the Tempus programme has focused its activities in the EU candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe on giving universities a unique role in preparing for Union membership. Support for 'institution building' means reinforcing links between higher education institutions and the non-academic world of business, public services and government. Tempus helps Romanian universities to meet the EU challenge Tempus, the Trans-European mobility scheme for univer sity studies, was set up in 1990 to work with the Euro pean Union's Phare and Tacis programmes in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Its radical reorientation in recent years has focused on helping uni versities and colleges to train staff in public administra tion and industry to meet the challenges of EU member ship. The institution building projects offer academic bodies a central role in getting their countries ready to become part of the EU family, with the support of their counter parts in the existing Member States. They also bridge the gap between theory and practice - and this combination of academic knowledge and the world of work, whether in ministries, local authorities or private enterprises, has proved to be a winning one. Romanian project In Romania, the "Babes-Bolyai" University and the Tech nical University, both in the city of Cluj-Napoca, and Transylvania University of Brasov, have together launched a Joint European Project (JEP) to set up a net work for web-based continuous education in European studies. It involves the universities of Utrecht in the Netherlands, Limerick in Ireland, and Turin in Italy, plus a network of non-academic organizations including the Cluj Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, the Cluj County Council, the Foundation for the Promo tion of SMEs in Brasov, the Romanian wing of the Carpathian Euroregion Union and Swedish Telepedagog- ¡c Knowledge, based in Nyköping. The consortium plans to develop a continuous education network (CONED), and set up a CONED centre for web educational technology, as well as four learning labora tories in the two Cluj-Napoca universities. It is also de veloping four pilot courses in European studies support ed by Internet technologies. Finally it will set up a web library and database. Professors loan Salomie and Kalman Pusztai, from the Technical University of Cluj- Napoca, are the leading figures in the project. "We wanted to offer continuous education in European matters to employees from Romanian administration and industry," explains Professor Salomie, the project co ordinator. "The concept of institution building perfectly matches our goals. Web-based education is effective, cheap, and enables a large number of people to be edu cated without timetable constraints. The students can take the courses whenever they want, and progress at their own speed. There is no limitation on the number of students enrolled, and for course development and deliv ery, we can use the principle of 'develop once only - use it anywhere'. The new institution building projects are very important for developing the links between univer sities and their social and economic environment." No ivory tower Professor Pusztai, the project contractor, agrees. "A mod ern university is no longer an ivory tower, but must de velop contacts in the society that surrounds it," he ex plains. "The beneficiaries of our courses are people who usually have a university degree, but we can also offer special training to secondary school graduates from pub lic and local administrations, industry and social organi zations. The courses and practical applications we offer are based on careful analysis of the needs in different sectors, and we continuously adjust our courses to these needs. Given the nature of web-based education, with practically the same effort we can enrol several hundred participants at the same time." The Technical University of Cluj-Napoca - one of Roma nia's major higher education institutions- has taken part in no less than 22 Tempus projects over the past nine years. "Our participation has had a great impact on our institution, as well as on ourselves individually," says Pro fessor Pusztai. "Through these projects, we are in a posi tion to know directly the higher education systems in practically all EU countries. We are now able to respond to the needs of our regional enterprises and institutions, to whom we offer training in information technology." The "Babes-Bolyai" University also welcomes the collab oration with its sister institution. "Cooperation with the Technical University is very beneficial to us," explains Professor Maria Barsan, from the Faculty of European Studies. "In the humanities, we are not specialists in in formation technology, so our engineer colleagues help us to develop continuous education in European studies based on Internet technologies. With support from Tern- pus, our university has created and developed a Faculty of European Studies, which trains European economy and law specialists through four-year day courses. The faculty also offers M.Sc. and Ph.D. courses." Under the CONED project, "Babes-Bolyai" University has developed a new laboratory for web-based education, including a computer server, seven workstations and software for web-based course development. It will be used by target group members without their own Inter net connections. Staff have also acquired new expertise in web-based education and its delivery, and multimedia authoring tools, through attending training courses in EU partner universities. Identifying the need Before launching the project, the coordinators examined the training requirements of local enterprises and orga nizations. In Cluj, they liaised closely with the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture - one of the largest bodies of its kind in Romania and the major tar get-group partner. They found a demand for courses in European business law, European market and commercial policies, European management, quality standards in Eu rope, organizational behaviour, social policies, European communication policies and use of IT in organizations. Once they identified the main forms of training needed to promote European integration among target group members, the coordinators started to think about poten tial partners in Romania and the EU, specialized in Euro pean studies, economics and IT. "Our Western partners, from the Netherlands, Ireland and Italy, are outstanding universities with well-known achievements in European studies, open and distance learning and course development for multimedia," de clares Professor Salomie. "We are very pleased about our cooperation with these partners. We cooperate closely with them in training our staff in the new technology of web-based education and multimedia course authoring. They have also brought valuable input during project meetings." Pilot courses The project started in earnest in March 1999 when all the consortium partners met for the first time. For the par ticipants from Western universities, it was their first op portunity to meet the Romanian target groups. During the four-day meeting, the partners planned the curricu la and contents of the pilot courses, the time schedule for the courses, arrangements for recognition and ac creditation, and evaluation of the trainees. 'European Business Environment', 'European Management', 'Quality Management', and 'Information Systems in Organiza tions using Intranet/Extranet Technology', were the themes chosen for the pilot courses, all delivered and as sessed via the Internet. So far, the response from Romanian enterprises has been very positive. "Feedback from the two experimental cours es delivered in November and December 1999 for two of our target groups showed that the knowledge transferred was already applicable in their daily activities," says Pro fessor Salomie. "The participants also appreciated the very challenging new educational approach." "Our colleagues are very content with these courses," confirms Ion Giurgea, of the Cluj Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture. "The first experimental course delivered on the web for us and for nine members of the Chamber was attended by 96 students, and the number of people interested in taking them is increasing contin uously. "Our overall strategy is to facilitate business contacts, business and marketing information, foreign investment promotion and assistance, commercial arbitrage, com mercial advice, and training for companies. Thanks to this project we expect to be able to train our own employees, as well as those of member businesses, in European econ omy and management. We are aware of the importance of institution building for our development, so we take t I t I 16 Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 
these courses as a great opportunity for training people interested in European practices. We think web­based ed­ ucation is very modern, useful and effective." The European dimension "The idea of launching this JEP came from our clear per­ ception that Romanian society needs this input from the academic community, and we have the necessary skills and knowledge to provide it," adds Professor Pusztai. "What is particularly attractive for our target groups is the stress that Tempus projects put on the 'European di­ mension'. Romanians need to know, adopt and imple­ ment European legislation and regulations in their fields of activity. This is a part of our country's pre­accession strategy. "Through Tempus, and thanks to our Western partners' expertise and know­how, we offer our Romanian target groups the necessary knowledge of European institutions and legislation. The Tempus programme in general, and its institutional building component in particular, has proved to be a good framework for supporting the adop­ tion and implementation of the acquis communautaire by Romanian society." The training of trainers is an important part of the CONED project, and has two aspects. The selected train­ ers acquire the web­based education technology (remote student log­in, registration and communication, learning and evaluation) in the EU partner universities. The pro­ fessors, authors and tutors of pilot courses will make documentary studies in the Western partner institutions, aimed at developing new courses and practical applica­ tions. Becoming more visible The project is scheduled to end in March 2001. According to Professor Salomie, the experience acquired will enable the Romanian partnersto obtain extra funds from course fees. This money will be used for upgrading the labora­ tories, and to develop scientific research. "Everywhere in the world universities are struggling to get extra money," he explains. "Tempus projects are a good school for us, because we are learning from our Western partners how to become more visible, based on the quality of teaching, in the non­academic environment." For the Romanian partners, the only negative aspect of the whole CONED experience has been the amount of time "wasted" in obtaining travel visas from EU em­ bassies. "We hope this problem will be solved in the near future, at least for the people participating in the inter­ national projects, " says Professor Salomie. Apart from this inconvenience, the participants believe the project has helped them to make a significant con­ tribution towards the successful construction of an en­ larged Union. "Tempus institution building projects rep­ resent a good way to get the academics involved in the progress not only of their own universities, but of Ro­ manian society too, towards European integration," ar­ gues Professor Nicolae Paun, the Dean of the Faculty of European Studies. Indeed, all the CONED partners plan to maintain their cooperation within this framework after the Tempus project ends, and to make CONED a self­sustaining business. ■ Dan Grigorescu, Director National Tempus Office rue Constantin Noica, 140 RO­79782 Bucarest 6 T + 00 40 1 637 35 90 F+ 00 40 1 312 10 65 The launch of the European Union's Tempus programme in Romania, nine years ago, came just at the right time, says Director Dan Grigorescu. The country ­ and its academic institutions ­ were emerging from a period of massive political change. Teaching a whole new philosophy "The biggest challenge has been opening up the universi­ ty system towards the wider economic environment, not only for the sake of the universities themselves, but also to share skills with other sectors of society," explains Pro­ fessor Grigorescu, whose 10­year tenure as Tempus Direc­ tor ends in June 2001. "The link between universities and enterprises and organizations that is the main concern of Tempus institution building was an important priority for Romania, starting in the Tempus II phase (1995­1998) and continuing in the Tempus II bis (1998­2001). During these years more than 100 Centres for Continuing Education were created in most of our public universities. All these centres work with specific target groups." Another major priority was the 'Europeanization' of the system, bringing university courses and curricula more into line with the EU Member States. "They are very much compatible now, in all fields," he says. In the tech­ nical universities, this meant introducing new technolo­ gy, and teaching the norms applied to European indus­ tries. In the higher education institutions centred on economics, political sciences, law and in general on hu­ manities, the courses underwent an even more funda­ mental overhaul, as the basic concepts and the entire philosophy imposed on universities by the old Commu­ nist system were overturned, and they opened up to the new interpretations on which democratic societies and market­oriented economies are based. Foreign language teaching has also been extended dra­ matically, with even technical students undertaking at least two years of language study. At the same time, ex­ plains Professor Grigorescu, the universities have re­ formed their administrative structures, setting up new facilities such as student counselling and career advice, and introducing the European Credit Transfer System. Learning through dialogue Professor Grigorescu regards the Tempus initiative as "very generous and very appropriate". "Without it, the universities in all the Phare countries would not have achieved what they have over the last 10 years," he ar­ gues. It represented a new approach to developing cours­ es, not on the basis of the skills of one particular profes­ sor, but bringing together the know­how of different academics in institutions inside and outside the EU. "Pro­ fessors from our partner universities in the West have told us how much they have learnt themselves through this dialogue," he adds. In November 1998, the National Tempus Office orga­ nized an international conference in Brasov on "Univer­ sities in their social and economic environment". Roman­ ian professors and managers of different types of enterprises, together with their projects partners from France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Greece and Fin­ land, spoke about their achievements and experiences, and some of the obstacles they faced in developing co­ operation. Mutually beneficial It was through the support of Tempus, some years ago, that the "Babes­Bolyai" University in Cluj­Napoca was able to set up a new faculty of European Studies. Under the CONED project, the information technology skills of the Technical University helped to extend this work out­ side the university walls, to the non­academic partners in the town of Cluj­Napoca. Now, other faculties are devel­ oping continuing education courses, which will also ben­ efit enterprises, while at the same time bringing re­ sources into the university. Professor Grigorescu admits that money is short in Ro­ mania's 49 public universities. "But this is the same for all universities in the world," he insists. "I have discussed this with colleagues from France and Germany. The funds they receive from government are never enough. But it is true that our needs are not comparable. We lack the money to provide the minimal requirements for a mod­ ern education: well equipped laboratories and libraries, and decent conditions for our students in hostels and other facilities. There are always protests in our country about the small education budget." Although no charge is made for courses during the life of the Tempus project, when it finishes it isin everyone's in­ terest to maintain the structure that has been estab­ lished, and at this point the universities can look forward to earning some extra funding. Romania also has almost 58 private universities, but these are still going through the process of course accreditation, and were not eligible for the Tempus programme. Some 124,000 students at­ tend private universities in this academic year (1999/2000), compared with 318,649 in the public sector. In all, over 600 Romanian enterprises and other organi­ zations have participated or are still participating as Tempus project partners. "From the official European Commission statistics, it seems this is the largest partici­ pation of non­academic sectors in Tempus projects in all Phare countries," says Professor Grigorescu. Since 1991, he has seen the role of Romania's universities transformed. "Through the diversification of fields, they are now relating to a new type of society, to a democra­ tic, market economy," he explains. "They are sustained by their autonomy, by their cooperation, and by their new connections with the wider environment." ■ Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 17 I n t t ι t ι 
p ' ι ι κ , ^ ¡ ä v '. 11 V W' Γινο programmes launched with the USA and Canada in 1996 are starting to make a notable contribution to transatlantic friendship. Students, teachers and administrators have benefited from virtual and real mobility. The schemes have a wide geographical range and have drawn in 'associated partners' from private Industry and regional authorities. Sharing insights across the Atlantic At the end of 1995 the European Parliament and the Council gave a green light to two modest­sized pro­ grammes of academic cooperation with the US and Canada. The basic formula involves a minimum of three institutions in three EU Member States joining with three partner institutions in different US States of the Union or, in the case of Canada, in different Provinces, to cooperate in a new and innovative teaching or learn­ ing project, financed for a three­year period only. Each project is supposed to show evidence of sustainability on its own after public seed­funding has ended. Each partner may send abroad a small number of ex­ change students during the life of the project. Usually, the students spend part of the first year undergoing cultural and linguistic preparation, and travel during the second and third year. Both the partner services, the US Department of Education and Human Resources Development Canada, agreed with the Commission in insisting that the success of the programmes depended on the degree to which the students were prepared to integrate socially with the surrounding community, as well as fitting into the study course. The transfer of study credits is an integral component of the programmes. On the European side, this could well have proved extremely difficult for the visitors had it not been for the valuable experience already gained in the European Credit Transfer System ­ ECTS. But the real success of the programmes lies in many of the intangible activities undertaken, such as the devel­ opment of new teaching curricula in academically­ advancing or multidisciplinary areas, or in the design of new teaching materials and media. According to an external evaluation', an additional benefit was in the area of "virtual" mobility. It is esti­ mated that in each institution about 60 students par­ ' the Evaluation of the Cooperation Programme in Higher Education and training between the European Community and the United States/Canada, The Circa Group Europe Ltd, 1999. ticipated in some forms of transatlantic virtual mobili­ ty using the web and e­mail. Although such benefits were hoped for when setting up the programmes ini­ tially, the joint consortium formula has proved particu­ larly successful in catalysing subject matter for inter­ change among the partner institutions' students. This may provide a useful lesson on how to maximize the benefits of multilateral forums of academic coopera­ tion with other non­Community partners and regional grouping in times of budgetary stringency. Education and training In designing the programmes, Canadian, American and European partners attempted to build on the various experiences of such cooperation each had gained over the years. On the European side, this included experi­ ence with the Comett programme, which encouraged universities ­ writ large to include technological train­ ing institutions ­ to cooperate with industry in teach­ ing and learning about new technological innovations. Such education and training is regarded as the most successful means of diffusing innovation. Thus, in ad­ dition to the minimum of three partners on each side, so­called associated partners could be included, such as private enterprises, professional associations and re­ gional development authorities. In one case, a number of European and American motor manufacturers have joined as associated partners in an engineering project. Regional spread Another potential benefit of the multi­partner struc­ ture is that it allows regional participants with no pre­ vious experience of such international cooperation to short­circuit the lengthy setting­up time, not to men­ tion the expense, involved in such partnerships. Fre­ quently the lead partner has such experience and in­ vites inexperienced new partners to join in, thus enhancing the cost­effectiveness of the model. Not only are all EU countries relatively well represented but the programmes now include partners in some 47 States of the Union and in all Canadian Provinces, as well as in the Yukon and Northwest Territory. Multidisciplinary To date some 45 Joint EC/US Consortia and 35 Joint EC/Canada Consortia have been selected for support following a rigorous system of independent assessment by outside experts, who follow the guidelines for pro­ ject selection laid down by the Council in 1995. Unfor­ tunately, due to the shortage of funding, slightly less than 20 % of proposals are successful (annual budget of €600,000 p.a. for Canada, and €1,200,000 p.a. for USA fora total of 12 US projects and 6 Canadian projects per year). A full listing of projects to date is available for consul­ tation on the Europa server 2 . These include such diverse areas of study as mathematics, engineering, agricultur­ al biotechnology, aerospace, nursing, coastal develop­ ment, training for old age, forestry, child abuse and pro­ tection, curricula for deaf persons, and teledetection from space. More than 200 American, 150 Canadian and 300 European institutions are involved. In addition to the physical and virtual mobility of students, about 500 teachers and administrators have crossed the At­ lantic between US and EC, and 350 between Canada and EC, to share their diverse experiences, help remove barriers to mobility and encourage an innovative form of structural, long­term cooperation on a wide range of challenging topics. ■ ' http://europa.cu.int/comm/education/index_en.html Further information Brendan Cardiff, Education and Culture DG F+32 2 295 57 19 http://europa.eu.int/comm/education/index_en.html 18 Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 
More than 2,000 people took part in the special event to launch phase two of the Leonardo da Vinci programme, In Brussels in January. They were able to find answers to their questions about European Commission support for vocational training projects under the new scheme, which runs for the next seven years. Record turnout in Brussels for the Leonardo da Vinci Contact and Information Days Knowledge is a vital "raw material" in a rapidly changing world. This was one of the key points emphasised by Ed­ ucation and Culture Commissioner Viviane Reding, when she opened the Leonardo da Vinci Contact and Informa­ tion Days held in Brussels at the end of January. Attract­ ing a record number of more than 2,000 participants, the event signalled the launch of the second phase of the European Community's vocational training programme. Over the next seven years, a quarter of a million (mainly young) people should benefit from training actions with a European dimension under the expanded Leonardo da Vinci scheme. "Training," Mrs Reding pointed out at the opening ses­ sion, "has become a central tool in helping individuals to meet the new requirements of the economy and the labour market." She underlined the need to reconcile economic growth and social cohesion by ensuring that all individuals had access to knowledge irrespective of their age, qualifications or social background. The high level of interest in the Leonardo da Vinci programme was reflected in speeches at the inaugural session by repre­ sentatives of the Council of Ministers (Portuguese presi­ dency), the European Parliament, the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UNICE). Two focal points The Contact and Information Days had two main focal points: a series of workshops offering the opportunity to obtain details about specific measures under the new phase of Leonardo da Vinci; and an exhibition area with more than 40 stands and meeting points staffed by the Commission and the National Agencies. The workshops, directed by Commission officials, with participation from national experts, concentrated on the five types of measure which qualify for Community sup­ port under the programme: ■ mobility, ■ pilot projects, ■ language competencies, ■ transnational networks, ■ reference material. Sessions were also organized on "Dissemination and cap­ italizing on results" and the recently introduced « Eu­ ropass Training » scheme. The workshops proved so pop­ ular that extra ones had to be organised on the afternoon of the second day. At the stands, project promoters were able to seek out partners and discuss possibilities for new vocational training actions. Staff from the national agencies of most of the 31 countries taking part in the Leonardo da Vinci programme were kept busy, as were the officials on duty at the main Commission stand in the centre of the hall. Promoters in search of partners were able to leave messages at one of the six "thematic meeting areas" where more specialist advice was also available from the Commission. The whiteboards located in these zones rapidly changed hue as hundreds of colour­coded mes­ sages were posted. There was also a special zone equipped with computer monitors for those looking for potential partners already registered on the database. At a nearby stand, technical advice was available on how to set up a project and on the 2000­2002 call for proposals. Finally, there was an extensive documentation area dis­ playing the new guides to promoters and application forms. ■ Helping adults on to the education ladder John Kennedy is all too aware of the dangers of so­ cial exclusion in a global economy increasingly in­ fluenced by hi­tech developments. As an adult ed­ ucation officer in Kerry, Ireland, his work includes helping people to acquire the core learning skills that are essential if they are to avoid being margin­ alized. County Kerry (population 120,000), in the rural south­west of Ireland, has 6,000 students on adult education courses. These are mainly in part­ time and evening classes, but the figure includes some 200 unemployed people involved in full­time training. Le Magazine spoke to John in January at the Con­ tact and Information Days in Brussels. He was there to investigate the possibility of setting up a dissem­ ination project in the field of adult basic training, following on from an existing pilot project which was supported under the first phase of the Leonar­ do da Vinci programme. "There is a need," he said, "to have some form of certification for adults at the basic level which is recognized." Working closely with partners in France, Finland and the UK, the local education au­ thority in Kerry has developed an agreed descrip­ tion of skills ("adult education outcomes") which they hope will gain wider international acceptance. Having been validated at local level and by the pro­ ject committee, .the aim is to have it accepted by national education agencies. John is also now hop­ ing to attract interest from other countries, notably in Eastern Europe. He was keen to stress how the approach developed in the four­country pilot pro­ ject ­ with its focus on transparency of qualifica­ tions and the need to integrate marginalized groups in society ­ fitted in with the general thrust of adult education in Europe. Like other possible project promoters, John Kennedy saw the "Days" as an important opportu­ nity to make new contacts and learn first­hand about the priorities and procedures of the pro­ gramme's latest phase.

Disabled graduates are four times more likely to be unemployed than their able­bodied peers and two out of three are still jobless six months after graduating. Through a unique deal with universities, NGOs, government departments and key companies, United Kingdom charity Workable helps hundreds of disabled students each year to secure work placement experience and job offers with top employers. Now, following a Leonardo da Vinci pilot project, the organization is ready to transfer this model across Europe. Promoting equality for disabled students - on a shoestring UK charity Workable, which provides counselling, train­ ing, work experience and employment opportunities for disabled students, began life 10 years ago as a partner­ ship helping key UK disability charities to work together more closely. Many of the charities from those early days ­ Action for Blind People, Barnardo's, Mencap, the Royal National Institute for the Blind ­ are still trustees, now joined by private sector companies such as Tate Et Lyle, Pearl Assurance PLC and the Prudential. Le Magazine met staff at their offices just outside the City of London to find out more. Currently, around 100 of the UK's biggest employers sup­ port Workable ­ by sponsorship, hosting awareness days for disabled students, or by backing one of the organiza­ tion's specialist projects focusing on the legal profession, the arts, government, insurance or the media. Vanessa Davis, Workable's new chief executive, explains: "Research, and our own experience, suggests that dis­ abled people are four times more likely to be unem­ ployed. Disabled graduates are no exception ­ two out of three are still unemployed six months after graduating." Workable's early pioneers saw a clear need for services to improve this situation, and the charity was born. Low expectations It aims to provide counselling, advice and guidance for disabled students "at what is often a crucial time in their lives," says director David Bennett. "Many students come to us convinced that the world of work simply doesn't want them, with their self­esteem and expectations in­ credibly low. Sometimes the first thing ­ often the most important thing ­ we have to do is change attitudes." Changing attitudes ­ of employers and of disabled stu­ dents themselves ­ is a fundamental part of the organi­ zation's work. Paulette Thomas, office manager and the first point of contact for students approaching the orga­ nization, adds, "We never turn people away because their disability is too severe. Attitude is more important than disability. It may sometimes take a long time,12 months or more, but we usually find most students a sponsored placement in the career of their choice. But I always say: you have to really want to do this." The organization operates on a shoestring, with no core funding or income from statutory bodies and only 10 full­time staff. Yet Workable now has an office in Lon­ don, five regional centres ­ all managed by disabled graduates or industry secondées ­ five specialist pro­ grammes targeting particular professions and an emerg­ ing European network of 'Workable centres'. Of necessi­ ty, it has become skilled in securing private sector sponsorship and other charitable funding. David Ben­ nett, for example, was busy liaising with Shazia Khan, the young woman coordinating his forthcoming 650­mile sponsored 'Premiership Walk', visiting 20 Premier League football grounds throughout April and May to raise money for Workable. This kind of can­do energy and commitment seems to permeate the organization. Pilot project From 1995 to 1998, with funding from the Leonardo da Vinci programme ­ designed to increase transnational mobility, exchanges and placements for young people ­ Workable ran a three­year pilot project to test the po­ tential for extending the idea to other Member States. "We know we have a transferable model which others can use and learn from," says Jennie Hawks, who man­ aged the project, "but we needed to test it. We needed to find out whether conditions for disabled students were the same elsewhere (they aren't necessarily), and we needed to identify what kind of infrastructure needs to be in place before a fully­fledged programme of interna­ tional placements for disabled students can take place." This pilot project resulted in the establishment of a num­ ber of firm partnerships with transnational universities, NGOs and companies in the Netherlands, Germany, Aus­ tria, Italy and Greece. "Some of these partners," explains Hawks, "are large organizations with a ready infrastruc­ ture for placements and training. But others were orga­ nizations completely new to this field and the work in­ volved is very much greater." This emerging European network has begun to establish the shared infrastructure necessary to underpin transna­ tional placements. Demand from students for such placements is increasing, says Workable, although the practical language difficulties have yet to be fully ex­ plored. "If a person's first language is 'signing', for exam­ ple," says Hawks, "can they be supported to use a foreign language? No one really knows and here, as with many aspects of disability, there is a huge need for primary re­ search which the European Commission should perhaps be investigating." The project culminated in the publication of a successful guidebook to help potential partners set up their own Workable centres, plus 'Job Search Skills' resource packs for use in each centre. Over 80 placements were gener­ ated ­ in Austria, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, the UK and Italy ­ and 20 students have since been offered jobs. European network The organization believes that the pilot has shown there is a real need for a European network, and it is commit­ ted to ensuring that European placements will in future be a core activity. Further partnerships are being devel­ oped in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, and # 20 Le Magazine ■ #13 ■ 2000

The pilot also revealed some of the obstacles that need to be overcome if an effective European Workable network is to be established. "Corporate culture isn't the same right across Europe," explains Jennie Hawks. "The UK has an increasingly US­influenced corporate culture and the kind of Employment Action Days we encourage our cor­ porate partners to host ­ where students can learn about CV writing, interview skills and other things which will prepare them for the jobs market ­ work well. But in southern Europe, employers seem more reluctant to take on this kind of role and students tend not to expect them to." Private sector partners in Italy and the Netherlands were amongst the first to drop out of the scheme, in one case handing involvement over to a university. "Certainly, it is harder to work with SMEs as partners ­ universities are far more used to this kind of role," Hawks concedes. In 1999, with funding from the UK's National Lottery Charities Board, the organization set up Artsable, an­ other specialist project aimed at giving disabled stu­ dents access to work experience in the arts and cultural industries. Le Magazine spoke to 28­year­old Emma Beamont who manages the project. Emma, who is par­ tially sighted, first approached Workable for advice and counselling while studying at the Royal College of Mu­ sic. "I had begun to feel that I hadn't the right tempera­ ment to make it as a professional singer, which is what I had been studying for," she explains. "I really wanted to try and combine an interest in the arts with the under­ standing my personal experience of disability has given me, to do something valuable and satisfying. But I had­ n't a clue how to do that. Workable gave me the best ad­ vice I could have hoped for and pointed me towards some information technology training, as I had no com­ puter skills." However, Emma's sight continued to deteriorate and she decided to abandon her studies. "I was sitting at home wondering what on earth I was going to do," she says. It was then that Workable contacted her and suggested she apply for the post of manager of the new Artsable pro­ ject. "I did, I was successful and I haven't looked back since," she says. "I love it." Within months, Emma was presenting a keynote speech to a conference on sight impairment in Finland and preparing the national launch of Artsable. "It was an in­ credibly steep learning curve for me," she says. "As well as delegates from some of the biggest arts organizations in the UK, we had two government ministers and the chairperson of the National Lottery Charities Board." Opportunities in the arts The organization believes that the arts offer massive op­ portunities for students with disabilities, and has already secured over 20 placements at companies as diverse as the international fashion magazine Vogue, Covent Gar­ den Opera, the Tate Gallery, The Arts Council, the Royal College of Music, the National Theatre and numerous smaller theatre companies. "We can offer placements throughout the year, during vacations, as part of sand­ wich courses or as fixed­term graduate contracts," Emma explains. "The arts world can be far more flexible than some parts of the private sector. However, we do find it hard to find sponsored placements in the arts. Students may well find the placement of a lifetime, but they won't necessarily be earning." Workable is striving to reach "the kind of 'critical mass' which ensures that employers come to us rather than the other way round," says Vanessa Davis. There is some evi­ dence that this is beginning to happen. A number of arts­related employers now send Workable their vacancy and placement details as a matter of course, over 50 gov­ ernment departments participate in the Workable in the Civil Service scheme, and almost 20 of the UK's top law firms participate in Legable, the specialist project fo­ cused on the legal profession. "We're sure this is the way forward ­ it's one way we can really focus our resources on particular sectors." Mentoring scheme With funding of £54,000 from the Lloyds­TSB Founda­ tion, the organization has embarked on a mentoring scheme, aimed at pairing disabled students with mentors in a range of professions, in a further bid to ensure that students maximize the benefits of their placement peri­ ods. Workable believes that work experience, often the key thing missing from disabled students' CVs, brings bene­ fits both for students and employers. "There can be a big gap between disability policy and practice," says Davis, "and a successful placement experience can change this." She cites the example of Reading Univer­ sity student Simon Killingray, a wheelchair­user, who spent his vacation constructing an integrated database at the RAF Hercules Support Authority facility at RAF Wyton. Simon has since written, "I was pleased to be given a 'proper' job and not something created for a student, but there were other, more subtle benefits too. Although my colleagues had equal opportunities train­ ing, they found learning about the day­to­day difficul­ ties encountered by someone with a disability highly rewarding." The charity works closely with universities' careers and welfare officers, but students are also encouraged to ap­ ply by e­mail via the Workable website. "We advise man­ agers to maintain a caseload of no more than 50 stu­ dents each," says Davis, "which means we can realistically support a maximum of 350 students a year." Since its in­ ception, Workable has supported over 600 students and estimates that around 50% of these went on to careers in the professions of their choice. "Currently we estimate that about 75% of students gain employment after us­ ing our services," says Jennie Hawks, "but our resources are too limited to enable us to stay in touch with gradu­ ates much beyond six months or so." One of the things the organization would like to do is set up an alumni as­ sociation so that past and current clients can be brought together. "That could be a really powerful example, espe­ cially for students who currently don't feel very much hope regarding their careers." It is after 17h00 on Friday afternoon but most desks at Workable are still occupied. « We know we're just touch­ ing the tip of the iceberg and that there are at least 60,000 disabled students in the UK alone », says David Bennett. "There's always more to do." ■ Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 21 \ *" 
Vocational training The changing scene in Europe There is a strong emphasis in these articles on the re form of continuing vocational training, particularly with a view to combating skill shortages and to meeting the specific needs of adults, who have missed out in initial education and training, and of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it is hoped to achieve the necessary flexibility to meet these needs by establishing networks and learning re source centres funded through private limited compa nies set up specifically for this purpose. In Finland and the Netherlands there is an emphasis respectively on long-term planning and on involving all relevant part ners. In Norway paid educational leave is seen as a po tential instrument for achieving greater adult participa tion. The item on Germany is concerned with ensuring the availability of training places for all young people, while the one on Denmark deals with the reform and ex tension of short vocationally-oriented higher education programmes The articles have been selected from contributions by members of Cedefop's documentary information net work.

Michael Adams F + 32 2 230 58 24 jma@cedefop.eu.int Denmark - Reform of vocationally oriented higher education The reform of short higher education programmes has been on its way for quite some time. From August 2000, the number of these will be reduced to 15. Of these 13 are entirely new. The aim of reducing their number, from about 75, is first and foremost to ensure broader and more focussed programmes that can compete with oth er further and higher education provision. Secondly, the new programmes are to provide students with skills that prepare them for future labour market needs. Thirdly, the aim is to make the area more transparent and intelligible to students. Finally, the reform is an important part of the overall government objective according to which 50% of each cohort completes a further education pro gramme. The duration of the programmes, except for construc tion, will be two years and they will aim at qualifying students for middle management positions in private and public enterprises. Students who have completed a relevant vocational education and training programme or upper general secondary education will have access to most of the new programmes. Another important element of the reform is to ensure the general quality and the nation-wide homogeneity of each programme. A programme e.g. in the field of IT and communication should provide students with the same skills regardless of where in Denmark they have complet ed it. In order to ensure quality and homogeneity, the Ministry of Education has formulated a number of qual ity criteria covering both institutions and programmes. These criteria also aim at a continuous development of the programmes.

It sets a frame work of both quantitative and qualitative objectives, which will be implemented by annual decisions concern ing curricula, the number of places and courses, and re source allocation. Progress towards the achievement of the objectives will be monitored and evaluated annually. The aim is to target vocational training at those areas that are threatened by skill shortages. In 2004, there will be 49,000 upper secondary places, some of which will be provided in the form of apprenticeship. At least 42,000 people should obtain vocational qualifications at this level in 2004, when the cohort of 18-year-olds will be just over 60,000. The degree level provision of polytechnics will be ex panded and re-targeted at fields within areas like con servation, culture, arts, craft and design. In 2004, 25,000 entry places will be available, while 19,000 polytechnic degrees will be completed and 80% of polytechnic stu dents should finish their degrees within the standard time. To support the reform of current on-the-job training, dissemination of relevant information, training for on- the-job instructors, teacher training and pilot projects will be developed in cooperation with the social partners. Arrangements for financially supporting the adult popu lation during periods of study will be developed once the working group set up by the Prime Minister's Office has presented its proposals. The use of study vouchers, as a form of financing adult education and training will be investigated through experimentation.

This means that in 2000 the Federal Employment Agency will again have around €2 billion to fund new and existing measures. The guidelines have changed in some areas. For instance, in addition to training, the focus will be on facilitating access to the jobs market through labour cost subsidies. It is intended to place young people without training in initial vocational training rather than in continuing training or a job creation scheme. The training programme for unplaced apprentices will be cancelled in favour of an earlier start in out-of-compa- ny initial training. Job creation schemes will be used only when it appears that young people's integration into working life cannot be achieved through training or oth er placement assistance. The measures take account of two criticisms of the exist ing programme. As the proportion of foreigners among those receiving assistance was low, minimum participa tion rates, which reflect their proportion of the young unemployed and of those seeking a training place, will be introduced. To meet a criticism, voiced particularly by employer organizations, that a high proportion of those being assisted already possess an upper secondary or in termediate school leaving certificate, young people with an upper secondary school leaving certificate can in fu ture be trained outside companies only in cases of hard ship. Out-of-company training will be concentrated on regions with particular problems.

The three year programme, with a budget of €16.125m, is funded by the Department of En­ terprise, Trade and Employment and the Euro­ pean Social Fund. The board of the company (Skillnets) set up to manage the programme is comprised of six business representatives, three employee representatives and three government nominees. The programme is focused on improving the lev­ el and quality of training and development ac­ tivities in enterprises, which already invest in training. It also aims to increase the amount of training in enterprises (particularly SMEs) and sectors where little training has taken place to date. Networks can be created to fulfil sectoral, regional or specific types of training needs. The focus is on mobilizing groups of companies to develop strategic answers to their joint training needs and on tapping into the reservoir of best practice. The self­directing nature of the net­ works allows companies to determine the aims of each network and the way it should operate, and to ensure it is of direct relevance to their business needs. By pooling resources and by group­purchasing so­ lutions to common training problems, the cost of access­ ing training can be reduced for individual companies, a factor of importance for SMEs.

It contained his view on what should happen in the coming years if the sector isto ful­ fil its tasks. The agenda is meant to be the starting point for a process in which all parties involved in vocational training and adult education will contribute towards a policy for further development. The minister does not want to impose his views. Parties involved include the as­ sociations for regional colleges and for national voca­ tional education bodies, the social partners, municipali­ ties and other ministries. The agenda underlines the immense importance of voca­ tional training and adult education for the individual, the labour market and society as a whole. The 1996 Act on Vocational Training and Adult Education (WEB) and the establishment of the regional education and training centres created the right framework. Two leading princi­ ples for future action have now been identified: ■ reinforcement of quality, accessibility and regional co­ operation ■ promotion of institutional autonomy and deregula­ tion. Important themes for the coming years include: lifelong learning, development of qualification structures, rein­ forcement of the teaching and training process, ensuring the quality of teaching staff and their legal and financial status, quality assurance and public accountability. Most of these relate to policy documents, published in previ­ ous years, which the minister wants to put into a more coherent framework.

The arrangement is valid for all employees who have been working for at least three years and with the same employer for at least two years. Training above basic and upper secondary educa­ tion level must be work­related and part of a recognized education and training provision. Financial support will be provided through the State Educational Loan Fund. Based on an agreement between the government and the social partners made during April 1999 wage negoti­ ations, a total of around €45 million, will be allocated for development projects over a 2 to 3 year period, start­ ing with some €5.5 m in 2000. The money will be spent on joint actions between training providers and employ­ ers, with the aim of developing the market for continu­ ing education and training.

De­ veloped under the government's University for Industry (Ufi) initiative, these are being run as a pilot scheme. Up to a thousand centres will be opened by autumn 2000, when 'learndirect' will be fully operational. Ufi is not a university or ed­ ucational establishment in the conventional sense. It is a public­private partnership whose strategic aims are to stimulate demand for life­ long learning and to improve access to relevant high­quality learning. In particular it will use in­ formation and communication technologies to achieve its objectives. It will work with business­ es and education and training providers to make learning available at times, places and formats to suit learners. Ufi Ltd. is a private limited company appointed by the government to carry forward the Ufi initiative. The gov­ ernment will provide €70.4 million during the first year (1999­2000). Ufi Ltd will be independent, though the government remains the major stakeholder. In its devel­ opment plan Ufi identified four priority target groups: ■ adults with low basic skills ■ employees in small enterprises ■ employees in the retail, automotive component, envi­ ronmental and multimedia sectors ■ industries and businesses which need to improve their information technology skills. Ufi has a target of providing information to 2.5 million people a year by 2002 and creating demand for one mil­ lion courses and learning packages by 2004. It will cater for a wide range of levels, from basic skills to postgradu­ ate learning and from general management to specific technical skills. Learning needs will be met by the 'learndirect' network and by existing suppliers. Scottish Ufi, a parallel but distinct initiative, is to be launched in autumn 2000. It has been allocated €26 mil­ lion by the devolved Scottish parliament and has at­ tracted €6.5 m through an Adapt project.

The European jobs market requires a skilled and flexible workforce if the EU is to compete successfully with its global competitors. Lifelong learning is one of the keys to updating knowledge and maximizing potential. But vocational training and educational systems must be adapted within the framework of a common European strategy. An age of learning without time limits Making lifelong learning a reality requires a fundamen­ tal rethink of the role of vocational training, according to An Age of Learning, a report' prepared and published by the European Centre for the Development of Voca­ tional Training (Cedefop) which analyses vocational training policy developments at European level over the past 40 years. It looks at action in the Member States and the impact of economic and social change on vo­ cational training, and concludes that there is a need for a more clearly focused policy framework at European level. A context of change Successive European policy frameworks have identified common issues, acted as a reference point for national vocational training policies and provided the context for practical cooperation, such as pilot projects and ex­ changes. But the pace of economic and social change has quick­ ened. European producers need a well­trained work­ force. Jobs for unskilled workers have declined and those requiring a capacity for reasoning and manage­ ment as well as technical know­how have increased. Change has put a premium on a high level of education, which is having ever more influence on career prospects. And it poses serious challenges for vocation­ al training systems. Towards lifelong learning Throughout the EU, efforts have been made to raise skill levels. Member States have sought to reduce the num­ bers of young people leaving school without qualifica­ tions and to give those who do. leave sufficient voca­ tional training'to find a job. They have also agreed that people need accessio learn­ ing throughout their working lives. But making lifelong learning a reality has far­reaching implications. It blurs traditional distinctions between initial and continuing vocational training, between formal and non­formal learning and between general education and vocation­ al training. Establishing a system of lifelong learning requires a fundamental re­examination of the role of vocational training, what it comprises, what is expect­ ed of it, how it is delivered, how it is financed and how to offer the widest possible access to it. How systems change will be determined by the interac­ tion of a wide range of interests, including government at various levels, the social partnersand individuals. This ' An Age of Learning: vocational training policy at European level, Cedefop. Luxembourg EUR­OP, 2000, 148pp, ISBN 92­828­8051­6, HX­25­99­075­EN­C. Price _ 19. The report is available in English, French, German and Portuguese. It can be ordered from Cedefop or through www.trainingvillage.gr/etv/pollcyreport, from which an ex­ ecutive summary in the 11 official EU languages can be downloaded free of charge implies a need for consensus building. For systems to change effectively all those involved need to under­ stand the strategy and objectives being pursued. A European framework Irrespective of differences in vocational training sys­ tems, the challenge of responding to change is common to all Member States. But facing common challenges is not new in this area. In the past, they have been met by pooling ideas, iden­ tifying common objectives and agreeing joint action. Accordingly, the EU has been seen as a reference point for developing national policies and areas of coopera­ tion. The joint opinions of the social partners have also been a reference point at EU level for both sides of in­ dustry in developing their approaches to vocational training. There is a need for a clearly focused policy framework at European level to act as a reference point to support Member States' efforts to reform their systems. Such a framework could identify common policy issues and de­ fine the links between vocational training and the Eu­ ropean employment strategy. It could encourage debate on ways of making lifelong learning a reality and help build consensus across the EU on the objectives of vo­ cational training and the measures for achieving them. It would also help establish an effective system for the exchange of information and experience at European level, providing a forum for discussion and analysis and helping to improve policy­making. A strong political commitment is essential to implement such a policy framework at European level, with clear roles for the Education Committee, the Social Affairs Council, the European Parliament and other European institutions and bodies. Many elements of a framework already exist. Policy­ makers meet regularly at European level. A number of organizations, including Cedefop, collect information on vocational training developments. The results of the European vocational training programmes, such as the first phase of Leonardo da Vinci, are sources of new ma­ terial to feed into the debate. The challenge is to draw these elements into a coherent system. To benefit fully from exchanges of views, it is important to have a clearly focused policy framework, agreed and monitored at a high political level — one which provides a reference point from which Member States, should they wish, can draw to develop national policies and within which actions in the second phase of Leonardo da Vinci programme could be determined. Concluding remarks Many issues concerning lifelong learning affect the content and organization of vocational training. These are the responsibility of Member States. A vocational training policy framework at European level must rec­ ognize that there is no single European solution. But a clearly focused framework, supported by the var­ ious interests involved and which facilitates exchanges of information and experience in a structured way, could contribute significantly to the decision­making process in Member States. As the prosperity of the EU as a whole depends on the economic performance of its constituent parts, there is a common European interest in monitoring develop­ ments in vocational training in Member States and helping them implement policies to improve their sys­ tems. This interest was recognized by the Council Reso­ lution of 17 December 1999 which established a 'rolling agenda' for future work in the field of education and training. An Age of Learning, along with other Cedefop publications ­ particularly the second report on voca­ tional training research, which will be published during 2000 ­ will contribute to the development and imple­ mentation of this rolling agenda. ■ Steve Bainbridge F+ 30 31 49 01 17 sb@cedefop.eu.int \ *" 24 Le Magazine ■ #13 ■ 2000 
Youth policy The White Paper on youth policy in the European Union responds not only to a request by the Member States and European Parliament but also to the expectations of young people themselves. The document will deal with the situation of young people in the Union and try to identify new ways of meeting their concerns. It is an initiative which could lend real substance to the policy­Initiating role Community cooperation has played in the youth field for a number of years now. It is quite different from a purely programming approach which tries simply to supplement, simplify or adapt existing actions. A White Paper to get Europe moving It was at the Council of Youth Ministers under the Lux­ embourg presidency, on 28 October 1998, that the min­ isters expressed their desire to have access to regularly updated data on youth and their needs, common trends in youth policy at European level, and possible strategic options. The request received the European Parliament's backing in an own­initiative report. Much has changed in the youth field over the past five years. The implementation of the third phase of the Youth for Europe programme made it possible to support a series of targeted studies on youth and youth policy. The start­up of European Voluntary Service (EVS) gave a new impetus to the political debate and a major study on youth and youth policy has just been launched. There is now a considerable wealth of information available on youth and youth policy. Young people and the pertinent players will all contribute to the White Paper The Youth Council of 23 November 1999 welcomed the Commission's proposal to draw up a White Paper on youth policy in 2001. The Member States also stressed the need to ensure that young people themselves are able to provide input. For this reason, the Council gave its agreement in principle to the Commission's proposal to organize national youth conferences ("youth" being de­ fined as people aged between 15 and 25) in each Mem­ ber State in order to consult the young people them­ selves. These national conferences ­ to be held between May and September ­ will culminate in a European youth conference planned for October under the French presi­ dency. The Commission will support and coordinate the national conferences so as to guarantee a minimum of coherence in terms of timing and content, with the Member States retaining responsibility for practical im­ plementation. At the same time as consulting young people themselves, the Commission also intends to consult those responsible for youth policy at national level. It would like their con­ tribution to also express the views and expectations of local authorities involved in youth policy, and believes the latter should also provide input to the White Paper. The Commission will therefore be holding bilateral meet­ ings during the latter half of the year. Meetings of this kind could also be held with other sections of civil soci­ ety, as these play a major role in youth policy. The results of the studies mentioned at the beginning of this article will also provide useful subject matter for these consultations. Key themes for a fertile debate Civil society: young people are interested in active citizenship and are concerned by the environment Young people are an important element in this civil soci­ ety and must be able to participate in it actively as citizens concerned about so­ cial, political, economic and other mat­ ters. The routes to socialization taken by young people are changing all the time. Hence the need to update the debate on the in­ volvement of young people in society and to look both at the means which exist at present and those that must be invented, adapted or developed in order to promote this socialization. Outside the traditional framework of the home and school, youth clubs and various new forms of social or­ ganization must be taken into account. Another facet of the "civil society" sphere is the environment, which seems to be at the centre of the concerns of many young people in Europe. This concern is not only the expression of an interest in the subject but also generally reflects worries about the future. An awareness of environmen­ tal problems brings an understanding that the sum of individuals' behaviour is re­ sponsible for much wider problems which affect our commun future. In this respect, the problem of the environment, includ­ ing the urban environment, represents an opportunity to enter into dialogue and lasting relations with young people in the Union. Experience shows that youth clubs are generally aware and active in regard to these problems. Yet there is a flagrant fail­ ure to acknowledge actions of this kind in terms of education and socialization in the widest sense and a clear lack of coop­ r © Carl Cordonnier eration and complementarity between the youth field and the sectors. The Commission would like to take a closer look at the various aspects and questions linked to this problem in order to identify areas for action and reflection at Com­ munity and national level which would allow young peo­ ple to fulfil their role as responsible citizens.

W^­^FL .·* j* Economic structure and employment In this sphere of the discussion, the Commission plans to look at how society is structured from an economic point of view, the consequences of this structuring, and the re­ sponses to be made to meet the needs of young people in terms of integration into working life and society. Employment, or at least paid employment, has played an important role in modern societies as a determining fac­ tor in the independence of young people and, more gen­ erally, as a basis for a secure adult life. But employment also opens up socio­cultural possibilities which favour individual development. This is why preparation for par­ ticipation in working life has always been a central issue throughout the period of youth. Today a large majority of young people find it hard to obtain stable, paid em­ ployment. Unemployment is in the process of becoming a "normal social experience" and is establishing condi­ tions of insecurity, disorientation, social inequality and new forms of poverty among young people. The jobs which are available to young people are also often pre­ carious, short term and poorly paid. Many young people have responded to this situation by prolonging their studies, but others find themselves caught up in a spiral of exclusion. There is therefore a need to take a closer look at a certain number of points linked to employability and the fight against exclusion, and also at new approaches aimed at being able to participate fully in society which are not strictly wage­based. Well­being: a complex notion Well­being relates to the total environment of young people: their physical, psychological and social well­be­ ing; their search for well­being and the taking of certain risks. Young people aged between 15 and 25 are not exposed to any specific health risks. The development of their health at this age is a complex combination of biologi­ cal, psychological, social and cultural processes. A large proportion of young people suffer from poverty, the break­up of the family, lack of social support or poor diet: all factors which compromise growth and develop­ ment. In many Member States one in five young people is neither studying nor working. Studies on the health and attitudes of young people also show that young people are exposed to a large number of risks, even in everyday life. Every year 12,000 young people are killed in road accidents in the European Union and suicide is one of the three major causes of death among young people. Sexually transmitted diseases, the use of drugs for recreational purposes, the temptation to break the law (delinquency), and high risk physical activities can be added to the list. This is why the economic, social and cultural factors related to well­being must all be placed high on the political agenda. Prevention has an important role to play. It starts with information ­ which means finding the method and lan­ guage which stands a chance of being heard and a net­ work through which to transmit it. The messages on all these questions are complex and thus extremely difficult to formulate and transmit as they touch upon the deep­ seated emotions of young people. Autonomy of young people The transition process outside the parental home is changing as the period of study or training is being ex­ tended, the labour and housing markets are changing and people are waiting longer before starting a family. This situation raises the question of the autonomy of young people which is a precondition for any real partic­ ipation. It is not enough for this autonomy and freedom to be recognized in law: the material conditions for ex­ ercising it must also be met. The process of leaving the family home, as an inherent part of a broader transition, is not only affected by struc­ tures of education and training, social security/protec­ tion and employment, but also by the housing market. The situation on the housing market has consequences for many aspects of the life of young people: it affects the scope for young people to develop an independent lifestyle in keeping with their own values and ideas, it af­ fects the transition to the employment market and it is a key factor in the decision to start a family. The meetings planned in the Member States could be the occasion to link up with young people to look at all these various aspects in order to identify ways of in­ creasing their opportunities for autonomy in a chang­ ing society. Europe: young people have high hopes Europe is a reality for young people. Today's young peo­ ple envisage living their lives in this wider area and want to develop in a world without borders. The most recent Eurobarometer survey showed that more than a third of them believe the European Union represents a better fu­ ture. But young people are not content to just dream about Europe ­ they want to be actively involved in building it. They see the treaties as no more than the foundations for a concrete Europe devoted to improving the everyday lives of all its citizens: 75% of the young people interviewed expect a determined initiative to combat the scourge of unemployment that currently af­ fects 20% of them. It will be interesting to use these national meetings as an opportunity to get beyond the clichés and join with young people in taking an in­depth look at a number of questions relating to the new and evolving European area. ■ Further information Sylvie Viandas, Education and Culture DG F + 32 2 99 41 58 j& Λ' t h 26 Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 
Young people and sport Youth activities to include more physical exercise Making the most of an informal educational potential As a source of physical exercise, sport is universally recognized as an important part of young people's education. Not only does it contribute to the their physical well­being, it also builds communication skills, respect for others, a sense of responsibility and social integration. Increasingly often, it also provides a means of access to working life. Despite this unanimous recognition of the potential benefits of sport, when it comes to putting youth poli­ cies ­ or informal education ­ into practice, the Mem­ ber States and Community youth programmes tend to view physical exercise as a threat to the educational content of youth activities, rather than a key area in which informal education can be developed. Behind this reality which promises so little for the de­ velopment of such a potential lies the feeling that, in most cases, sports events do not allow young people to be the initiators, organizers or key players in projects that satisfy the principles of informal education. But there may be another explanation: the general fear among those involved in youth work of seeing "institu­ tionalized" sport monopolize the available resources to the detriment of non­sports associations which are the real driving force behind the programme. The European Commission wants to draw on the informal educational potential of sport in Community programmes for young people. Whatever the case, the fact remains that the present situation reflects neither the interest of young Euro­ peans in sport' nor the importance of physical exercise in present­day youth culture. The Commission has real­ ized the need to take a close look at what should be done to allow Community actions and programmes According to the Eurobarometer survey (Young Europeans, 1997), 27.6% of young Europeans are members of sports clubs. aimed at young people to draw more benefit from the informal educational potential of sport. To do so, a study was commissioned and carried out in 1999 (available on the Education and Culture DG Inter­ net site at: europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/education_cul­ ture/index_en.htm). This looks at relations between sport and youth structures in the Member States, cur­ rent thinking on the training role of sport and physical exercise, and the practices of the Community's Youth for Europe and European Voluntary Service pro­ grammes in including physical exercise activities in youth exchanges and voluntary service schemes. The study also formulates a number of recommendations for giving more space to sport and physical exercise in informal educational programmes for young people. Le Magazine ■ #13 · 2000 27 Y o t h M 
The question of sport in informal education was also of concern to Finland, which held the EU presidency between July and December 1999. It was the theme of a seminar of youth managers in Rovaniemi in Sep­ tember 1999. This exchange of opinions was followed by the adoption of a Resolution, initiated by the Finnish presidency, in which the Council of ministers responsible for youth policy acknowledge the infor­ mal educational potential of sport and invite the Commission to look at ways of ensuring that its youth programmes draw on this potential. The recently adopted Youth programme takes real account of physical exercise activities. The European Parliament and Council have adopted the Youth programme (2000­2006) and the imple­ menting procedures are now being discussed. A num­ ber of measures can be identified that would bring increased recognition for physical exercise activities in the programme, such as: the clarification of certain concepts to avoid a loss of the educational value of youth and other exchange activities as a result of in­ eluding elements particular to sport (teams for exam­ ple), specific training for youth workers, and informa­ tion specifically targeted at associations interested in the informal educational dimension of sport, includ­ ing sports clubs. The Youth programme will clearly not be a source of alternative financing for competitions or other sports activities. It is more a matter of including physical ex­ ercise in the programme's activities ­ youth ex­ changes, youth initiatives, voluntary service ­ so as to enable them to realize their full educational potential by drawing on a fundamental feature of present­day youth culture. Lifelong benefits Sport and adventure activities play an important role for young people. This is because they influ­ ence their future behaviour in working life or as citizens, according to Professor Peter Becker of the University of Marburg (Germany), who took part in the study. He illustrates his point with some con­ crete examples. Sports training, he explains, re­ quires the young person to "assimilate fundamen­ tal choices such as planning training for a precise goal, pacing oneself to conserve the available phys­ ical capacities, keeping an on­going record of per­ formances and adjusting objectives, rationally co­ ordinating training periods and the dates of competitive events, etc." Competitive sport also has a positive effect: "somebody who follows the rules of the game learns not only that performance is fairly rewarded with a ranking but also that, even if the inequality inherent in the ranking has to be ac­ cepted, it can be corrected by appropriate personal efforts." Training plus competing in sports events therefore helps the young person to redefine his or her identity outside the family framework. Individuals certainly have to create a stable identi­ ty, but this must not be too stable if they want to remain open to new experiences, continues Profes­ sor Becker, praising the benefits of adventure. "It is only the individual who is ready to open up to what is foreign, new and unknown and to assimilate these experiences who is able to evolve. People who do not do this remain locked into repetitive rou­ tines. Which amounts to a conscious rejection of training and development." He goes on to say that "when you travel down fast­flowing rivers, cross mountainous regions and dense forests, make dif­ ficult climbs, cycle across a foreign country or pit your strength against waves and currents, you are having fun and at the same time confronting unfa­ miliar situations. You learn what it means to exceed your limits, to break with routine, to have to take a decision on which there is no going back, assess al­ ternative solutions, and take responsibilities within a group or solve conflicts in a rational manner in order to take control of a situation." ■ iß Y o u th 28 Le Magazine · #13 ■ 2000 
The best way to communicate information is to get young people to talk directly with other young people. With this principle firmly in mind, 50 students from 30 European countries volunteered to act as ambassadors for the Socrates programme. Le Magazine caught up with them in Brussels where they spent a week training before going out into the field. The students are members of three associations: ESIB, AEGEE and ESN(1). The pilot project received financial support from the European Commission. Young ambassadors for Socrates On this second day of training, the small room on the rue Grétry in Brussels is packed full. Not an empty chair any­ where. All 50 students are there, and on time. Yet to judge from the tired faces and the knowing looks, the previous evening must have been a long one. The group ­ made up of 30 different nationalities ­ is evidently closely­knit, energetic and highly motivated. First on the agenda this morning is information and a de­ bate on Erasmus. Three representatives of the European Commission ­ Massimo Gaudina, Anne Serizier and Tor­ björn Gronner ­ introduce the discussion. The first briefly outlines the Erasmus structure. The second recalls the history of the programme and the important introduc­ tion of institutional contracts in 1997. The third presents a number of statistical tables. But they are soon inter­ rupted by the students. The debate immediately takes a non­academic turn as the questions are fired in rapid succession, each one pertinent and to the point. Personal testimonies... Grzegorz and Piotr ­ Poland Grzegorz is studying European law and economics at the University of Poznan. He is a member of ESN, the association of Erasmus students. Piotr is studying business administration at the University of Gdansk, in the north of the country, and belongs to AEGEE. So what do they see as the major obstacles to Polish stu­ dents participating in Socrates? They both agree: the main obstacle to mobility is the difference in living standards between Poland and the EU Member States. This means that the Erasmus grant is not enough to live on. But this is not the only obstacle. They are also agreed on the lack of information. " Many Polish stu­ dents still believe that Socrates is not open to them," says Piotr. "The universities do not provide enough in­ formation," adds Grzegorz. So how to make up for this lack of promotion? Grzegorz does not think newslet­ ters are much use. He believes that if you want to con­ vince people, you have to meet them face to face. His first step after the Brussels training seminar will be to make an appointment with university officials in the west of Poland in order to convince them of the need for better targeted and "fresher" information. Kristin ­ Austria Kristin is studying languages (English and Spanish) at the University of Graz. She recently spent six months in Valadolid, Spain as part of the Erasmus student mo­ bility action. She applied for an Erasmus grant almost by chance. But she had no problem being selected. "If you are studying languages you have an advantage over the others." Now back home in Austria, she would like to give fur­ ther expression to her commitment to Europe. That is why she has accepted the presidency of ESN's local section. What does she think must be done to get more Austrian students involved in Socrates? First, provide good information. Second, get rid of the red tape. Kristin plans to visit six universities to promote not just Erasmus but also Grundtvig, Minerva and Lin­ gua. She plans to ask for permission to speak in the lecture theatres in order to reach the maximum num­ ber of students at one time. Carlo ­ Italy Carlo is studying political science at the University of Cagliari in Sardinia. "We Sardinians, living on an is­ land, are used to travelling. We are used to crossing the sea to travel to destinations in Italy. To go to an­ other European country is not much further." Erasmus candidates from Cagliari are spoilt in a sense. On top of their European grant they also receive fi­ nancial support from the university and regional gov­ ernment. But despite this, student participation in Socrates is too low. Carlo sees a reason for this. Many students on Sardinia come from families with very modest incomes. They often have to work at the same time to finance their studies ­ and it is very difficult for them to give up these jobs in order to participate in European mobility. Andrei, a Romanian student, asks whether a student who is not a national of an eligible country but who is legal­ ly resident in one and is enrolled as a full­time student there can participate in Erasmus. The answer is yes. Mar­ co, an Italian, asks whether it is possible to split an Eras­ mus period into two. No. The rule is that the mobility must cover a continuous period of between 3 and 12 months, without interruption. In other words, it is not possible to travel abroad for two months, return home, and then go back to the foreign university for a further two months. Other students have questions about some of the very practical details. Must Erasmus students pay for additional activities, such as library access? Are stu­ dents from Central and Eastern European countries cov­ ered in the event of health problems which may arise when studying at an EU university? There have been problems in these areas. A Hungarian student wants to know what the selection criteria are for Erasmus stu­ dents. The Commission suggests that the universities should judge on the basis of three priorities: the acade­ mic merits of the student, language skills, and motiva­ tion. But in practice the universities are free to decide as they see fit. Nevertheless, if any student feels he is the victim of an injustice, he or she should inform the Socrates national agency in the home country. Could do better At the end of the week's training session in Brussels, the 50 young students will serve as 'ambassadors' for Socrates for one year, while also promoting other pro­ grammes which may interest their colleagues, such as Tempus, Leonardo da Vinci or Youth. Erasmus, a central pillar of the Socrates programme, is known to be a grow­ ing success among students and their universities. But still the information is not circulating among students as it should be. The communication products are not suffi­ ciently adapted to the language of young people. Also, many of the institutions involved lack the resources to reach large numbers of students. "Could do better" is the verdict on the information effort. Which is why this pro­ ject ­ known as "Socrates on the move" ­ is founded on equipping the students themselves to help spread the message. "If you want something done properly, do it yourself," as the proverb says. These 50 volunteers have undertaken to organize at least five information actions, in the form of special events, at their home country universities. They will be meeting in the spring, summer and autumn to exchange their expe­ riences, with a final conference scheduled for December. This final meeting will aim to draw more general conclu­ sions on the operation and to submit proposals to the European Commission. The 50 young ambassadors come from three European organizations: ESIB, AEGEE and ESN. ESIB, a more politi­ cal organization, federates the national student unions in 35 European countries. AEGEE represents locally­ based student organizations which concentrate on pro­ viding services. ESN is an organization for Socrates alum­ ni and endeavours to ensure Erasmus students receive the best possible support. These three organizations can therefore be viewed as mutually complementary. Togeth­ er, they comprehensively represent the student world. A first Manja Kiemende, the ESIB general secretary, coordinat­ ed the Brussels training session.

But first and foremost because "it is also the first time the three organizations have cooperated on a joint project. The Commission recognizes that we are well placed to inform students. That is a very positive sign." Following this pilot information action, Manja Klemencic and her colleagues from the other organizations have further hopes for the future. The three associations are already considering stepping up their cooperation by creating a joint structure ­ while retaining their inde­ pendence ­ in the form of a European student liaison group. "We want to build up lasting relations with the European Commission," Manja explains. "We would like to see the Commission adopt the practice of consulting this group on a regular basis on all matters of concern to us." First circulating the information, then providing in­ put to policy... The students are certainly committed to the cause. Erasmus students and finances At the request of the European Parliament, the Com­ mission conducted a major survey on the socio­eco­ nomic circumstances of Erasmus students. In all, 9,500 students ­ which is considered to be a very big sample ­ completed a questionnaire circulated among 150 universities in the 15 EU countries. The survey related to the 1997/1998 academic year. The findings make interesting reading. For most students, financial difficulties experienced during the period of mobility depend on two main factors: ­ whether or not they live with their parents in the home country; ­ the existence of a national policy of financial aid and the amounts awarded. Students who live with their parents spend twice as much abroad as they do when at home. In their case accommodation costs in the host country account for two­thirds of the additional costs, while the Erasmus grant covers just 40% of extra costs. By contrast, for students who do not live with their parents the Eras­ mus grant covers 80% of the additional costs. Another finding is that the students who receive most financial support experience the greatest financial difficulties abroad. This is the case for the Greeks and Portuguese, whose Erasmus grant is nevertheless twice the European average. This situation is due to the dif­ ferences in the cost of living in the host countries and the relatively low level of national aid Greece and Por­ tugal provide. It is often thought that Erasmus students are among the most privileged in socio­economic terms. But the results of the Commission survey show that this does not appear to be the case: 53% of Erasmus students describe their parents' income as "average" or "low". The Commission formulates a number of concrete rec­ ommendations on the basis of the survey. It stresses the role of student organizations in making access to Erasmus easier for students who do not come from a privileged background. It also suggests that the size of Erasmus grants should be based on the socio­econom­ ic circumstances of the students. ■ «■ E d t i on 30 Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 
"The main aim of the project was to learn to be European, to understand the diversity of learning," says Leena Kaikkonen, from Finland. She coordinated the Seneca project, backed by the European Commission's Comenius initiative, to offer in­service training for teachers of students with special educational needs. The 19 participants came from 16 different countries of the EU and Central and Eastern Europe.

"I thought the participants would do something that would change the world," she laughs. "But what happened was that people learned to understand that, when it comes to dis­ cussing special needs, we are all dealing with similar types of issues. The course demonstrated that by listen­ ing to and learning from each other, we can tackle these problems in a variety of ways." The highlight of the Seneca (Special Educational Needs European Competence Advancement) project was a one­ week training module entitled Educating Everyone To­ gether, held in September 1999 at the Jyväskylä Poly­ technic in Finland, and supported by Comenius ­ a strand of the Socrates programme. Teachers came from widely diverse backgrounds: two each from France, Germany and Spain, with individual participants from Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portu­ gal, Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ro­ mania and Poland. Networking Leena Kaikkonen believes that one of its most innovative achievements was the launch of an intranet network, which the teachers continue to use long after their re­ turn home. During the course, each participant had to draw up an action plan for his or her own school and post it on the intranet, for the group to discuss. "I was surprised how much they used it," she says. "I had planned to close the Intranet around Christmas time, but they asked me to keep it open. It was one feature that made this a little different from other Comenius projects. I am very enthusiastic about it, even though I am not a very technical person. Even now, some of the teachers still go to the network." A project website was also set up to inform the partici­ pants about each other and the course itself. Francesco Scaramuzzi, who teaches psychology at a vocational sec­ ondary school in Bari, southern Italy, found it invaluable. "It was easy to connect with other people when we ar­ rived in Jyväskylä," he explains. "Really, we were 'inte­ grated' from the first moment, and able to work togeth­ er. Creating communication among a group of people coming from 16 different countries was a merit of the course organization." Son of Seneca Francesco Scaramuzzi has used the intranet to cooperate with participants David Cropp from the UK and Sirkku Purontaus from Finland to develop a new project, enti­ tled Sentra (Special Educational Needs Transition), which has since been submitted to the Commission. The project will help teachers to develop ways of integrating young­ sters with special needs during the difficult transition periods between secondary and higher education and work. "Sentra is, in a way, the son of Seneca," he says. For him, the course was an "important experience" which has transformed his approach to both special needs and other pupils. Thirty­two of his school's 800 students have disabilities ranging from mobility problems and deafness to Downs Syndrome and autism. Special needs pupils are Officially' integrated into ordinary classes, but this is easier said than done, he argues. "Achieving real integra­ tion is a day­by­day job for each teacher. Comparing dif­ ferent ways of solving special needs problems was a spur to changing our organization. My colleagues and I now feel surer about starting from similar experiences in oth­ er countries". Integration "We have to think of special needs pupils as all those who have trouble following normal courses of study," Francesco Scaramuzzi feels. "With the new situation in Europe, with immigrants who have difficulty with lan­ guage and pupils coming from difficult social environ­ ments, we have to use communication and integration skills to avoid drop­outs and failures among all students. In short, the point is to understand differences, to be able to accept other points of view, and to respect different cultures and different ways of living." Sirkku Purontaus was also attracted to the course by the opportunity to compare approaches to special needs teaching. She is a senior lecturer at Kokkola College of Social Services and Health Care in Finland, where stu­ dents with mild learning difficulties and more severe mental conditions study for vocational qualifications in home economics. "One question arising on the course was 'who has special needs? The child, the teacher, the school, the parents, society?' This philosophical aspect is most important," she insists. Humour Groups of five teachers from different countries worked together to design their own school, planning its philos­ ophy, curriculum and organization. "The people on the course were the best thing," declares Purontaus. "The at­ mosphere was open, and everyone had space to speak and listen. We also used a lot of humour." The five Seneca project partners (one each in Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands, and two in the UK) brought together teachers themselves to draw up the course curriculum. "The basic idea was to listen to teach­ ers in the field telling us about the difficulties they have in coping with students with special needs," explains Leena Kaikkonen. In the end, much of the preparation time was taken up with getting to know the educational systems in the different countries, and accommodating their different approaches in the project. Seneca is now in its third year, and work is focusing on evaluation and dissemination of the lessons learnt. The coordinator has sent out a questionnaire to collect feed­ back from the participants. Kaikkonen insists that the project report must reflect "the voice of ordinary teach­ ers, in ordinary schools". But she believes it must also help future project organisers to avoid the pitfalls lying in wait for first­timers. This evaluation is especially impor­ tant because the Seneca course is due to be rerun in Tallinn, Estonia, in May 2001. "The most important thing about Socrates as a whole is that it teaches us to work European­wide," concludes Kaikkonen. "In the beginning, the course content is per­ haps of secondary importance. But it is easier to get ac­ quainted if you have something in common and, in the end, shared interests will keep us together as friends." ■ Le Magazine ■ #13­ ■ 2000 31 E d u 1 o n fà·" 
Reforms incorporated in the new Comenius action will touch upon a range of areas including language learning and teaching, and school management. The scheme now offers everyone involved in school education ­ in the widest sense ­ the chance to add an extra European dimension to their work. Comenius: changes and improvements The success of Comenius in its initial phase (1996­1999) is clear from the figures: more than 10,000 schools par­ ticipated in European Education Projects and more than 5,000 teachers from all over Europe attended in­service training courses abroad. In its second phase (2000­2006), as part of the Socrates programme, Comenius will play an even more important role in enhancing the quality and reinforcing the European dimension of school education. Its overall budget has been increased fivefold for the new seven­year period, and the programme has undergone major restructuring. It takes in new fields of activity. For example, school partnerships and projects for the training of educational staff can now address the management and administra­ tive level of school Ufe. Also, language learning has be­ come one of the programme's key issues since much of the former Lingua action has been incorporated into Comenius. Intercultural education and education for dis­ advantaged pupils, formerly targeted under Comenius action 2, are now transversal priorities for the whole pro­ gramme. And support for Comenius networks (action 3) ¡s a completely new initiative which has the potential to enhance significantly the impact of all Comenius pro­ jects. The school as part of the wider community A school does not just operate within its four walls. It is a multi­dimensional interaction of learners and educa­ tors set against a complex social and economic back­ ground. Comenius fully appreciates this. All administra­ tive and educational personnel involved in school education are invited to take part in Comenius projects or benefit from mobility grants. And the range of poten­ tial participating institutions in Comenius now goes be­ yond the traditional educational institutions such as schools, teacher training centres, universities and re­ search centres, to include associations, non­government organizations and even private companies which offer pupils internships in preparation for their future careers. Better school management has also become an issue for Comenius, and the newly introduced "School Develop­ ment Projects" within Comenius 1 (School Partnerships) are designed to tackle any structural problems arising from the specific social and economic conditions affect­ ing individual schools or school education in general. In this context it is important to underline that even though there is no direct equivalent to the former Come­ nius action 2 in the new programme, projects on inter­ cultural education and education of children of gypsies, migrants, migrant workers and socially disadvantaged pupils have by no means disappeared. On the contrary, intercultural education and combating school failure have become transversal priorities throughout the Comenius action. Language learning in Comenius The second phase of Comenius also now includes four former Lingua actions which aim to improve the quality and quantity of language teaching and learning. Togeth­ er, these very successful actions have done much to pro­ mote the less widely used and less taught languages and have enabled nearly 40,000 teachers and pupils each year to travel abroad to improve their language skills. Practical language­based projects which include a class exchanges between two groups of school pupils (former Lingua E) are incorporated into Comenius I.The relevant sections for language teacher training projects, in­ser­ vice training courses, and Language Assista n tships (for­ mer Lingua A, B, and C) are now included in Comenius 2. Emphasis on mobility Learning and teaching in different places is a reward­ ing experience for pupils and teachers alike. Comenius aims to foster this. Mobility plays an increasingly impor­ tant role within Comenius, following the integration of language teacher training provision, language assistant­ ships and language­related class exchanges within the school partnerships. Moreover, in Comenius 1 the mobil­ ity of project participants has been made easier from an administrative point of view. It is also now possible for up to four pupils per class, who are actively involved in the development of a school project or a school development project, to travel abroad with their teachers for project meetings with their foreign partners. Comenius networks to the fore on 21 September A new and very promising action for the future ­ Come­ nius 3 ­ came into being on 1 January with the creation of the Comenius networks. Although a few networks be­ gan to be set up following the launch of Socrates, this re­ mains largely unexplored territory. So what is the purpose of a Comenius network? Above all to encourage sustained cooperation between projects based on partnerships between schools (Comenius 1 ) and projects relating to the training of educational staff (Comenius 2). These projects are therefore a starting point for going further, but in the framework of a pre­ cisely defined subject of general interest, such as Euro­ pean citizenship, education on the environment, the ed­ ucational use of the new information and communication technologies, schools and the world of work, combating violence, etc. The Comenius networks permit synergy between projects in secondary education. They must involve at least six partners and are designed to create a snowball effect. The aim is to increase the number of projects on a given theme and enhance their impact by boosting their qual­ ity. The Comenius networks will both capitalize on inter­ esting practices and positive achievements which are in­ sufficiently known, and extend and improve the use of the new information and communication technologies, in particular the Internet. Two important dates should be noted: the Comenius net­ works promotion day in Brussels on 21 September; and the deadline for submitting pre­projects for Comenius networks for 2001 on 1 November. ■ Further information Detlev Clemens, Education and Culture DG F + 32 2 299 37 30 % E d u c­ t i on 32 Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 
© A Lingua assistant in Sweden gives her account... Yamina Ahmed­Brahim, a young French teacher, spent eight months as a Lingua assistant in a village in the far north of Sweden. What kind of welcome did she receive? What did her work involve? How did she set about learning Swedish? Yamina learned a lot from her experience in the country. She is convinced that the way to really improve the learning of foreign languages is by strengthening the link with the social context. Linking language to real life When Le Magazine contacted Yamina Ahmed­Brahim on a March afternoon, the temperature in Öjebyn was 2°C. For this village in the far north of Sweden, it was as if summer had arrived. The snow was melting. There was even a certain balminess in the air, whereas the same temperature in Paris means a cold snap. When she ap­ plied for a post in Sweden, Yamina was looking for a new experience. She certainly found it. To start at the beginning... Yamina, 23, is a newly quali­ fied French teacher. She studied in the Paris area, where she gained a higher diploma in teaching French as a for­ eign language. Yamina's work therefore involves teach­ ing French to people who know nothing about the cus­ toms, culture or language of France. "If I was going to have any professional credibility," she reasoned, "then I had to spend time myself in a foreign country and expe­ rience the same situations as the foreigners I would be teaching. I wanted to go to a country I knew absolutely nothing about. Hence my idea of going to Sweden." Yamina applied to go there as a "language assistant" un­ der Lingua Action C of the Socrates programme. Not without some surprise, she quickly received a positive re­ ply. "Release mechanism for words" So off she set to Öjebyn, in Sweden's distant north. Yam­ ina arrived there on 29 September for an eight­month assistantship. She was warmly welcomed by her super­ vising teacher, Britt Öqvist. "My hostess had arranged everything. I stayed with her at first, and then moved in with a host family." At first Yamina communicated in English. But she soon decided she should learn Swedish. She attended classes in the neighbouring town of Piteå and within a few months found she was making remarkable progress. "Now that I can express myself in Swedish I feel more au­ tonomous. I am no longer frightened to answer the tele­ phone. I watch films on TV and can understand the Swedish subtitles," she explains. © Gunnar Westergren The school in Öjebyn where Yamina is based is a college for 12­ to 15­year­olds. After a brief settling­in period, she started giving French classes at the school, alternat­ ing with Britt. Yamina bases her teaching on mime, role plays and sketches, "lama release mechanism for words," is how she likes to describe it. The fact that the pupils are directly confronted with a French person acts as a trig­ ger. "For them, speaking to me in French has become a necessity. The social justification for speaking the lan­ guage has become apparent." Yamina has also become aware of the differences be­ tween the French and Swedish school systems. "In Swe­ den there are more meetings between the teachers. There are more group projects. The relationships are less bound by hierarchy." Yamina also ventures some comparisons in connection with language teaching itself. "The main for­ eign language here is English. The pupils learn this from a very young age and are very talented. But when it comes to the second language ­ Spanish, German or French ­ the methods remain quite traditional and not much different from those in France." Yamina also draws some interesting lessons from her own experiences in studying Swedish. "When you teach a for­ eign language, the first thing you tend to teach is the vo­ cabulary of the home. But it is the environment in which you find yourself in the host country which determines what you need to learn first. In my case the vocabulary linked to the school was paramount. That confirmed my idea that when teaching a language you should place yourself in the social context. The lessons must be linked to very concrete situations in life." A multiple role Yamina has progressively gained in confidence over the months and increased her activities, in cooperation with her host teacher. Every week she now visits primary schools in the area and organizes activities ­ in French ­ with even the very youngest children. "If you want lan­ guage teaching to be effective, you must start in prima­ ry school. That is the best time, because at that age chil­ dren are very inquisitive." The role of the Lingua assistant is in fact a very varied one, points out Yamina. "I fulfil a kind of continuous training role in regard to the Swedish teachers of French. I am the teachers' teacher." Independently of the college and primary schools, Yamina has recently started giving free French evening classes to a group of parents, and also teaches at an adult education centre. She is also often asked to give talks describing the French education system. "I am often asked to make compar­ isons between the two countries. But I am very careful in that area and do not allow myself to make any value judgement on the subject. Good ideas can certainly be taken here and there from the two systems. But I do not believe it is possible to mechanically transpose one sys­ tem from one country to another." "The best year in my teaching career" Britt Öqvist, the French teacher in Öjebyn who played host to Yamina, will long remember the ex­ perience. "The result was very positive, both for the pupils and for myself, in our practice of the French language. I hope that Yamina's visits to the prima­ ry school classes will motivate more of them to choose French as their second foreign language. I was very lucky in having an assistant who was so charming and talented, who was able to adapt im­ mediately to the pupils and who always had new ideas. It was so nice to have a French colleague! It was a year unlike any other for me... certainly the best in my whole teaching career." Lingua C, in brief Grants under Lingua C (Socrates programme) give future language teachers the chance to spend be­ tween three and eight months as a language assis­ tant at a school in another participating country where one of the official languages is usually a lan­ guage which the teacher will later teach. Nevertheless, in order to give priority to languages less widely used and taught, an exception may be made to allow Lingua assistants to go to a country where one of these languages is spoken, even if they will later teach another language. During the school years 1996­1997 and 1997­1998, a total of 1,087 Lingua assistants were able to ben­ efit from the European Commission's financial sup­ port in this way. From 2001 the action will be included under the Comenius chapter (school education) and renamed "Comenius Linguistic Assistantship". ■ Le Magazine ■ #13 · 2000 33 L a ng & 
New technologies The economy and jobs are normally cited as the reasons for introducing new technologies in schools ­ and information and communication technologies (ICTs) will undoubtedly be vital in training the workers, artists and researchers of the future. But we must also keep sight of the real reason for using these new technologies in schools. Actions financed under the Socrates programme place the emphasis firmly on their educational, cultural and social dimensions. Contrasting technologies for the school of the future Socrates pilot projects in the field of the use of new technologies in education ­ Socrates­ODL (open and dis­ tance learning) and shortly Socrates Minerva ­ come in many forms. Some place the emphasis on the pupil play­ ing an active role and being aware that during the learn­ ing process he or she is simultaneously initiator, creator and player. Others highlight the use of technology in the context of educational pathways already defined by pro­ grammes, disciplines and exams. Of course it is not ulti­ mately a question of being confined to any one alterna­ tive. In reality various models exist. The various scenarios presented in this article are based on these projects, but no explicit reference in made to any particular project. Contrasting learning scenarios Advocates of a "back to basics" approach believe that the use of technologies, in a manner appropriate to the goals pursued, requires constraint and self­discipline. An initial scenario can be evoked: A big square classroom. Computer screens set up along the walls. A pupil studying in front of each one. The class is linked up to the school's intranet. In learning to read, each pupil is presented with a series of texts to read within a given time. Progress bars at the top of the screen indicate where he or she is in his reading and the time available. Once the reading time is expired the pupil receives a series of comprehension questions on the text. (...) At another session of this kind ­ in geography ­ the pupil visits a series of websites to explore the ge­ ography of the American continent. Using the school's intranet, which filters the authorized addresses and de­ fines a series of possible links, the pupil accesses sites abroad. By means of a series of cut and paste operations and the many illustrations made available by a person­ alized multimedia publisher, the pupil is able to draw up an on­line report for the teacher. Advocates of a more "constructivist" approach place the emphasis on the pupil's more active role in building up his or her own knowledge. This gives rise to a radically different learning scenario: Another big classroom, which looks more like a huge workshop divided into individual areas by movable par­ titions. A large model stands in the middle of the class­ room. The pupils are in the process of constructing a scale model of Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine. The model is the focal point around which several work ta­ bles are arranged. At one, pupils are engaged in debate on Leonardo da Vinci's life and the state of knowledge at that time. At another a teacher is holding a discussion on the way the various pupils conceive of the principles of air navigation. Several computers are set up next to the library section which the pupils can use at any time for an information search. Some are being used for mea­ surements and simulations. At one computer a group of three pupils are writing their project report. They are us­ ing the computer's spellcheck function to improve their text. One may well wonder what the classroom of the future will be like. Will there still be a classroom? Will pupils have a desk, telephone and e­mail access for au­ tonomous or group activities? Cultural as well as educational implications Other scenarios can be sketched depending on whether ­ to take the two extremes ­ the culture is "internation­ al" or "local". In a first model, schools provide their pupils with educa­ tional resources developed at global level. These educa­ tional products and services are designed to be adapted to regional or national curricula. The process is one of exploration based on various pro­ jects: For part of the programme, pupils have access to a set of interactive modules marketed by a major cinema pro­ duction company. Guided by characters from one of their favourite films, they embark on a series of adven­ ture games to discover new galaxies. One involves analysing the origin of rocks brought back from various interstellar voyages. The earth itself can also be the sub­ ject of various 'lessons'. The pupil's astrolab is linked up to experts and scientists around the world to whom he can put questions. In another model, it is the pupils' own production of re­ sources which lies at the centre of the educational process. Multimedia sites and content are created on the basis of particular interests, groups of students or teach­ ers. They are all occasions to learn. The groupings are on the basis of an affinity, cooperation between 'peers' or the instructions of 'tutors'. In this model the emphasis is on local culture or the intercultural dimension, rather than on global culture. Languages, customs, occupations can all give rise to the creation of resources. There is also an emphasis on common roots extending beyond the indi­ vidual locality. Sites can be created by young migrants, for example, who share ­ across Europe's borders ­ the same desire to discover their common cultural heritage and make it known to others. Another example could be the discovery of common myths, such as that of Don Juan, which take different form depending on the country. Yet another model concentrates on physical devices in addition to the virtual explorations: A karaoke machine has been set up in one school. The equipment has had a big impact on the pupils' ability to learn foreign languages. The system also makes it pos­ sible to edit the lyrics. The pupils have fun replacing a song's original words with a pastiche. This stimulates their imagination and their practice of the languages concerned (...) For science subjects, the students have helped produce a series of models reproducing the col­ lection of scientific objects in Coimbra originally assem­ bled to educate the 'princes' of Portugal. A major Euro­ pean firm has expressed interest in the project and will be developing a series of plastic toys on this same basis. There are also multimedia modules produced by a local museum which illustrate the mechanical principles in­ volved. These imaginary explorations ­ but nevertheless based on many current experiments ­ raise the question not so much of what will be the long­term effects of technolo­ gy on education, but rather of re­thinking education it­ self. It is not technical skills which are needed to develop more open models for ICTs in school, but the ability to manage group work, project and other so­called active teaching methods, and disciplines to develop multi­dis­ ciplinary educational pathways. It is on the basis of these skills that the fabric will be cre­ ated ­ with the pupils and respecting their different styles ­ within which the new technologies will be used in the education of the future. ■ Further information Corinne Hermant­de Callatay, Education and Culture DG F + 32 2 296 69 92 % E d u Ι ι 34 Le Magazine · #13 ■ 2000 
Study Among the findings of the latest edition of Key data on education ¡n Europe is that the teaching of languages and information technologies is central to tomorrow's education systems Key data on education in Europe The fourth edition of Key data on education in Europe comprises, as did the previous editions, a combination of statistical data and descriptive information on the orga­ nization and operation of European education systems. This document offers a comparative vision of the efforts being made in the field of education in 29 European countries (the Member States of the Union, the EFTA/EEA and the pre­accession countries) and introduces two new chapters. The first collects together data on teaching for­ eign languages; the second contains a range of new in­ dicators relating to information and communication technology. Most of the other indicators combine to up­ date the data contained in the previous edition, but, in each chapter, new indicators have been added. The chap­ ters examine, among other things, the insecure nature of youth employment, ways in which education systems are steered and the role of parents on school boards; analyse the content of new pre­primary curricula and changes in participation at the end of compulsory education; com­ pare language teaching in the general and vocational streams, the ages at which teachers retire and the per­ centage of them that are approaching retirement age. Increasing numbers of young people are continuing to study after the end of compulsory education The younger generations are remaining in education longer, but the rate at which they leave the education system after the compulsory period varies from one country to another. This is explained in part by the age at which they are no longer required to study, but also, in some countries, by well­established traditions in youth culture. Thus in Belgium, Germany, France, the Nether­ lands, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland and Slovenia, fewer youngsters quit studying before they have at least completed the upper secondary level. Insecure jobs are more often taken by young people Penetration of young people into the job market presents a particular profile. The young suffer most from unem­ ployment, whatever the overall level of unemployment in their country. What is more, when they find work un­ der the age of 25, it is more likely to be an insecure job than that of older people. In this respect, the pre­acces­ sion countries differ from countries within the EU: the proportion of young people in uncertain work is clearly lower. It is the same as that in the active population as a whole. All the countries have set up one form or other of steering the education system Although the public authorities retain a great deal of re­ sponsibility in matters of school education, we are wit­ nessing the progressive decentralization of management of the education system. In many countries, to accompa­ ny this decentralization, measures are taken such as the requirement for institutions to draw up plans or project­ ed activities and to create management bodies at institu­ tion level. Quality control and the possibility of regulating and improving the functioning of the education system form part of the preoccupations of the political decision­ makers and are prerogatives that the public authorities re­ tain. Measures for guiding the education system have been established in a growing number of countries. Among these, the publication of the overall results ob­ tained in nationally recognized examinations is often used to measure the effectiveness of the educational system. More than 20% of teachers nearing the end of their careers A large proportion of European teachers are aged over 40, especially at secondary level. So in the years to come, one of the important issues of educational policy will be to face up to having to renew a large part of the body of teachers. By bringing large numbers of young, recently qualified teachers into the profession, education systems are going to be able to benefit from teachers better pre­ pared to face the challenges that confront the education systems, in particular those of teaching languages and information and communication technology. When esti­ mating the proportion of teachers who are in the last 10 years of their careers, it becomes apparent that the situ­ ation varies enormously between countries in the Union and the pre­accession countries. In the latter, at least a quarter of teachers are approaching retirement, while in the Union it is on average 10% (though there are large differences between countries). School systems are entering the age of information and communication The chapter on information and communication tech­ nology (ICT) clearly shows the priority being given from now on to this sector. Today ICT is integrated or is being integrated into the primary and secondary teaching pro­ grammes of all European countries. While at primary level ICT is more often used as a tool at the service of educational content, or for interdiscipli­ nary projects, at the secondary level it is more common­ ly presented as a separate subject. These different ap­ proaches are to be viewed in relation to the training teachers have received. ICT specialists are far more likely to be found at the secondary level. They teach ICT as a subject in its own right, while teachers of other subjects use it as a tool. Curricula in many countries have incorporated compul­ sory teaching of ICT to pupils, but the same does not go for the initial training of future primary or secondary school teachers. ICT is a compulsory'subjeet for trainee teachers in less than half of European countries. All pupils learn at least one foreign language during their time at school The increasingly important place occupied by languages in school curricula and the time that is devoted to them reflect the effort expended by European policy­makers, convinced that all their citizens should learn at least one foreign language. Reforms are under way in several countries in order to extend language teaching to all pupils in the near future. The transition phase currently under way for this area is often justified by the lack of language teachers who are capable of living up to this requirement, or by the difficulty of imposing the extra cost that would result from immediate implementation of the reforms on the current education budget. Although determination to defend the multilingual character of Europe is reiterated in official documents, English is almost everywhere the first foreign language studied by the greatest number of children in primary and general secondary education. In some countries, this is partly because those responsible have decided that learning this language should be compulsory for all pupils. ■ Further information Arlette Delhaxhe, Eurydice European Unit Τ+32 2 238 30 11 F+32 2 230 65 62 Le Magazine · #13 ■ 2000 35 E d u c a t ι o η ( g ·" 
Developments in national education systems CZECH REPUBLIC New law on foster care in the pipeline In September 1999, the Czech govern­ ment approved draft legislation on ed­ ucational establishments for children and young people needing institution­ al provision and care. The main aim of the proposed law is to set out ways of taking court decisions relating to institutional or protective education, or preliminary measures, in the establishments concerned. It seeks primarily to define the precise rights and responsibilities of the State and all other legal and physical entities in­ volved in or affected by this sector (in­ cluding the directors of institutions, the legal guardians of children and the children themselves). The draft legislation enumerates the various kinds of establishment with differing educational approaches, such as children's homes (détsky domov), de­ tention homes (détsky vychovny ustav) and diagnostic institutes. It establishes age limits for children in care and spec­ ifies the methods and conditions of the provision they receive. It also specifies the methods and amount of funding for institutional care, as well as the terms governing the payment of pock­ et money and material support for chil­ dren. FRANCE New grading system France has recently moved towards a more consistently structured system of higher education qualifications, along the lines discussed by the 29 European ministers who signed the Bologna Dec­ laration of 19 June 1999. The trans­ parency recommended by the ministers has been achieved in France through reviewing the concept of grade. The concept of grade refers to a com­ mon level of studies whatever the area of specialization or training structure concerned. Until last year, there were three grades, namely the baccalauréat (upper secondary school­leaving cer­ tificate, or 'bac + 0'), the licence (bac + 3) and the doctorat (bac + 8). The Mos­ rere, which completes this list, will be awarded to anyone holding a qualifica­ tion representing a state certificate at the level of bac + 5 [diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées, titre d'ingénieur diplômé, diplôme d'études approfondies), or qualifications of the same level included on a list established by decree. No existing qualifications will be abolished. For the first time, the same terms will apply to both universi­ ties and the grandes écoles in an at­ tempt to increase the transparency of the French higher education system. The licence professionnelle is intended for different groups who may have re­ ceived either general education (the diplôme d'études universitaires générales), or forms of vocational training, including the brevet de tech­ nicien supérieur [ETS) and diplôme uni­ versitaire de technologie (DUT), or continuing training. The new degree was designed to make it easier for such people to enter the labour market, al­ though the BTS and DUT retain their identity as qualifications in their own right. It was worked out in close con­ sultation with professional groups and will lead to employment at a level be­ tween that of technicien supérieur (ad­ vanced technician] and ingénieur (engineer). The first licences profes­ sionnelles will be awarded from the 2000 school year onwards. GREECE Technical vocational schools The institutional framework of reform in secondary education has been com­ pleted following adoption of Law 2640. It establishes an integrated system of technical/vocational education ensur­ ing school leavers flexible access to the labour market and job security. Studies in TVS last up to three years, and are organized in two stages, A and B, which include particular sectors and specializations. Stage A lasts two years and stage B, one. After passing examinations in common subjects at prefectorial level, stage A graduates are awarded a second­level degree and may also obtain a licence to exercise a profession; continue their studies in stage B; and enrol in the sec­ ond year of the Single Lykeio. After passing examinations in common subjects at national level, graduates from stage Β are awarded a third­level degree and may also obtain a licence to exercise a profession; secure priority enrolment in vocational training insti­ tutes (IEK); take examinations and en­ ter a technical vocational institute (TEI). NORWAY New eLearning strategy Norway has published a plan for infor­ mation and communication technolo­ gies (ICTs) in the education and training sector for the period 2000­2003. The plan emphasizes the incorporation of ICTs in education and training to take full advantage of the opportunities they offer as a resource for teaching and learning. It thus builds on the suc­ cess of the previous plan, which en­ couraged the development of individ­ ual user competence in the ICTs. The plan stresses the importance of a long­ term approach, with close cooperation between the authorities and educa­ tional institutions. Specific flagship projects will be used to stimulate fur­ ther developments. For example, a por­ tal for Norwegian education and train­ ing is to be established on the Internet. Teacher training will include the use of ICTs as an open and flexible method of teaching. A systematic approach to re­ search and development will investi­ gate their role in developing the school of the future. The focus is on creating the best possible learning environment for the user, whether a school pupil, student, teacher or an adult developing new skills. %■ E d t i on 36 Le Magazine · #13 · 2000 
POLAND New exam system In accordance with the new legislation on education (the Regulation of 19 April 1999 on Pupil Evaluation, Eligibility for Assessment, Promotion and Examinations and Tests in Public Schools), a new system for the ex­ ternal evaluation of pupils has been established. The main aims of the external evaluation system are: better quality control in education; support for diag­ nosis of pupil achievements; national­level comparison oftest and examination results. All tests and examinations will be organized by the agencies newly established in 1999, namely eight Re­ gional Examination Commissions supported and super­ vised by the Central Examination Commission. The re­ sponsibilities of Examination Commissions are: to prepare syllabuses for all required subjects on the basis of core curricula; to prepare tests and examinations, in accordance with the syllabuses; to conduct tests and examinations by trained and certified examiners; to analyse results, formulate findings, keep appropriate records and prepare reports for school directors, local authorities, regional educational authorities and, final­ ly, the Ministry of National Education; to devise and deliver training for teachers/examiners. The new system will consist of external standardized tests and examinations common to all schools. UNITED KINGDOM England, Wales and Northern Ireland Following devolution, Wales and Northern Ireland set up national assemblies in 1999 and assumed addition­ al responsibilities for education. The National Curriculum for primary and secondary ed­ ucation has recently been reviewed in England and Wales. Consequently, a revised National Curriculum will be introduced from September 2000. Reforms in Eng­ land include introducing personal, social and health education for all pupils aged 5­16, and introducing cit­ izenship as a compulsory subject for pupils aged 11­16 from 2002. The Northern Ireland Curriculum is also un­ dergoing a period of review. Any changes will be im­ plemented from 2002. The teaching profession in England and Wales is cur­ rently being reformed. Initiatives include leadership training for heads and deputy heads, the introduction of performance related pay, and an accelerated (fast track) career development scheme for teachers. The Learning and Skills Bill, currently before the UK Parliament, proposes major reform of further educa­ tion administration in England and Wales. Organiza­ tions currently responsible for post­16 learning will be replaced by two new bodies, the Learning and Skills Council for England (LSC) and the National Council for Education and Training for Wales (CETW). These orga­ nizations will be responsible for the planning and funding of all post­16 education and training (up to higher education). Current issues in Scottish education The Scottish Executive has set up an independent com­ mittee of inquiry into the professional conditions of service for teachers. The committee launched a wide­ ranging consultation exercise and has sought com­ ments on key issues including pay, promotion, manage­ ment structures, working hours and workload. It is due to report in May 2000. The Scottish Executive will create a new framework for the continuing professional development of teachers. A ministerial committee will be established to draw up a strategy for the continuing professional development of teachers in the school sector. This committee will meet for the first time early in 2000. The Scottish Executive has agreed to new arrange­ ments for the funding of higher and further education in Scotland. The measures proposed include the aboli­ tion of tuition fees for all Scottish higher and further education students in Scotland, the targeting of pay­ ments to students from lower income families and a graduate endowment plan which will allow students to make a deferred contribution. In January 2000 the Scottish Executive published The Standards in Scotland's Schools Bill. The Bill will put in ; the place a framework for improvement that gives Scottish Executive new powers to set the strategic di­ rection for education in Scotland. The Bill will include a duty on Scottish ministers and local authorities to promote improvements and a new improvement framework to ensure the Scottish Executive, local au­ thorities and schools work together. The Bill includes measures relating to the Scottish Executive, local au­ thorities, teachers, parents and pupils. In addition the Scottish Executive also has current priorities in the areas of pre­school education, New Community Schools, an Early Intervention Pro­ gramme, target setting, 5­14 curriculum review, ICT (information and communication technology) in schools, modern language teaching in schools and lifelong learning. ■ The contributions above have been provided by the na­ tional units concerned in the Eurydice network.

Europe is increasingly present in our day­to­day lives. The single currency, public health issues, consumer protection and many other matters mean that more and more people are asking questions about the European Union, its policies and its institutions. European information: a strategy of decentralization Most Europeans want to be better informed on issues such as the euro, citizens' rights and employment.' The media are in the front line in meeting this demand. Tele­ vision, newspapers and radio all report on Community events on a day­to­day basis: 60% of people say they get their information on Europe primarily from television, 41% from the papers, and 24% from the radio. But this information is not always enough. Two in three Euro­ peans say they want to know more. Which means there is a need to supplement their knowledge. But where and how? To meet this demand, the European Commission helps set up various instruments permitting increased decentral­ ization of information. Hence the several hundred "in­ formation relays" operating in partnership with the local authorities throughout the Member States at national, regional and local level. These are decentralized struc­ tures, close to the user, which aim to provide access to in­ formation on the EU when and where the citizen needs •it. These information relays take different forms. They es­ sentially consists of the Info­Points Europe scattered throughout the towns and regions in the 15 Member States, Rural Information and Promotion Carrefours which are more concerned with country areas, and larg­ er Information Centres. Info­Points: made­to­measure information in the towns and regions Since 1991, 121 Info­Points Europe (IPEs) have opened throughout the European Union. The initiative does not come from the European Commission but from local or regional authorities, public libraries or associations which want to open information centres in order to make European information more easily available to the public. Partnership agreements are concluded with the Commission which issues a common logo to all these IPEs, provides information in the appropriate languages and in various forms (books, brochures, CD­Roms, etc.), organizes training for the centre managers, and grants access to computer databases and Europe by Satellite, etc. This allows the Info­Points Europe to reply to re­ quests for general information, provide reference copies of certain official EU publications such as the Official Journal, and also organize interactive conferences and video screenings, etc. They are designed to be part of the fabric of the local community and thus able to select and adapt information to the real needs of their public. In addition to disseminating information, the Info­Points also try to adopt a more active approach. In Strasbourg (France) for example, the town halls have asked their lo­ cal Info­Point Europe to lay on complete training pro­ grammes. Others, such as the Info­Point in Tornio, Fin­ land, hold information days on Europe aimed at the general public or specific groups (students, teachers, etc.). Others again organize conferences, information visits and stands at cultural or trade fairs. Several IPEs ­ Toulouse, Linz and Modena, for example ­ have taken the initiative of hiring buses painted in the European colours which travel their region bringing information virtually to the citizen's doorstep. Rural areas want to be informed too In rural areas, the Commission launched the Rural Infor­ mation and Promotion Carrefours in 1988. The aim is to bring European information to the heart of rural com­ munities and promote meetings, discussions and actions through established regional bodies (chambers of agri­ culture, rural foundations, etc.). Rural areas are known to be very much concerned by the European Union as agri­ cultural policy has been almost entirely a Community re­ sponsibility since the EU was first founded. That said, the Carrefours do not limit their field of action to aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy alone. They also meet a wider need to inform the socio­economic players and the general public about the EU and Community measures and policies of interest to rural areas, to stimulate dia­ logue and cooperation, encourage exchanges of experi­ ence, etc. Some of the 122 Carrefours now operating have decided to publish newsletters or circulate publications, while others cooperate with the local media (television, re­ gional newspapers, etc.) or organize training sessions, seminars and conferences. known as Information Centres on Europe. The name of the Paris centre is Sources d'Europe and it occupies 4,300 m 2 premises in the base of the Grande Arche at La Défense. In Portugal, the Jacques Delors Information Centre is also located in the capital, Lisbon. These two centres, and soon also the one in Rome, provide reference documentation covering the whole field of Community activity. They are the product of a partnership between the French, Portuguese and Italian governments and the Commission and are invaluable centres for disseminating information and organizing special events in response to the tens of thousands of requests and visits made each year. Two­way information flow The Commission's communication and information strat­ egy thus employs a range of mutually complementary projects. The decentralized information relays and net­ works reach citizens seeking local access to information on the European Union, providing them with direct an­ swers to their questions and the opportunity to be ac­ tively involved in the process of European integration by initiating a dialogue and communicating their reactions to and comments on Community policies. This strategy is not confined to information networks alone. It is also reflected in the many initiatives for small and medium­sized enterprises and craft businesses (Euro Info Centres) and consumers (European Consumer Infor­ mation Centres). Mention must also be made of the vast amount of information available on the Europa Internet site (http://europa.eu.int/index.htm). ■ 1 According to Eurobarometer surveys (March 1999), 21% of people say they have a real need to know more about the EU, 44% would like to have more information and 32% are satisfied with what they know al­ ready. At national level: the information centres In addition to this local and regional information, more recently national centres have opened in Paris and Lis­ bon, with another to open shortly in Rome.

Over the past few years a new voice has been making itself heard in the European debate. A voice expressing the concerns of the majority of citizens on subjects such as the fight against unemployment, protection of the environment, aid to developing countries, and combating social exclusion and poverty. Europe listens to civil society The voice is that of organized civil society which rep­ resents thousands of associations and non­govern­ mental organizations (NGOs) throughout Europe. So what is this civil society and what does it stand for? It is not easy to define. But it is true to say that, in gen­ eral terms, it covers diverse elements such as non­ profit­making organizations, non­governmental or­ ganizations, the trade union movement and the various agencies often set up at European level and active in areas such as the fight against poverty, pro­ motion of the environment, support for development projects in Europe and the Third World. Its principal characteristics are that it is independent of govern­ ments, public authorities and political parties, and does not defend commercial interests or pursue prof­ it objectives. This emerging player is taking an active part in the Eu­ ropean debate by expressing its views and demands on topical issues. At negotiations on the Lomé Convention between the European Union and the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries, development organi­ zations made their position very clear, for example. Similarly, the implementation of European policy to combat discrimination is actively monitored and com­ mented on by associations engaged in combating so­ cial exclusion. Trade union organizations voice their opinions on European employment strategy; youth or­ ganizations call to account the Community institu­ tions; associations of the aged and/or disabled people press home their demands. Strengthening the partnership To the extent that civil society expresses the concerns of the citizen, it is important to listen to its demands and to be able to engage in constructive debate with it. A partnership between the European Commission and non­governmental organizations has been developing over the past 20 years on a number of fronts. Initiatives have been taken in favour of civil society and the European Commission has set up a new "Citi­ zenship and Youth" Directorate within the Education and Culture Directorate­General. The Commission also promotes information and reflection actions on the part of the various partners in civil society in the framework of its calls for proposals. An annual call for proposals is aimed at financing in­ formation and communication projects on European topics by non­governmental organizations. Seminars, conferences, publications, computer products, radio and television broadcasts and European networks are all examples of actions which can be funded in this way. Among the main themes this year are the Euro­ pean Union and its objectives and institutions, Agenda 2000, the intergovernmental conference, and Euro­ pean citizenship. A second call for proposals is published once a year to stimulate reflection actions on European integration. In this framework, the Commission finances a series of small­scale projects based on priority subjects agreed at the start of each year. Subjects for the year 2000 are the charter of fundamental rights, the ethical values and sources of European integration, and the meeting of different cultures. In addition, a partnership with trade union organiza­ tions makes it possible to hold regular meetings with the European trade union press, for example. Every year several dozen trade unions also receive funding to or­ ganize training seminars. The aim of the Infonet site is to inform and dialogue with the various players in civil society.

I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) OPINIONS EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE 461ST PLENARY SESSION HELD ON 17 AND 18 MARCH 2010 Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on ‘The roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010) and follow-up strategy’ (2010/C 354/01) Rapporteur: Laura GONZÁLEZ DE TXABARRI ETXANIZ In a letter dated 25 September 2009, the Vice-President of the European Commission Margot Wallström asked the European Economic and Social Committee to draw up, under Article 262 of the Treaty estab­ lishing the European Community, an exploratory opinion on The roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010) and follow-up strategy. The Section for Employment, Social Affairs and Citizenship, which was responsible for the Committee's work on the subject, adopted its opinion on 23 February 2010. At its 461st plenary session, held on 17 and 18 March 2010 (meeting of 17 March), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 137 votes to three, with five abstentions. 1. Recommendations 1.1 In addition to being an aim in itself, equality between women and men is a prerequisite for meeting the EU's aims for growth, employment and social cohesion. 1.2 The Mid-term assessment of the roadmap for equality is taking place at a time of economic crisis. It is important to note the impact and consequences of this crisis on women and men, given their different positions in society. 1.3 Equality should be mainstreamed into all policies, especially social and employment policies, and efforts should be furthered to remove barriers preventing women and men from participating fully and equally in the labour market. 1.4 To ensure and improve women's financial independence, both the quantity and the quality of female employment should be improved, including support for the self-employed. The risk faced by women of falling into a precarious situation must be addressed and a fair distribution of family and domestic respon­ sibilities encouraged. 1.5 Unequal pay has structural causes: the undervaluing of skills traditionally viewed as female, occupational and sectoral segregation, precarious employment, breaks in working life, etc. Legislation and collective agreements are effective instruments for tackling the issue of unequal pay, with the need for all economic and social stakeholders to be involved. 1.6 The greater presence of women in business and political activities fosters equality, women's economic independence, victory over gender stereotypes and the promotion of women in the decision-making process. 1.7 Women are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion and poverty. Tailoring social rights to individual needs, a guar­ anteed minimum income and taking into account periods of inactivity and reduced working hours enabling women to take care of a relative/dependent are measures that improve social protection and lower the risk of people falling into poverty. EN 28.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 354/1 
1.8 Reconciling family life and work is crucial to achieving equality and improving jobs for women: high-quality public social services and improvements to existing maternity, paternity and parental leave. Progress needs to be made on all social stakeholders accepting responsibility for ensuring that household and caring tasks are fairly divided. 1.9 The EESC considers that the equal representation of women in decision-making must be promoted and that the Member States should, therefore, make a greater commitment, by setting clear goals and implementing effective measures such as positive action, equality plans, etc. 1.10 Given the persistence of gender-based violence and human trafficking, the Committee is of the view that current legislation should be enforced and national action plans should be drawn up, coordinated by a global European strategy, and that specific programmes in the field should be boosted. 1.11 To combat sexist stereotypes the EESC considers it is essential to educate society along non-sexist lines, offering training to both men and women, encouraging more women to study science and technology, attaching greater value to jobs traditionally viewed as ‘female’ and avoiding sexism in the media. 1.12 Use should be made of the EU's foreign and devel­ opment policy to promote women's rights on the international stage, improving their skills and empowerment. 1.13 The EESC considers that gender analysis needs to be fully mainstreamed into all of the Commission's spheres of activity and should be recognised in European and national budgets. Staff trained in equality issues will be needed to ensure this, in addition to indicators broken down by gender that help show the situation affecting women and men and assess the degree of compliance with the equality plan. 1.14 In the new equality strategy to be followed from 2010 the objectives cannot become mere recommendations from the Commission to the Member States. Instead, they should be binding directives with quantifiable objectives. Greater political involvement is therefore required at all levels. The EU insti­ tutions must lead by example, looking at a proactive review of work done and an impact assessment on implementation. 2. General comments 2.1 The Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010 demonstrates the European Commission's commitment, working together with the Member States, to making progress on equality. At the Commission's request, the EESC is carrying out a review of the roadmap for equality, studying the impact of the measures adopted and the extent to which they have been achieved, and is also making proposals for action for the new strategy in 2010. 2.2 The EESC acknowledges the EU's wide-reaching commitment to equality: the 1957 Treaty of Rome introduces the principle of equal pay, the 1999 Treaty of Amsterdam adopts a dual approach which combines a cross-sectoral method with specific measures and the Treaty of Lisbon gives an explicit commitment to eliminating inequalities and promoting equality. 2.3 At the international level, the EU has signed up to the Beijing Platform for Action, the Millennium Goals, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which places women firmly at the centre of human rights concerns. 2.4 Despite this broad regulatory framework, the stated aims have not been achieved and inequality between women and men is still a reality. No significant progress has been made in any of the six priority areas for political action set out in the roadmap for equality between women and men (2006- 2010). In light of this, real political will to make change has to be questioned. Incorporating the principle of gender equality, which is a key factor for competitiveness and growth, should be a priority for the EU's new 2020 Action Strategy. 2.5 The evaluation of the roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010) is being carried out during an economic downturn, and the implications of the crisis for women need to be studied, given their different position in the labour market and in public social spending policies, especially those concerning social services, which are the policies that most affect women. 2.6 The crisis has affected in the first place sectors trad- itionally occupied by men, such as construction, transport and industry, and has subsequently spread to other sectors where a larger proportion of women work (banking services and the commercial sector for example). In many families the women's salary thus becomes the only source of income, which is generally lower than men's because women tend mostly to be employed in the service sector, on part-time or temporary contracts, or in the hidden economy. All of these factors in turn have a detrimental effect on the national economy, as they inhibit private consumption and thus slow down recovery. 2.7 The crisis also has an effect on social policies; women receive fewer unemployment benefits in terms of both amount and duration, due to their often weaker position in the labour market. Furthermore, basic public services such as healthcare, education and social services in general provide less coverage just when families, and especially women, need it most. As these are also sectors in which the female workforce is concen­ trated, this will again have a knock-on effect on women's employment. EN C 354/2 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2010 
2.8 Measures to combat the crisis cannot be gender-neutral and where necessary, the new policies to achieve economic recovery and the current Structural Funds programmes must take account of the different positions that men and women occupy in society. 2.9 Equality should be a priority, not only in order to address the current crisis and the longer-term recovery, but also to deal with the demographic and economic challenges that affect the European social model and that have an impact on women and their financial independence. 3. Specific comments – Part I: Priority Areas of Action for Gender Equality The 2006-2010 Roadmap for equality outlines the commitments and measures deemed necessary to make progress on equality and to eliminate inequalities. The first part of the plan sets out six priority areas for political action, with their corresponding indicators: 1. Achieving equal economic independence for women and men 2. Reconciling work with private and family life 3. Promoting equal participation of women and men in decision-making 4. Eradicating all forms of gender-based violence 5. Eliminating sexist stereotypes 6. Promoting gender equality in external and development policies. The second part focuses on improving governance. 3.1 Achieving equal economic independence for women and men 3.1.1 R e a c h i n g t h e L i s b o n e m p l o y m e n t t a r g e t s 3.1.1.1 Many countries are still failing to meet the Lisbon Strategy's target of having 60 % of women in employment. While 70,9 % of men are employed, only 58,8 % of women are in employment ( 1 ), and in the over-55 age bracket, 36,8 % of women are employed compared with 55 % of men. Women are more likely to be unemployed, but the gap is decreasing as the economic crisis develops (9,8 % in comparison to 9,6 % of men). 3.1.1.2 There is a need to improve both the number of jobs available to women and the quality of these jobs, as women are over-represented in low-paid sectors and in jobs that are more likely to be precarious. Part-time work is predominantly feminine (31,5 % women compared with 8,3 % men) and 14,3 % of female employees are employed on a temporary contract. Furthermore, when women are also mothers, their rate of employment falls by more than 10 percentage points which reflects the unequal distribution of family tasks and the insufficient care infrastructure. 3.1.1.3 The EESC recommends making a joint study of women's unemployment rates and the rate of women's in- activity for family reasons ( 2 ). Due to their role as carers, women often do not meet the criteria to be considered ‘unem­ ployed’, with inactivity thus becoming a form of hidden unem­ ployment. 3.1.1.4 A multidisciplinary approach is required, as this would help supplement employment policies with educational and social measures, a form of education that eradicates stereotypes in employment, high-quality public social services that guarantee care for dependent persons and campaigns to raise awareness about the division of domestic work between women and men. 3.1.1.5 The Commission should include and promote equality in all its programmes (as it does with the PROGRESS programme. The Structural Funds provide the ideal framework; they help to provide information on how countries are achieving this goal, carry out an annual assessment of the gender impact of such measures by country and also to establish appropriate measures and penalties for countries which do not ensure the quantity and quality of jobs for women. 3.1.2 E l i m i n a t i n g t h e g e n d e r p a y g a p 3.1.2.1 Achieving wage parity is crucial to achieving equality but despite the advances made in legislation, the pay gap between women and men has gone up to 17,4 %, and is as high as 30 % for women over 50. 3.1.2.2 The wage gap is structural in origin: segregation into undervalued economic sectors and low-paid professions, a greater presence in the hidden economy and in precarious jobs, and career breaks or working fewer hours for family reasons are factors which all have detrimental effects on women's salaries. 3.1.2.3 The EESC ( 3 ) recommends that each Member State scrutinises its legislation on contract conditions and pay in order to avoid direct and indirect discrimination against women.

( 2 ) The rate of inactivity on the grounds of providing family care (children or dependents) for women between 25 and 54 stands at 25,1 %, compared with only 2,4 % for men. 19,2 % of women, compared to 2,9 % of men are inactive due to other family respon­ sibilities (Source: LFS, Eurostat, 2008). ( 3 ) OJ C 211, 19.8.2008, p. 54. 
3.1.2.4 Legislation should incorporate control mechanisms that will detect gender discrimination, promoting transparent job classification systems so that the qualifications, experience and potential of all staff are valued and rewarded equally. 3.1.2.5 Collective bargaining is a useful tool for incorp­ orating non-sexist criteria for rating jobs, training leave for women’s career advancement, career breaks and special leave for family reasons, flexible working hours, etc. that reduce differences in salaries. 3.1.3 W o m e n e n t r e p r e n e u r s 3.1.3.1 Despite being highly qualified, women still form the minority in management positions within companies. The Commission has promoted equality in the framework of Corporate Social Responsibility, increased State aid for women’s start-ups (Regulation (EC) No 800/2008), and has given its support to the European Network to promote Women's Entrepreneurship. In addition to governments and official bodies, this network should involve relevant civil society organisations with a view to benefiting from the exchange of experiences and good practices. 3.1.3.2 It is suggested that the recommendations of the EU Entrepreneurship Action Plan on increasing women's start-ups be implemented through measures such as providing better access to finance and credit, developing entrepreneurial networks that provide organisational and advisory services, appropriate vocational training and re-training, promote good practices, etc. 3.1.4 G e n d e r e q u a l i t y i n s o c i a l p r o t e c t i o n a n d t h e f i g h t a g a i n s t p o v e r t y 3.1.4.1 Women are especially vulnerable to social exclusion and poverty. Women's unequal position in the labour market and their dependency on social protection systems are factors that contribute to this situation. 3.1.4.2 Conditions of access to social protection should be made the same for women and men. Shorter working days for family reasons, the use of maternity and/or parental leave to look after children, part-time or temporary work, segregation and wage discrimination are factors that reduce the amount and duration of the future social benefits received by women, especially as regards unemployment benefits and retirement pensions. To mitigate this situation partially, measures should include recognising time spent carrying out unpaid work, working shorter hours and stopping work for family reasons as fully paid up tax periods. 3.1.4.3 Public social protection should guarantee a decent minimum income that reduces the risk of poverty by focussing in particular on elderly women, widows who are in receipt of a derivative pension, and single-parent families headed by women. 3.1.4.4 Special attention should be paid to the private pension schemes established in some countries, since future pensions are determined by individuals’ income and life expectancy, which penalises women in particular. 3.1.4.5 2010 is the European Year for combating poverty and social exclusion, and also marks the end of the Lisbon Strategy and the implementation period for the Open Method of Coordination. The EU's new 2020 Strategy should set specific objectives and measures that are more effective in both the short and long terms, to combat poverty, especially poverty affecting women. 3.1.5 T h e g e n d e r d i m e n s i o n i n h e a l t h 3.1.5.1 The EESC considers that a new health strategy is needed which takes account of the different health requirements of men and women, but points out that no tangible measures have been provided for to achieve this. Further work is therefore needed on researching women's health and the illnesses affecting them. 3.1.5.2 The ageing population coupled with women's partici­ pation in the job market will increase the demand for long-term care services in future. The Member States should guarantee high-quality public health and social services: the lack of such coverage has a particularly negative impact on women, as they are primarily responsible for providing care. 3.1.6 C o m b a t i n g m u l t i p l e d i s c r i m i n a t i o n , i n p a r t i c u l a r a g a i n s t i m m i g r a n t a n d e t h n i c m i n o r i t y w o m e n 3.1.6.1 The EESC reiterates the need to mainstream the gender perspective into migration and asylum policy. Closer attention should be paid to immigrant women and women from ethnic minorities, as they suffer the greatest inequalities and are in a particularly vulnerable position, especially given the current economic crisis ( 4 ). 3.1.6.2 The increasing number of women migrants is directly linked to the demand for workers in the domestic and care work sectors, due largely to the lack of social infrastructure. Significant numbers of women immigrants are employed in sectors where casual and precarious jobs are typical. There is a need to ‘professionalise’ and regularise these jobs, and promote professional qualifications to ensure women immigrants are better incorporated into the job market. 3.2 Reconciling work with private and family life 3.2.1 Where women's employment is concerned, the targets set in the Lisbon Strategy have been reached, despite the failure to meet the Barcelona Objectives for childcare facilities (33 % coverage for children under the age of 3 and 90 % for children aged between 3 and 6). A care service infrastructure is essential, with available places and a flexible range of services that guar­ antees a tailored, high-quality approach: arrangements for EN C 354/4 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2010 ( 4 ) See the opinions in OJ C 182, 4.8.2009, p. 19 and OJ C 27, 3.2.2009, p. 95. 
out-of-hours and holiday periods, canteens and specialist centres to cater for different degrees of dependency. Investment in social services not only has positive effects on the economy and especially employment; it is also of great social benefit. 3.2.2 Caring for children and dependent persons requires flexible working hours and working time thus needs to be reorganised to meet people's family and work requirements and also to be equally accessible to women and men. 3.2.3 Many women use part-time work as a means of recon­ ciling working life and family life, partly due to the lack of care facilities. The increasing proportion of women in part-time work, however, is due not only to family obligations but is also in many cases the only way in which women can access the labour market ( 5 ). 3.2.4 As regards leave, the individual rights of men and women should be put on an equal footing, regardless of the type of employment contract they have (freelance, temporary or open-ended contract for example). The EESC therefore welcomes the agreement reached between ETUC, Business­ europe, CEEP and UEAPME to extend parental leave ( 6 ), although it deems it crucial to continue working towards full equality. The EESC welcomes the Commission's initiative to improve protection for workers who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding and agrees that paid maternity leave of at least 18 weeks should be guaranteed ( 7 ). 3.2.5 A clear commitment should be given to ensuring that all social stakeholders share responsibility for domestic work and care, which in the main is carried out by women, and thus ensure that the best use is made of all human capital. A campaign is needed to encourage households to share domestic work and caring (one cause of inequality), as is a re-assessment of this type of work. 3.3 Promoting equal participation of women and men in decision- making 3.3.1 A firmer commitment is required to achieve gender equality in the decision-making process ( 8 ) in the economic, political, scientific and technological spheres. The situation facing women has barely changed in recent years. Clear targets should therefore be set, with deadlines for achieving them, in addition to specific policies and effective measures (such as positive action, equality plans, specific training, participation quotas, awareness-raising campaigns, etc.). 3.3.2 Ensuring men and women are on an equal footing in politics should be a cornerstone for building Europe. In the elections of June 2009, women held 35 % of seats in the European Parliament; 10 Members of the Commission are female, whilst 17 are male. Women hold 24 % of seats in national parliaments and 25 % of ministerial portfolios in national governments ( 9 ). At the EESC, 23,6 % of current Members are women, whilst 76,4 % are men, and in senior management posts (directors, deputy directors, deputy secretaries-general) women account for only 16,7 %, whilst the figure is 83,3 % for men. Equal representation between men and women should be a top priority for achieving equality at all levels. 3.3.3 Progress has been slow in the field of public sector research (39 % of posts are held by women), and only minor improvements have been seen in the economic and financial sectors (no directors of central banks are women and only 17 % of central bank board members are female) with the figure being barely 3 % for the boards of management of major companies. 3.4 Eradicating gender-based violence and trafficking in human beings 3.4.1 Violence against women and girls remains a serious problem. This is a global and systemic phenomenon, taking many different forms and shapes. Like the Commission, the EESC is extremely concerned at the number of women who suffer violence, the scale of trafficking in women and pros­ titution, especially among immigrants and the persistence of acts of violence committed under the cloak of traditions and religion ( 10 ). 3.4.2 The appropriate social, economic and legal measures need to be used to reduce and eliminate the various factors that foster violence against women, such as a lack of material resources, financial dependence, low levels of education, persistent gender stereotypes, and difficulties in accessing the job market. 3.4.3 Women immigrants require particular support as they are more vulnerable, either due to their irregular situation or because they are isolated from their social surroundings. The language barrier, social and cultural differences, or simply not knowing about the support structures in place, sometimes prevent them from asking for help when they are victims of domestic violence. The situation is worse still for undocumented immigrant women: specific measures should be put in place so that the obstacles these women face can be removed and their rights guaranteed. EN 28.12.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 354/5 ( 5 ) In 2008, in the EU, 31,5 % of women in employment held a part- time job, as opposed to 8,3 % of men. 27,54 % of women in part- time jobs claimed that this was because they were the carers, either for young children or older dependents and 29,2 % because they could not find a full-time job (compared with 3,3 % and 22,7 % of men respectively).

3.4.4 Specific programmes are required (as well as continuing with those already in place, such as Daphne) to prevent and combat violence against women. Funding for these programmes should be increased. National action plans should be drawn up as part of a strategy coordinated at European level, containing both practical measures and deadlines to ensure that they will be properly implemented. It must be a priority for Member States to enforce current legal frameworks regarding domestic violence prevention and the protection of victims and those at risk, including children. Add- itionally, indicators are needed to provide a detailed picture of all aspects of gender-based violence, including sexual harassment and people-trafficking. Statistics harmonised at the EU level are essential to monitor and assess developments in this field. 3.4.5 Given the worrying number of violent acts among young people, including gender-related violence, the Committee welcomes the Commission's timely decision to include the fight against gender violence in the projects forming part of the ‘Youth in action’ programme. There is also a need however to incorporate a culture of non-violence and respect for the rights of all people into all education and training programmes for children and young people. 3.5 Eliminating sexist stereotypes in society 3.5.1 Sexist stereotypes are cultural and social views which assume that there are ‘male’ or ‘female’ roles and tasks. These stereotypes have an impact on training and job options and lead to segregation in the job market. Stereotypes make it harder to achieve equality and the full participation of women and men in the decision-making process. 3.5.2 Despite the high educational levels they attain, women are still concentrated in economic sectors (healthcare and social work, teaching, the commercial sector, public administration, business services, hotels and restaurants, etc.) and professions that have traditionally been viewed as ‘female’ (sales assistants, domestic help, care providers, as administrative staff, etc.), on the lowest rungs of the career ladder, with little potential for moving up to better positions. This segregation has remained almost unchanged over the past few years, because the increase in the number of women in employment has taken place in sectors that are already dominated by women. 3.5.3 In order to combat gender stereotypes, there is a need to: — Educate children and young people using non-sexist role models, especially by monitoring educational material and teachers that promote these stereotypes. The EESC would welcome the inclusion of gender equality as a specific priority in EU education and training programmes. — Promote the presence of women in scientific and tech­ nological education, where they are under-represented, thereby enabling them to access better jobs, and improving the balance between men and women in all areas of knowledge;. — Encourage entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity amongst women in all sectors, self-employed, employees and the unemployed. as an important tool to highlight the strengths women bring to society. — Ensure that women are able to participate in the labour market on an equal footing, especially when they are mothers and have dependent minors. — Value the work done by women, especially in the field of caring, promoting ongoing training. — Eradicate sexist stereotypes from the media and the adver­ tising industry, paying particular attention to the portrayal of violence and degrading images of women. — Increase the number of women in decision-making positions in the media in order to promote non-discriminatory treatment and a realistic vision of women and men in society. 3.6 Promoting gender equality outside the EU 3.6.1 The Commission should continue to promote women's rights at the international level through its foreign and devel­ opment policies. The gender dimension should be included in all aspects of cooperation, with specific measures for women, promoting their involvement in decision-making processes and their sense of initiative, and the capacity of developing countries to take on the task of promoting equality should be boosted. 3.6.2 The gender dimension should form part of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), for action in crisis situations. In the field of humanitarian aid (ECHO), the Commission should pay particular attention to women with children or dependent relatives in the event of natural disasters and to women who have suffered violence at the hands of men in times of upheaval. 4. Part II: Improving governance to incorporate gender equality 4.1 Gender analysis should be mainstreamed into all of the Commission's spheres of action, including the budget, and the progress on equality within its own walls should be assessed. This would require staff to be trained in gender equality and robust disaggregated indicators that would give an accurate picture of women's situation. 4.2 The Commission should hold open and ongoing talks with women's organisations, the social partners and other civil society organisations to gain a better understanding of problems relating to inequality. EN C 354/6 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2010 
4.3 The EESC calls on the Commission to urge all of its units to use non-sexist language in all documents, in official texts, in interpreting into all languages and on its web pages. 5. Part III. Follow-up strategies for 2010 onwards At the Commission’s request, the EESC is developing a series of proposals regarding the new Roadmap for equality to be implemented from 2010 onwards. 5.1 A global approach should be used to tackle equality between women and men. EU policies should aim not only to strengthen the involvement of women in all spheres, deal with demographic challenges and improve children’s wellbeing for example. Measures should rather focus explicitly on reducing the lack of equality in the distribution of family, care and domestic responsibilities between men and women specifically, and more generally between all social stakeholders. 5.2 The Commission should ensure gender equality is main­ streamed across all sectors as a priority across all its areas, units, measures, policies and directorates. Gender is not an issue of concern only to the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs. 5.3 Specialists in gender issues are needed who can provide the training and materials required to raise awareness and increase the knowledge and skills of European staff about equality. Eurostat must continue to break statistics down by gender, improving existing methodologies and incorporating new indicators that provide better information on the situation facing women and thus give a comprehensive overview of the situation in the EU. 5.4 The gender perspective should be recognised in European and national budgets. Studies are also necessary to assess the impact of public measures relating to gender. 5.5 The Structural Funds offer an ideal framework for the Member States to include gender equality in their operational programmes and in the different stages of the fund's implemen­ tation, with the assessment of the gender impact in each priority policy area or sphere of activity of these programmes. Better coordination and collaboration is required between the Structural Funds and the bodies responsible for equality in each country in order to achieve better results. 5.6 The Commission should ensure the legislation is complied with, providing examples of good practice and sanc­ tioning Member States that fail to respect the principle of equality between women and men. Gender equality must be overseen and assessed in all policies and in all departments. An evaluation method is required that enables the level of compliance with the established objectives to be noted and rated, together with achievements and any backward steps. An evaluation unit should be set up that supervises and assesses the actions of the different Member States in a systematic way using the indicators set out in the roadmap for equality. 5.7 If amendments are made to the future roadmap, the Committee would recommend adapting area 1. This area needs to be subdivided as it covers a variety of different issues (employment, health, immigration), and different methods are therefore required to tackle them. It would also be useful to develop a new area for ‘women and the environment’, because women play a fundamental role in sustainable development, given their particular concern for ensuring the quality and sustainability of life for current and future generations ( 11 ). 5.8 The EESC wishes to emphasise the important role placed by the social partners in promoting equality through social dialogue and collective bargaining. One good example of this is the 2005 framework strategy on gender equality. 5.9 The European Institute for Equality should play a key role in improving governance and revising current legislation on raising awareness and equality. The institute should monitor and guarantee that all policies include and promote equality, and foster the involvement of Europeans in a more responsible and more inclusive gender policy. 5.10 Europe's economic and financial problems and demo­ graphic changes should not affect the goal of equality and should not be used as an excuse to relegate it to second place.

III (Preparatory acts) COUNCIL POSITION (EU) No 3/2012 OF THE COUNCIL AT FIRST READING with a view to adoption of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union Adopted by the Council on 23 January 2012 (2012/C 38 E/01) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organi­ sations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community ( 4 ), which was subsequently repealed and integrated into Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ( 5 ), has provided a reliable scheme for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons of the Union (food distribution scheme) for more than two decades and has positively contributed to the social cohesion of the Union by reducing economic and social disparities. (2) The objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as defined in Article 39(1) of the Treaty include stabi­ lising markets and ensuring that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices. Over the years, the food distribution scheme has underpinned the fulfilment of both objectives and, by reducing the food insecurity of the most deprived persons in the Union, has proved to be an essential tool contributing to guaranting the broad availability of food within the Union while reducing intervention stocks. (3) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 7 July 2011, called on the Commission and the Council to develop a transitional solution for the remaining years of the current multi-annual financial framework so as to avoid a sharp cutback in food aid as a result of the reduction in funding from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million and so as to ensure that people who are dependent on food aid do not suffer from food poverty.

(4) The current food distribution scheme relies on the distribution of products from Union intervention stocks, supplemented on a temporary basis by purchases on the market. However, successive reforms of the CAP and favourable developments in producer prices have resulted in a progressive reduction in inter­ vention stocks, and in the range of products available. The current version of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 only allows market purchases in the case of temporary unavailability of products. In the light of the judgment of the General Court in Case T-576/08 ( 1 ), purchases of food on the Union market cannot replace the reduced intervention stocks on a regular basis. In these circum­ stances, it appears appropriate to end the food distribution scheme. In order to give charity organi­ sations in Member States that are using the current food distribution scheme sufficient time to adapt to the new situation, the food distribution scheme should be amended to provide for a phasing-out period during which market purchases should become a regular source of supply for the food distribution scheme in order to complement intervention stocks, where suitable intervention stocks are not available. The phasing-out period should end on the completion of the 2013 annual plan. (5) The Union's food distribution scheme should apply without prejudice to any national food distribution schemes. (6) In order to ensure sound budgetary management, it is necessary to lay down a fixed ceiling for Union aid. The food distribution scheme should be added to the list of expenditure in Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy ( 2 ) to be financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF). (7) Experience has shown that certain improvements in the management of the food distribution scheme are necessary. The Commission should therefore establish annual plans for the implementation of the food distribution scheme in 2012 and 2013 based on requests by Member States that have been communicated to the Commission and on other information considered to be relevant. Member States should base their requests for food products on national food distribution programmes setting out their objectives and priorities for food distribution to the most deprived persons, which should include nutritional considerations. In this context, it is appropriate that Member States have the option of giving preference to products of Union origin. Finally, in order to secure a proper coverage of costs linked to the implementation of the annual plans, it is necessary for Member States to be given the option to reimburse, within the resources made available through the annual plans, certain costs incurred by designated organisations in relation to administration, transport and storage. (8) Member States should undertake adequate administrative and physical controls and provide penalties in the case of irregularities in order to ensure that the annual plans are implemented in accordance with the applicable rules. (9) In order to ensure the continuing operation of the current food distribution scheme enabling it to be phased-out in an efficient manner, this Regulation should apply as from 1 January 2012 and until the completion of the 2013 annual plan. (10) Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 In Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the following point is added: ‘(g) the scheme for the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Union provided for in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.’. Article 2 Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is amended as follows: (1) Article 27 is replaced by the following: ‘Article 27 Scheme for the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Union 1. A scheme is established for 2012 and 2013 whereby food products may be distributed to the most deprived persons in the Union through organisations, which shall not be commercial undertakings, designated by Member States. For the purpose of this food distribution scheme, products in intervention stocks shall be made available or, where there are no intervention stocks suitable for the food distribution scheme, food products shall be purchased on the market. For the purposes of the food distribution scheme provided for in the first subparagraph ‘most deprived persons’ means physical persons, including families or groups composed of such persons, who are recorded or recognised on the basis of eligibility criteria adopted by the national competent authorities to be socially and financially dependent, or who are judged to be so on the basis of the criteria used by the designated organisations and approved by those national competent authorities.

2. Member States wishing to participate in the food distribution scheme provided for in paragraph 1 shall submit, to the Commission, food distribution programmes containing the following: (a) details of the main characteristics and objectives of such programmes, (b) the organisations designated, (c) the requests for quantities of food products to be distributed each year and other relevant information. Member States shall choose the food products on the basis of objective criteria including nutritional values and suit­ ability for distribution. For that purpose, Member States may give preference to food products of Union origin. 3. The Commission shall adopt annual plans based on the requests and other relevant information referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 and submitted by Member States as part of their food distribution programmes,. Each annual plan shall set out annual financial allocations by the Union per Member State. When food products included in the annual plan are not available in intervention stocks in the Member State where such products are required, the Commission shall make provision in the annual plan for the transfer of those products to that Member State from Member States where they are available in intervention stocks. The Commission may revise an annual plan in the light of any relevant developments affecting its execution. 4. The food products shall be released to designated organisations free of charge. The distribution of the food products to the most deprived persons shall be: (a) free of charge, or (b) at a price which is in no case greater than that justified by the costs incurred by the designated organisations in their distribution and that are not eligiblecosts under points (a) and (b) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 7. 5. Member States participating in the food distribution scheme provided for in paragraph 1 shall: (a) submit to the Commission an annual report on imple­ mentation of the food distribution programmes; (b) keep the Commission informed in a timely manner on developments affecting the implementation of the food distribution programmes. 6. The Union shall finance the eligible costs under the scheme. This financing shall not exceed EUR 500 million per budget year. 7. The eligible costs under the scheme shall be: (a) the cost of food products released from intervention stocks, (b) the cost of food products purchased on the market, and (c) the costs of transporting food products in intervention stocks between Member States. Within the financial resources available to implement the annual plans in each Member State, the national competent authorities may consider to be eligible the following costs: (a) costs of transport of food products to the storage depots of the designated organisations; (b) the following costs incurred by the designated organi­ sations, to the extent that they are directly linked with the implementation of the annual plans: (i) administrative costs; (ii) transport costs between the storage depots of the designated organisations and the points of final distribution, and (iii) storage costs. 8. Member States shall carry out administrative and physical controls to ensure that the annual plans are imple­ mented in compliance with the applicable rules and shall establish the penalties applicable in cases of irregularities. 9. The words ‘European Union’ aid accompanied by the emblem of the European Union shall be clearly marked in the packing of food distributed through the annual plans as well as in the distribution points. 10. The food distribution scheme provided for in paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to any national schemes, whereby food products are distributed to most deprived persons, that are in conformity with Union law.’.

STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS I. INTRODUCTION On 25 September 2008, the Commission submitted a proposal ( 1 ) to the Council on the above issue. The European Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading on 26 March 2009. On 17 September 2010, the Commission presented an amended proposal ( 2 ). On 3 October 2011, the Commission submitted a new amended proposal ( 3 ) replacing the previous one. The Economic and Social Committee delivered its opinion on 7 December 2011. On 15 December 2011, the Council reached a political agreement on the text of the proposal. II. OBJECTIVES The scheme was originally established in 1987, allowing Member States to release public stocks of surplus food for use as food aid. Since then, the situation has changed (intervention stocks are almost non-existent) which led the Commission in 2008 to adopt a proposal to allow food purchases on the open market on a permanent basis. The main elements of that proposal were the introduction of national co-financing and of three-year distribution plans, and the eligibility of those products to which no intervention applied. The most recent amended proposal of October 2011 provides for the alignment of EU agricultural legislation with the Lisbon Treaty provisions on delegated and implementing acts and, furthermore, it provides 100 % EU funding with an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million, as well as reimbursement of storage costs to charities and the maintaining of the current annual plans. In addition, market purchases are made a regular source of supply for the programme to complement intervention stocks. III. ANALYSIS OF THE COUNCIL'S POSITION AT FIRST READING The Council's position confirms most of the amendments introduced by the Commission in the amended proposal and, therefore, takes into account all the European Parliament's substantial first- reading amendments. In particular, the Council accepts the European Parliament's view as regards full Union funding for the programme, the possibility of giving preference to food products of Union origin, and the notion that the transport, storage and administrative costs directly linked with the implementation of the scheme can be eligible. The Council's position also introduces some changes to the amended proposal not covered by the European Parliament's first-reading opinion, which referred to the first proposal from 2008: — it removes the additional legal basis proposed by the Commission on social cohesion (Article 175(3) of the TFEU); — it phases out the programme within the CAP by 31 December 2013; — it exceptionally removes the alignment provisions; and — it provides for retroactivity as from 1 January 2012.

Income from work after retirement in the EU The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policymaking with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research. The Foundation was established in 1975 by Council Regulation EEC No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975. 4 5 T J - 31 - 12 - 923 - E N - C It is increasingly common for workers in the EU to take up paid work after retirement. This trend adds an important dimension to the current discourse on extending working lives. Facilitating work after retirement for those who want to work can contribute to sustainable pension systems. This study investigates retirees’ motivations for seeking paid work and their opportunities for gaining employment. It examines the extent to which work after retirement is related to income adequacy among the retired population. It also explores the types of paid employment that retirees take up and identifies ways in which companies seek to recruit and retain retirees. The report concludes with recommendations for governments, employers and retirees. I n c o m e fr o m w o r k a ft e r r e t i r e m e n t i n t h e E U doi:10.2806/42416

1 Executive summary Introduction EU social and employment policies increasingly emphasise extending working life and increasing effective retirement age. Over the past few years, it has become more common for Europeans to work beyond the age at which they are entitled to a statutory or occupational pension. The employment rate among 65- to 69-year-olds increased from 8.8% in 2005 to 10.5% in 2011 – a remarkable development, especially in a time of economic crisis. In this European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, a special Eurobarometer reported that one-third of people wanted to continue working beyond the pension age, with 6 out of 10 thinking that people should be able to do so. This study investigates retirees’ motivations to take up paid work and how they relate to income adequacy. It explores who these working retirees are, characterises the work they are doing and concludes with lessons for policymakers and employers. Evidence comes from literature, analyses of EU databases and seven country studies. Policy context The European Commission’s 2012 White Paper on pensions highlights the challenges of demographic ageing for the sustainability of adequate pensions systems. Member States have been raising retirement ages and discouraging early retirement arrangements. Increased employment rates among people below and above the retirement age will have a positive impact on sustainability of pension systems. Key findings Since 2005, employment rates among people aged 65 and over have shown the largest increases in Finland, the UK, Lithuania, Germany and Austria. Motivational factors ■ Additional income is a motivation. For those retirees who work, it provides over half their income. ■ Around one-fifth work because of financial need. They tend to have low incomes and work under insecure conditions. ■ For most, motivation largely comes from other factors: work brings contact with colleagues and clients, learning and opportunities to contribute to society. Profile of working retirees ■ Working retirees are often younger and male. Retirees are more likely to work if they are highly educated, live in urban areas or have a mortgage. ■ Nevertheless, recent growth in employment rates has come from female retirees and retirees with a medium level of education in particular. ■ Among retirees who do not work, a significant proportion would like to work but cannot find suitable employment. Many were already disadvantaged in the labour market well before retirement. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 2 Employment contract ■ The majority work part time. ■ About half are self-employed; often, however, they work as a one-person enterprise for a single employer. ■ Almost one-fifth of working retirees have a temporary contract. This is higher than for other age groups and also more often reflects the worker’s preference. ■ Some carry out undeclared work. ■ Retirees work relatively often in the agriculture and fisheries sector and the professional, scientific and technical activities sector. Reasons for employing retirees ■ As society is ageing, retirees form an increasing proportion of an organisation’s client base. A workforce with retirees helps companies to understand these clients’ preferences and to relate to them. ■ Organisations appreciate that retirees are often open to accepting flexible work arrangements. ■ Cost savings result from postponing recruiting and training new employees. ■ Employers highlight a particularly high work motivation among retirees. Policy pointers Lessons for policymakers ■ Work after retirement can be enriching and rewarding, but promoting it may have negative impacts. It can be seen to erode the right to enjoy retirement; it risks marginalising people who might not be in a position to work or who contribute to society, for example, by caring and volunteering; and regardless of macro-level evidence pointing to the contrary, it conflicts with public perceptions that older people are reducing employment chances for younger people. ■ Pension adequacy should be guaranteed to avoid retirees having to work because of financial need. ■ Millions of Europeans beyond retirement age are already working. Institutions that were not designed with this development in mind need to be adjusted. For example, minimum wages do not always apply to retirees; employer insurance for absence from work due to illness may not be available for retirees; and periods outside employment may be required before a retiree is allowed to continue working. ■ Financial incentives should be reinforced so that work pays for the retiree by increasing future pension and current income. For the rest of society, work after retirement should benefit society through savings from public pension deferral, contributions to social security schemes, avoidance of undeclared work and added economic activity. Means-tested pensions are a disincentive to work. ■ Clear information and regulation are needed so that retirees who want to work, and employers who want to hire them, can do so and are not limited by misperceptions about consequences for taxes and pensions. 
Executive summary 3 ■ Open labour market policies, support for integration and availability of jobs benefit people of all ages. Many retirees have already given up looking for employment long before they retire. Lessons for companies ■ Retirees, or employees who are about to retire, have a choice not to work. They often want to work reduced hours, and their choice largely depends on whether companies provide such flexible options. ■ The importance of the work retirees do should be acknowledged, and a work environment conducive to their needs should be created. While these issues matter for people of all ages, retirees are more often motivated by social reasons and may be subject to specific negative stereotypes. ■ Pre-retirement conversations can change the assumptions of the retiree and of the employer and allow a tailor-made post-retirement option to be developed. ■ Training and mentoring roles for retirees can strengthen knowledge transfer, are well received among colleagues, and contribute to long-term solutions to skill mismatches by integrating younger workers. 

5 Introduction During the past few years it has become increasingly common for retirees to take on paid work in the EU. In the fourth quarter of 2011, 10.8% of 65- to 69-year-olds were employed, up from 8.9% in the same period in 2005. On the one hand, the increase in work after retirement 1 may reflect an increased need for retirees to supplement other sources of income. Income from state pensions, occupational pensions and savings have come under pressure (OECD, 2011) and costs have also increased. While these retirees had hoped to enjoy a well-deserved retirement, some may now be faced with a need to work in order to make ends meet. On the other hand, some retirees may work because they want to. Europeans are living longer and staying healthier than ever before (European Commission, 2012a) and may see paid employment as one way to stay in contact with others and contribute to society. They may also have financial motivations, but they would work even if they did not need the money. Despite the increase in uptake of paid work after retirement, most retirees are not involved in paid employment. They are involved in volunteering (Eurofound, 2011a), care for their partners, parents or other people close to them (Eurofound, 2011b) or spend their time in different ways. Others would like to work but are not in employment for various reasons, such as the inability to find a suitable job. This study investigates these retirees’ motivations for seeking paid work and their opportunities for gaining employment. The report aims to put this in the context of income adequacy for the retired population. Furthermore, trends are explored in the types of paid employment where working retirees are found. The report also identifies ways in which companies seek to recruit and retain retirees and has some important messages for policymakers. Policy relevance In the context of an ageing society, many EU policymakers stress the need for longer working lives (European Commission, 2012a), mainly through discouraging early retirement and increasing pension ages. These discussions tend to ignore the increased uptake of work beyond the statutory retirement age that is taking place. Adaptation of pension systems, increased employment among younger cohorts and increased productivity should contribute to solving income inadequacy in the longer run. Nevertheless, facilitating work beyond retirement for those who want to work can contribute to sustainable adequate pension systems. How common is it? Currently well over four million people over the age of 65 are in employment in the EU. Employment rates among retirees have increased even during the economic and financial crisis. When comparing the third quarter of 2007 with the same period in 2011, employment rates of people aged 65 to 69 increased from 9.9% to 10.5%, including self-employment. As nearly all Member States have statutory retirement ages at 65 or below, this group is composed almost exclusively of retirees. Quarterly data from earlier years, consistently available since the first quarter of 2005, confirm this trend (Figure 1). In sharp contrast, employment rates for 15- to 64-year-olds decreased from 65.9% to 64.6% between 2007 and 2011. 1 Retirement is defined as the age at which someone is entitled to a statutory or occupational pension (see ‘Concepts’ in Chapter 1), and a retiree as someone who has passed this age.

Between 2005 and 2011, most Member States experienced an increase of employment rates among 65- to 69-year-olds (Table 1). Nevertheless, eight (Portugal, Latvia, Slovenia, Cyprus, Estonia, Romania, Greece and Poland) showed a decrease. Except for Greece and Slovenia, these Member States had rates which were already well above the EU average. Most of them were also particularly hard hit by the economic crisis. Overall, the employment rate of 65- to 69-year-olds increased by 1.7% in the EU, from 8.8% in 2005 to 10.5% in 2011.

The work retirees undertake varies and retirees’ motivations to seek employment differ. Different groups are identified in this research and some generalisations are made to inform the policy process. Nevertheless, it is important to realise that even within these groups of retirees, and companies employing them, there are differences. Difference from work before retirement Much research has been done on older workers. There are different characteristics that change gradually with age that are relevant for work beyond retirement as well. Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe that work beyond retirement is different enough from work before retirement to deserve specific investigation. First, there is empirical evidence for some more abrupt changes in characteristics specific to those who work beyond retirement age. An example of such an abrupt change is a sharp increase in the prevalence of self-employment. Second, due to legislation which takes the retirement age as a threshold in terms of contractual arrangements but also tax policies, pension benefits and certain entitlements, different behaviour can be expected by companies and retirees. These are likely to impact quality of life and working conditions. An example includes the fact that subsidies for companies that employ disabled persons often do not apply to employed retirees. Third, the fact that retirees usually gain access to at least some pension income also impacts behaviour. Fourth, there are countries where contracts can be discontinued unilaterally by the employer at retirement age. Fifth, there is a sociological element: culturally, there are habits with regard to retirement that are strongly engrained in society. There are ideas about what is the normal thing to do; it is a personal benchmark for plans, and people can feel pressure about what they ‘should’ do when reaching the statutory retirement age. 

9 1 It is important to define the concept of ‘work after retirement’ as applied in this study. Even when the concept is clear, it is still hard to capture it precisely with specific indicators. After discussing the conceptual and measurement issues, the research process will be described. Concepts This study deals with paid employment, whether it is self-employment or salaried. Although the focus is on declared employment, undeclared employment also receives some attention. Retirement can be defined in multiple ways, especially in different country contexts. Here we define retirement as the age at which someone is entitled to a statutory or occupational pension. The study’s interest lies in those people who work beyond the pensionable age in the respective country or sector, whether they receive a pension or not, and whether or not it refers to the statutory retirement age for public pensions or to specific sectoral retirement ages, as set out in collective agreements, if they differ from the state pension age. It also includes instances where work is combined with full early retirement. Some might prefer to refer to the subject of interest as ‘work in retirement’ because they see retirement as a stage rather than an event, or as ‘work beyond pensionable age’, as retirement could be interpreted as referring to the status of not working. Work after the retirement age has also been called ‘silver work’ (Deller et al, 2011) and income from work after retirement as the ‘fourth pillar’ of income (Giarini, 2009). Other related concepts include ‘bridge employment’ (for example, Wang and Shultz, 2010), ‘unretirement’ or ‘reverse retirement’ (Maestas, 2004; McDonald, 1997) or ‘third career jobs’. Bridge employment can certainly be an example of work after retirement. Nevertheless, it focuses on the employment that bridges the transition from a career job to full exit from the labour market. Work after retirement does not necessarily do so. It also includes work taken up after a period of inactivity, sometimes described as unretirement or reverse retirement (see Chapter 3, ‘Continuity from previous employment’). Work beyond early retirement is included in this study, but not when that retirement is partial or when someone entitled to early retirement did not make use of it. It would include, for example, the case when someone takes full early retirement from one job and returns to the labour market in another job while receiving a full early pension. This study’s concept of work after retirement would not include the situation where someone made use of a partial or phased retirement plan and receives a 50% pension while staying at work for the remaining 50%. Measuring work after retirement The above definition enables assessment of whether a particular case can be described as work after retirement. Nevertheless, when reporting macro-level statistics, it is not feasible to exactly capture this group. Work can be measured in different ways. Administrative data could be available (for instance, from tax offices, pension funds and social security organisations), but alternatively, survey data is used. Sometimes only work done in the week preceding a certain survey is measured. As respondents might well have worked during other parts of the year but not in that particular week, it could cause some underreporting of work beyond retirement. Furthermore, a bottom threshold is sometimes applied, for example only counting ‘work’ if it exceeds one hour per week. Naturally, undeclared work often goes unreported in surveys and is absent from administrative sources. Concepts and data collection 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 10 Retirement is arguably more challenging to measure. Three approaches will be discussed below, using age, self-reported retirement or pension data. Age One measure of retirement that is used in this report is based on age. Based on the statutory retirement age in the specific countries, one can estimate trends in work after retirement by looking at employment rates beyond this age, assuming retirement ages have been rather constant. There are some complications. For example, EU data is usually based on surveys with reported ages rather than on administrative data with actual ages. Second, statutory retirement ages can differ according to sectors, but also among individuals based on years spent in employment, gender, marital status and number of children (OECD, 2011). When comparing developments in different countries, this report usually refers to people aged 65 and over. While expected increases in the retirement age might challenge future use of this cut-off point, currently it seems a reasonable measure. Nevertheless, some criticisms can be raised. This group of people might include some who are not yet retired. The precise retirement rules in different Member States with a retirement age of 65 sometimes imply working a few months into 65. Some of these people might wrongly be counted as retirees as they passed their 65th birthday. Four EU Member States actually have statutory retirement ages that can sometimes lie above 65. All concern flexible retirement options: between 65 and 66 for Ireland, 65 and 67 for Denmark, 61 and 67 for Sweden, and 62 and 68 for Finland. More importantly, the measure misses a larger number of retirees below the age of 65, as several Member States have statutory retirement ages below 65. The retirement age in France is 60 years. For Austria, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland and the UK, the same age applies for women. In Romania and Slovakia, the statutory retirement age for women even lies below 60. Early retirement options and sectoral arrangements add to this. Although the typical pensionable age in the EU is 65 years, the estimated average exit age from the labour force in 2009 was 61.4 years (Eurostat, 2012b). These younger retirees (below 65) are more likely to work (see below) and their age cohort is more populous than those of older retirees. As a consequence, the rate and the number of people working after their retirement are underestimated by estimates based on a cut-off point of 65. The characteristics of these younger retirees might systematically differ from those of older retirees. It is important to keep this in mind. Furthermore, it is questionable how much sense it makes to compare working retirees of the same age in Member States with different life expectancies. For example, working at the age of 65 can mean something different in Romania (with a retirement age of 63 for men and 58 for women) than it does in Spain (with a retirement age of 65 for men and women) because of the different life expectancies – 16 years at the age of 65 of in Romania, 21 years at the same age in Spain (WHO, 2012). Reported retirement Another approach is to use the self-reported status of being a retiree. Besides the obvious problems with self-reported data, categorising someone as a retiree is not only challenging for researchers, but can also be so for respondents themselves, even when a glossary is provided and applied. If people are working, they might not always see themselves as a retiree, even if they passed the statutory retirement age. This leads to an underestimation of the retirees who work. Questionnaire design 
Concepts and data collection 11 does not always allow for people to report that they are both retired and employed, or wording might simply suggest that being a ‘retiree’ and being ‘employed’ are mutually exclusive response categories. On the other hand, people below the occupational and statutory retirement ages might still see themselves as retired when they are inactive for another reason. This would also lead to underestimation of employment rates. There is also a group of people above the pensionable age who report themselves as home workers rather than retirees, sometimes because they have never had paid employment. If these pensioners without paid employment are not included, it would contribute to an overestimation of the post-retirement employment rate. Pension receipt Another measure of retirement is whether someone receives a public or occupational pension. Ideally, the data would come from administrative sources (from tax offices, pension funds and social security organisations). Nevertheless, such data are rarely available or publicly accessible. Alternatively, reported pension receipt in surveys can be used. Even with administrative data, some challenges remain in measuring the phenomenon of work after retirement. In some countries, people who have passed the age at which they are entitled to a state pension do not always receive a pension. Sometimes this is because pensions can be postponed. For public pensions, this is the case in almost all EU Member States (Table 12). Measures used in the report The country studies include case studies of public and private organisations that employ people above the age at which they are entitled to a statutory or occupational pension. For quantitative analysis, however, it is hard to precisely capture this group. Different measures are applied to give as complete a picture as possible. Nevertheless, much of the data presented will take the age of 65 and above as a proxy of retirement. Data collection The report is based on a literature review, quantitative analyses of EU databases, input from seven country reports and examples gathered from other EU Member States. The literature review includes evidence from the EU as well as the US. The US is a developed country where work beyond retirement has traditionally been more common than in the EU. In 2011, the US had an employment rate of 16.7% among those aged 65+ and 29.9% for the subgroup of 65- to 69-year-olds (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). This compares to 4.8% and 10.5%, respectively, in the EU. As a consequence, there are lessons to be learned from the US experience. While evidence comes from all across the EU, additional information was collected by examining seven Member States in more depth: Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden and the UK. Country reports are based on a national literature review, secondary data analysis, expert interviews and case studies in organisations employing retired people. At least three people were interviewed for each case study, including one retired worker, someone from the company’s management, and someone from the Human Resources department if the organisation has one. Most interviews were face-to-face. The rationale for the selection of these seven Member States was a mix of seeking maximum variation on the one hand and identifying countries where interesting cases can be found on the other hand. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 12 Selection of countries paid attention to differences with regard to welfare regimes and institutional pensions system arrangements, in particular the incentive systems in place to work after retirement and the presence of a pension age where employers have the right to discontinue permanent employment contracts. By examining such diverse contexts, it is more likely to identify lessons that can complement each other, whereas examining only contexts that resemble each other could limit applicability to similar countries only. On the other hand, if similar findings result from very different contexts, there is a case for generalisability and potential use across the EU. In particular, variety in the type of welfare state (Esping-Andersen, 1990; Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser, 2011) of a particular country was sought. Welfare state characteristics are likely to influence the motivations of retirees and the conditions of their employment. Austria and Germany are considered ‘pure’ Christian democratic countries. While Italy also fits in this category, it has often been grouped with other countries, usually as a ‘Mediterranean’ type. Sweden is classified as a ‘pure’ social democratic country, while the UK is usually categorised as ‘liberal’. While arguably converging to the above welfare regime types, the Czech Republic and Poland have been classified as being different enough from the other clusters with regard to important welfare dimensions to be included in a ‘post-communist’ welfare regime type (Fenger, 2007). To determine where the most interesting examples were likely to be found, Member States with relatively large increases in employment rates among retirees were prioritised. Four of the seven Member States show larger increases in employment rates among the 65- to 69-year-olds than the EU average: the UK, Austria, Germany and Sweden (Table 1). The Czech Republic, Italy and Poland have lower growth rates than the EU average. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic is very close to the EU average. Italy has a higher rate than, for example, France and Spain. Furthermore, rates in Italy increased slightly over the past few years, in contrast to, for example, Portugal, where work after retirement has become less common. Poland was considered an interesting country for investigation. Being among the few showing a decline in work after retirement, it is the only EU Member State that has – overall – suffered relatively little from the recession. So, companies might have had to put a relatively large effort into attracting retirees. On the other hand, 37% of people in Poland reported that they wanted to work after retirement, above the 33% EU average (European Commission, 2012b), and the country still has higher rates of work after retirement than, for example, Slovakia or Bulgaria. As part of the research, Eurostat Labour Force Survey (LFS) data were used to identify the most frequent clusters of working retirees along certain variables (such as gender and sector). The seven selected Member States are represented in all five principal clusters that emerged from this analysis, and most of them fall into different clusters (Table 11). For example, Austria and Germany each have a very different prominent group of working retirees, and the Czech Republic and Poland also fall into different clusters. The review of the literature took place in 2011 and the first half of 2012. The same holds for the analysis of EU data. The country reports were written by five different contractors in 2011 (Austria, Poland and Sweden) and the first half of 2012 (the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and the UK). 
13 2 Trends in adequacy and sustainability of retirement income Income adequacy Sources of income Income after retirement can come from a variety of sources (Figure 2). State pensions (means-tested or not) and occupational pensions together form the largest component (European Commission, 2012a; OECD, 2011; SPC, 2012). Overall, public pensions account for around 60% of incomes of over-65s. There are differences between Member States; for example, in France and Hungary, public transfers account for about 85% of incomes (OECD, 2011). Occupational plans are sometimes provided publicly (in Finland, for instance) but are usually largely private, subject to public regulation. While relatively small in some countries, they account for around 30% of old-age income in Finland, the Netherlands and the UK (OECD, 2011). Nevertheless, significant parts of the population go uncovered by such occupational schemes or accumulate few pension entitlements in these Member States. Figure 2: Sources of income after retirement Post- retirement household income Donations (e.g. by children) and inherited wealth Personal savings & investments (e.g. owned housing) Occupational pension State pension Social benefits Work Source: Eurofound While overall these two sources of retirement income are predominant, for some groups and for some countries, other sources of retirement income – such as transfers from children or housing benefits – are also significant. With the surge in employment among retirees, paid work becomes an increasingly relevant source of income as well. Analysis of EU-SILC data shows that, in 2009, income from work amounted to 7% of gross individual income of people aged 65+, compared to nearly 85% for those of working age. 21 This income from work refers to cash income from salaried employment and self-employment, including losses from business as well. There are country differences, with, for example, people aged 65+ in Ireland and Latvia earning relatively large shares of their incomes from work (more than 12%). By contrast, in Romania and Slovakia, for example, people aged 65+ earn particularly small shares of their income from work (less than 4%). Furthermore, there is a difference between age groups, with younger retirees earning a larger share of their incomes from work. 2 Gross individual income includes income from work (self-employment and salaried), education-related allowances, and unemployment, old-age, survivor, sickness and disability benefits. Income measured at the household level (for example, from property) is excluded. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 14 Many European aged 65 years or more do not gain any income from work at all. As a consequence, the proportion of income gained from work is considerably higher for the group of people who work after retirement: well over half for people aged 65+. For about a quarter of them, paid work provides less than one-fifth of their income, but for almost two-fifths of people aged 65+ it provides more than 80% of their income. Younger retirees are not only more likely to work than older ones (see Chapter 3, ‘Age’), but if they are in employment, they also tend to earn a larger share of their income from work than older working retirees. Among those aged 65+ who work, there is a strongly negative correlation between the income from other sources and the share of income from work. Working retirees with high income from other sources receive relatively large amounts of income from work, but this forms a relatively small share of their overall income. For working retirees with lower overall incomes, income from work forms a more important share of their total income. Pension adequacy has several dimensions. The base level of income provided, the net replacement rate (pensions relative to previous earnings), taxing of retirement income and the availability of in- kind public benefits all matter. The Global Pension Index ranking took some of these dimensions and others into account when evaluating six EU Member States and the US (ACFS and Mercer, 2011). In 2011, the Netherlands and France were reported to have the highest adequacy, while the UK and Sweden scored somewhat lower. Poland and Germany were at the bottom but still above the US. Among the five EU Member States for which 2010 and 2011 data are available, four (the Netherlands, France, Germany and especially Sweden) showed a decrease in rating with regard to adequacy, while only one (the UK) improved somewhat. Retiree income, magnitude and trends On average, retirees’ incomes lie below incomes of those of ‘working age’. In 2010, the median income of people aged 65 years and over in the EU was 88% of that of 16- to 65-year-olds (Figure 3). There are only two Member States where the median income for people aged 65+ lies slightly above that of 16- to 65-year-olds: Hungary (101%) and Luxembourg (105%). In the other Member States, inequality in median earnings between these age groups varies largely, with relatively low incomes in Cyprus (64%), Denmark (71%), Estonia (73%) and Bulgaria (74%). In some Member States the median income of the 65+ age group lies much closer to the income of 16- to 65-year-olds (at 93% in Poland, 92% in Italy and Lithuania and 91% in Austria). It should be taken into account, though, that living conditions of relatively low-income retirees in the richest Member States are well beyond those of even the better off in the poorest Member States. While the median income of the 65+ age group remained lower than that of 16- to 65-year-olds in the EU in 2010, the difference has decreased over the past few years. People aged 65+ were worse off compared to those aged 16 to 65 in 2010 than they were in 2007 in only four Member States: Sweden, Austria, Bulgaria and especially Poland. Besides cross-national differences, there are large differences between individuals and groups. Among those worst off are retirees who have been excluded from the labour market for prolonged periods over their life for different reasons, including discrimination at some point along their life course, or who have been in low-paid employment. For women, the income difference is more marked than for men. Women of 65 years and older earn 86% of the mean income of women aged 16–64 years, which already lies well below the income of men of aged 16–64 years. For men, the rate is higher at 92%. This gender difference is up to 15% in Poland, Romania and Slovenia and 14% in Sweden, while this difference is negative (–1%) only in Ireland and Malta. The gender difference can largely be explained by relatively low savings and 
Trends in adequacy and sustainability of retirement income 15 work-dependent pension accumulation. In their lives, women generally pass through longer periods of part-time work, lower wages and longer periods of economic inactivity. Much of this is due to women’s relatively large role in informal work, such as childcare and housework (for example, Choi, 2001; European Parliament, 2011; TUC, 2012). In some Member States the statutory retirement age for women is lower than that for men, regardless of their longer healthy life expectancy, often with fewer options to accumulate savings and pension contributions. The European Commission’s White Paper (2012a) recommends against such sex-based differences.

In particular, it concerns the share with an (equivalised) disposable income below 60% of the median income for the current year and at least two out of the preceding three years. Poverty rates for those people who reported to be ‘retirees’ lie somewhat below those of the population as a whole and they also lie below those of older people below the pensionable age. One reason for this is that income inequality among retirees is relatively low (European Commission, 2010b). While overall incomes among retirees lie below those of younger age groups, drops are relatively large for those with high incomes. Another potential explanation for larger observed income equality among older people is that the poorest tend to die earlier. Furthermore, between 2007 and 2010, poverty rates among retirees decreased in the EU. Nevertheless, if one uses an age-based instead of a self-reported measure of retirement, poverty rates among the 65+ age group are actually somewhat higher (16%) than among those aged 16 to 64 (15.5%) and are considerably higher than among 55- to 64-year-olds (13.6%). As discussed in Chapter 1 (‘Measuring work after retirement’), differences between these measures could be explained by the different groups they cover, with, for example, home workers (who frequently do 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 16 not report themselves to be retired) and older retirees (more represented in the age measure) being particularly poor. Overall, about a fifth of people aged 65 or over have pension incomes that are so close to the poverty risk threshold (just below or just above) that relatively small increases or decreases in their pensions can lead to important variations in the poverty rates of the elderly (SPC, 2012). Adequacy beyond income Even when a household would not fall below the poverty threshold in terms of income, it can still be hard to make ends meet if expenses are high. Table 2 shows that the proportion of households reporting to have (some or great) difficulties making ends meet generally lies well above that of those at risk of poverty. Households with at least one adult over 65 years old are somewhat less likely to have difficulties with making ends meet than other households. People over 65 who live alone are struggling more than those who live together. For one-adult households, 53.6% have difficulties making ends meet if this person is 65 years or older. For larger households with at least one member aged 65 or older, 44.5% have difficulty making ends meet. For households of all ages together, the number is larger, at 55.2%. This higher rate can mostly be attributed to households with children, while those without children report much lower rates. There are also large differences within these groups of households with at least one member aged 65 years or older. Retirees in some Member States are more at risk than in others. In Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Lithuania, people aged 65+ most often report difficulties making ends meet, whereas Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Sweden are the Member States where the 65+ have difficulties making ends meet least often. Table 2: Percentage of households with some or great difficulty making ends meet, EU, 2010 One adult 65+ Two adults, at least one 65+ Bulgaria 97.7 94.5 Romania 94.2 89.2 Hungary 90.5 88.4 Lithuania 94.8 88.0 Latvia 89.1 83.8 Greece 88.5 81.8 Slovakia 86.8 81.7 Portugal 82.7 76.5 Poland 81.7 75.9 Italy 78.5 71.6 Cyprus 80.9 70.7 Malta 69.1 68.6 Czech Republic 72.0 62.2 Slovenia 72.9 61.0 Estonia 71.8 57.7 Spain 61.3 54.5 France 64.3 53.9 Ireland 47.6 45.6

Whether someone is at risk of social exclusion depends on whether their household has problems making ends meet, but also on their extent of debt and enforced lack of basic necessities as well as their physical and social environment. In 2010, one out of five (19.8%) of those aged 65+ in the EU were at risk of poverty or social exclusion (Figure 4). This is considerably lower than the rate for those aged 18 to 64, which amounted to 23.2% in the same year. Poverty and social exclusion are somewhat higher among those who report to be retired (20.6%) than when the age-based measure is used (see Chapter 1, ‘Measuring work after retirement’). It seems plausible that the age measure does not capture a group of socially excluded younger retirees, many unemployed or inactive. On the other hand, the retiree measure does not capture some retirees who are above the poverty threshold and do not see themselves as retirees because they work. Nevertheless, the share of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion among self-reported retirees is still below the rate for 18- to 64-year-olds. Women retirees are clearly worse off than male retirees and remain at risk of poverty or social exclusion more often than other parts of the population, regardless of the measure used, confirming the gender issue discussed above. While this is true for the population as a whole, the gender difference is particularly pronounced for retirees. Furthermore, there are large differences between Member States. In Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and the UK, the proportion of people aged 65 and older at risk of poverty and social exclusion is more than 1 percentage point higher than the proportion for 18–64-year-olds. In 2007, the rate of retirees (both for the age-based and the self-reported retiree measure) at risk of poverty or social exclusion was still higher than the rate for 18- to 64-year-olds (using the age-based measure, it was already lower only for men). In 2011 the situation was reversed, with retirees now generally less at risk of poverty or social exclusion than the population as a whole.

The impact of the crisis is likely to be more immediate for people below retirement age who lost their jobs and are faced with suddenly decreased income, while the impact on retirement income tends to be somewhat less immediate if that income did not come from work or working children. Nevertheless, income levels are relatively low, and retirees also compare unfavourably in terms of some non- monetary measures. Furthermore, there are many individual retirees who have been affected by the crisis, for example by being driven into unfavourable early retirement schemes. Female retirees, those who live alone, who are particularly old and who have health problems are relatively vulnerable. Income is not all that matters, with retirees being relatively worse off in terms of non-monetary deprivation measures. Furthermore, part of the explanation of a moderate impact of the economic crisis could lie in the fact that retirees started to take on paid work purely because of financial need. Setbacks in economic growth, public budgets, financial stability and employment because of the recent financial crisis have aggravated concerns about pension adequacy. Pensions have come under pressure and overall replacement rates are expected to decrease considerably between 2008 and 2048 in most EU Member States (bar Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and the UK) (European Commission, 2012a). Occupational pensions have seen important losses over the past few years in many EU Member States, mainly because of declining stock markets and low interest rates. Early retirement, often involuntary as part of redundancy rounds, has left many with lower pensions, especially among workers who were already low paid in the first place. Future prospects for this source of income in retirement are further challenged by consistent low income and long unemployment spells (EPC/SPC/EC, 2010). Companies suffering from the recession are also less eager to contribute to pension plans and some occupational pensions are not adjusted for inflation and are sometimes decreased. 
Trends in adequacy and sustainability of retirement income 19 Private individual savings are unlikely to be sufficient for most of the population. Low wages leave little room for many to accumulate enough savings. Underestimation of future needs, or low importance attached to these needs at earlier ages, and overly optimistic expectations of future income also play a role. Low return on investment, low interest rates, high inflation and longer lives require more savings to achieve similar income levels after retirement. Decreased incomes make saving harder. With income from all these sources being under threat for some population groups, many retirees simultaneously face increased costs. Recent cuts in government funding often lie at the root of cost increases. For example, in Member States with decreased public funding for healthcare, out-of-pocket payments have increased. VAT has increased in several Member States (such as Romania in 2010 and Italy and Spain in 2012) as have other taxes. Saving is a challenge for those with low incomes in particular. Some (both retirees and non-retirees) dip into their future pension entitlements and accumulated savings in order to address immediate needs, triggered, for example, by household debt problems, healthcare costs or other disruptive life events. One way to address these immediate needs is through ‘early pension release offers’ or opting for one-off payments instead of yearly payments when reaching the retirement age, eroding future retirement income adequacy. Income sustainability Pension reforms The issue of pension adequacy is closely related to sustainability. While it is good news that Europeans are living longer, with unchanged policy and high public and private debt, adequate pension provision might prove unsustainable, especially in Member States with less defined contribution schemes. As part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Commission presents pension system reform (such as reducing early retirement schemes and increasing retirement age) as a macroeconomic prerequisite for growth (European Commission, 2010a) and reminds Member States that as people live longer, they also need to stay in employment longer and save more for their retirement. The increase in expenditure required to guarantee current levels of adequacy would otherwise be unsustainable (European Commission, 2012a). It has been argued that further extension of working lives and creation of employment opportunities for older workers are necessary to ensure the sustainability of the system, but also to avoid labour market shortages (BusinessEurope, 2012). Recent reforms in many Member States have tried to accommodate changes in the economic and social environment through labour market policies encouraging people to work longer and by moving from single to multi-tiered pension systems to lower the share of pay-as-you-go pensions (European Commission, 2010b). Early retirement has been effectively discouraged in different ways by the Member States (European Commission, 2012a). Countries where workers are entitled to a public pension after spending a certain number of years in employment have raised the minimum number of years required. In addition, most Member States increased the retirement age or have committed to doing so over the next few decades (MISSOC, 2012). The Global Pension Index brought together several dimensions in measuring sustainability among six Member States, with France, Germany and Poland scoring lowest, while the UK system was judged more sustainable, and the Swedish and Dutch the most sustainable. There is some trade-off between adequacy and sustainability. For example, Sweden’s system became less adequate but more sustainable according to the index. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 20 While a clear policy priority in many Member States, public opinion seems less decided. Only one in three Europeans agrees with the idea that the official retirement age will have to be increased by 2030 (European Commission, 2012b). Furthermore, there are equity concerns. The issue of life expectancy is an important factor in the relationship between sustainability and adequacy on the one hand and equity on the other. An increase in the pension age makes sense when taking increased healthy life expectancy into account. Several Member States plan linking retirement age to life expectancy at the national level (OECD, 2007), converting the life expectancy statistics into an even more policy-sensitive topic. There are equity concerns. Life expectancy differs largely not only between countries, but also within Member States – between regions, socio-economic groups (Marmot and Shipley, 1996), occupations, gender and individuals, especially in urban areas (Hayward et al, 1997). For example, there is an eight-year difference in life expectancy in France for men in different categories of work (Reday-Mulvey, 2008). Nevertheless, social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on a non-work measure (Marmot and Shipley, 1996). Overall, though, pension transfers can thus imply a net transfer of resources from groups with low life expectancy to sections of the population with high life expectancy: from the poor to the rich, from men to women and from those in low-quality jobs or long-term unemployment to those in high-quality employment. Dependency ratios The demographic dependency ratio has played a key role in the debate with regard to pension sustainability. Dramatic projected increases in the demographic dependency ratio have caught the attention of media and policymakers alike. It is important to pay attention to changes in the age structure of society; increases in longevity and the transition into retirement of baby boomers will have a far-reaching impact. Nevertheless, dependency ratios, especially if based on age structure, can be deceptive measures if their limitations are not recognised. Demographic dependency ratios are usually defined as the population of non-working age relative to the population of working age, often operationalised as a ratio of the population aged 65+ to the population aged 15 to 64 (for example, OECD, 2011). The dependency ratio for the EU27 is expected to increase from 26% in 2010, or one person aged 65+ for every four persons aged 15 to 64, to 31% in 2020, or one person aged 65+ for almost every three persons aged 15 to 64. Some criticisms can be raised that do not challenge the concept of demographic dependency ratios as such, but rather the way it has been used. Firstly, demographic dependency ratios are hard to predict in the far future with precision because of complex and uncertain immigration, mortality and fertility rates. While projections for the next decade or so are often pretty accurate, predicting such ratios for many decades into the future is challenging. Second, the analyses tend to focus on the peak in these ratios, when baby boomers reach old age, ignoring developments after their climax is reached. Third, the fact that the ‘old-age crisis’ was already a concern more than two decades ago (see, for example, World Bank, 1994) also challenges the often dramatic tone of the discussion. Fourth, children are excluded. Decreased fertility rates also imply fewer children to be taken care of, which is by no means reflected in the demographic dependency ratios according to their usual cut- off age of 15 or even 20. Lastly, the magnitude, speed and timing of population ageing vary largely across Member States (Zaidi, 2011). Besides these criticisms of the way the demographic dependency ratio has been presented, one can also challenge the very nature of the demographic dependency ratio as a policy-relevant measure. 
Trends in adequacy and sustainability of retirement income 21 In particular, analyses based purely on the demographic dependency ratio bluntly ignore the fact that employment rates among those of working age, working hours, productivity and exit ages are not necessarily fixed parameters. Where demographic dependency ratios suggest that there are fewer and fewer young people to support older people, the fact is that many of the young – and older– people are currently unemployed or inactive, while they would be willing to take on paid employment. Increased employment rates can offset the impact of retirees leaving the labour market. Economic dependency ratios (Wöss and Türk, 2011) or labour-market-adjusted dependency ratios (Guerzoni and Zuleeg, 2011) do take this into account. The economic dependency ratio divides the number of unemployed, pensioners (old-age, early retirement, disability) and discouraged (inactive because unable to find a job) by the number of people in paid employment. The economic dependency ratio (65% in 2010) suggests a much higher dependency in society than the demographic dependency ratio (26% in 2010) does. Nevertheless, if the Europe 2020 target of 75% employment among 20- to 64-year-olds is reached, the economic dependency ratio is estimated to show a decrease (from 65% to 57%) instead of an increase, as the demographic dependency ratio does (from 26% to 31%). Another measure, the total economic dependency ratio, also includes inactive sections of the population other than unemployed, pensioners and the discouraged (such as children). This ratio is projected even to decrease by 13 percentage points (from 129% in 2010 to 116% in 2020) if the Europe 2020 targets are reached (Türk, 2012). These decreases could be somewhat lower, if the ambitious Europe 2020 target is not met, but still showing a trend nowhere near the one shown by the demographic dependency ratio. Economic dependency ratios tell only part of the story. For example, economic dependency ratios still ignore productivity increases. The annual growth rate in labour productivity is projected to be 1.5% in the long term (European Commission, 2012d). This amounts to more than 16% GDP growth purely generated on productivity increases in the following decade. Furthermore, temporary higher rates are expected in Member States that are catching up. Such productivity increases mean that a constant labour input can sustain similar levels of quality of life for a larger group of people. While it can be deceptive to overly rely on productivity growth, it is also unrealistic to assume there will be no growth in productivity at all. Furthermore, these dependency ratios do not specify the number of hours worked. If people (in particular those in part-time employment who would like to work more hours) work more hours but employment rates remain unchanged, a higher economic dependency ratio would be less of a concern from a perspective of economic sustainability. Overall, and most importantly in relation to this report, demographic dependency ratios usually assume that people over 65 are ‘dependent’ and unproductive. Besides the normative connotation in such terminology, this does not reflect reality. As older people are in increasingly good health, it could be argued that societies are rejuvenating, not ageing. Many retirees are involved in voluntary and informal work. Most Member States have already increased retirement ages or plan to do so over the next few decades, some connecting them to life expectancies. Furthermore, as is clear from this report, more and more retirees all over the EU are actually in paid employment, many because they want to be. This development can mitigate the impact of ageing societies. Recognising the importance of this development, labour rates of the 65+ age group are now included along with measures of levels of debt and public spending on health and pensions in assessing the financial stability of different countries (Maplecroft, 2011). 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 22 All these caveats do not necessarily mean that the situation is less urgent than often suggested. For example, hours worked might well decline, with projections of a fall by more than 5% in total hours worked in the EU (and 4% in the euro area) by 2060 (EU, 2011). Employment rates of retirees and non-retirees might also decline rather than increase. Nevertheless, the important message here is that more factors need to be taken into account in the discussion than is usually the case, and work beyond retirement is one of them. 
23 3 Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement Each retiree has their own reasons for taking up work beyond retirement, or not. It can be planned or unplanned (Maestas, 2004). An explanatory framework will be presented. Some groups of people are more likely to work after retirement than others. Patterns and trends in time can be observed. The type of work done by retirees shows certain specific characteristics, which are explored as well. There is a close relationship between the reasons for work after retirement, the groups of people most likely to be involved in such employment and the type of work they do. Explaining working after retirement Broadly speaking, retirees work because they need to or because they want to. Often the decision is based on a mix of necessity and interest. Nevertheless, even if a retiree wants and needs to work, suitable opportunities might not be found. Figure 5 illustrates the different forces at play. Various elements of this framework exert more influence depending on the context. For example, in countries in crisis, with inadequate pension systems, the need might be high but opportunities scarce. Figure 5: Explaining work after retirement Interest Opportunities WORK? Need Source: Eurofound Need Financial need of retirees depends on different factors. Little pension might have been accumulated due to long unemployment spells, low-paid work, part-time work, not having sought paid employment, having been on disability benefits for extended periods of time or a prolonged inability to combine work with caring, for example for a child. The financial downturn has also resulted in a sharp decline in wealth for many, with some dipping into their pension savings (see Chapter 3, ‘Income adequacy’, and case studies 1 and 4 on the German newspaper and the UK public healthcare provider). 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 24 Case study 1: German newspaper Regional newspaper Sector Publishing and delivery Employees 615 (of whom 375 are deliverers, of which 48% are retirees) Gender balance 55% female, 45% male (about 70% female versus 30% male for deliverers) All retirees working on newspaper delivery rounds are employed part time. Many of them are disabled. Some are over 80 years old. Often they already worked for the company for decades. Those who have one round earn less than €400 per month, and are exempted from social insurance contributions. Deliverers with more rounds earn at most €800 per month and make reduced social insurance contributions. The remuneration is a fixed amount per route, according to the number of mail items distributed. Pensioners often take a long time to complete their routes, earning low hourly wages. They attach particular importance to job security. Low statutory (and no private) pension entitlements cause these people to carry out this work, often in spite of illness. An indication of how they struggle to make ends meet is that requests for wage advances are received by the company at the end of each month, for example to buy car fuel for delivery rounds. Of the two retirees interviewed, one has had continuous low income over their life and low retirement income as a consequence. The other’s pension savings were drawn upon when helping his son with a failed family business. One of the two has a chronic illness. Some retirees are entitled to basic social security benefits but fail to claim them out of pride or reluctance to undergo the necessary formalities. The delivery staff must work at night, in any weather. If the papers come late from the press, the working hours may extend into the morning, which deliverers are compensated for financially. Heavy lifting or pulling weighty handcarts, difficulties in accessing letterboxes and potential dangers of slipping in the wintertime present health risks. Long waiting times for the newspapers, sudden obstacles (road works and building sites, locked gates, dogs running free) and searching for new delivery addresses can lead to mental stress. The employer appreciates that absence is low because of a high sense of duty. Deliverers were further reported to fail to claim certain rights with the company, such as non-delivery in case of dangerous situations, were prepared to take on additional work during the day or substitute for colleagues and they rarely complain. On the other hand, expenditure could well be higher. Increased healthcare (or health insurance) expenses (Herz, 1995) are a particularly important factor. While in the US health insurance coverage has been cited as a motivation to work beyond retirement, this is less likely to be the case in the EU, with its mostly universal health care systems. Nevertheless, in some cases, occupational private health care insurance can play a role. Retirees with mortgages are more likely to work beyond retirement (Smeaton and McKay, 2003). Having children or a spouse can also contribute to an increased need for additional income. For example, when children become unemployed, parents may support them (see case study 2, the Italian supermarket). On the other hand, children and spouses can also contribute to household income. Furthermore, having faced a crisis such as divorce can also trigger a need to work (Barnes et al, 2004). Longer life expectancies also imply an enhanced need for resources (Herz, 1995). US data suggest that experiencing a relatively large drop in income when moving from retirement to non-retirement and entering retirement unexpectedly (Herz, 1995) all contribute to an increased chance of searching for work after retirement, partly because of the increased need triggered by these factors. 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 25 Case study 2: Italian supermarket Super Elite Sector Retail Employees 32, of which one is a retiree Gender balance 50% female, 50% male (the working retiree is male) The working retiree is 73 years old. He is a gastronome counter operator in a supermarket. His highest level of education is primary school. Until his retirement (at 61), he was a supermarket employee. At retirement, he started a small shop in partnership with a younger colleague. In 2011 the shop ceased operating because the business did not go very well. He applied to work at the supermarket (which is a different one from where he worked before retirement) because it was well known and close by. He receives a pension of €900 per month and still does not know if the new income will impact his pension receipts, but this will appear on his next tax return. The main reason why he works is that he wants to support his adult children financially. He and his wife have three children, one of who is unemployed and has two daughters, while another one is unemployed and has recently been evicted from his house, whereas the third has financial problems because of a divorce. When asked, ‘Why doesn’t one of your children do this work for you?’ he replied, ‘Because they do not have the needed expertise in this task.’ The retiree enjoys the work, and says, ‘I live for my clients, contacts with other people and smiles of people ... I will die if I stop.’ The manager understood the difficult situation of the retiree and wanted to help him. He was also aware of his great experience and skills in this work area and identified the retiree’s work history with his own. The manager is responsible for four supermarkets. In three of them, there is a retiree in charge of the gastronomic counter. The decision for employees to work beyond retirement is taken by the employee together with the manager, in the absence of an HR department. While the manager considers 20 to 40 years to be the ideal age profile, he thinks younger employees often lack experience. On the other hand, in the case of working retirees, he feels the need to be careful in assigning specific tasks, for example lifting heavy food products. The manager is not aware of any labour market policies, tax and benefit systems, equal opportunity regulations or social protection policies that would support work for retired people; he never tried to inform himself about these. Avoiding poverty is certainly an important factor in explaining work beyond retirement. For example, the large difference in uptake of work beyond retirement in the UK compared with Germany is partly due to higher poverty rates in the UK (Scherger et al, 2012, forthcoming). Those who work to avoid poverty often work under the worst conditions (Lain, 2012; see also case study 1 above, the German newspaper). Nevertheless, financial need is not restricted to the poorest. Even the best-off have made financial commitments before entering retirement or got used to a certain level of living conditions (Wang et al, 2008). For example, in a 2008 US survey, 18% of working retirees reported that they keep working because of insufficient income from other sources, while 53% might cope but simply ‘want to keep earning money to retire more comfortably’ (Brown et al, 2010). In the UK, a 2011 survey found that two-thirds of those planning to work past state retirement age indicated that it was because they cannot afford to retire (LV=, 2011), even though many of them do not live in poverty. Interest Others report that they work beyond retirement, or plan to do so, because they want to (see case study 3 below, the German research institute). While most (54%) Europeans report they do not want to work after they reach the official pension age, one out of three (33%) state that they would like to continue working after reaching the age when they are entitled to a pension (European Commission, 2012b). The rate is particularly high among respondents close to retirement (41% among those aged 55+), whose views arguably say more about actual intentions. There are also differences among Member States, with particularly high rates in Denmark, the UK, Estonia, Latvia, Ireland and Sweden. The figures can be challenged. As the survey covered EU residents aged 15 years and over, it also asked the question to the unemployed. Furthermore, the very young might find it hard to look so far into the future. These issues can explain why a relatively high proportion (13%) report that they do not know. Response categories do not allow for nuanced answers, for example conditional on health at retirement and on working conditions. Respondents might also sometimes report to ‘want to’ work purely because they need the additional income. While the precise numbers 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 26 can be challenged, the data do suggest that a considerable group of Europeans want to work after retirement. Qualitative and quantitative evidence from national research (Deller et al, 2011) confirms this observation, including the seven national research reports with case studies in organisations employing retired people. Furthermore, the data are supported by Eurofound analysis of 2010 European Social Survey (ESS) data (Table 3). Workers aged 65 years or older relatively often say they would enjoy working in their job even if they did not need the money. In the EU, on average, 64.1% of workers in the 65+ age group would do so, compared to 50.5% among 55- to 64-year-olds. It is interesting to see this in the light of research showing that intrinsic motivation increases with age (Inceoglu et al, 2012). On the other hand, one out of five (21.4%) workers aged 65 years or older would not enjoy working in their job if they did not need the money, suggesting that an important share of retirees is working out of financial need and would be happier without this need. As expected, these are relatively often retirees with low household incomes. Nevertheless, there are also many working retirees with lower household incomes who would enjoy working in their current jobs even if they did not need the money (around half). Table 3: Non-financial motives to work among people in paid employment, EU, 2010 ‘I would enjoy working in my current job even if I did not need the money’ 14–54 years % 55–64 years % 65+ years % Agree 47.0 50.5 64.1 Neither agree nor disagree 18.7 17.0 14.5 Disagree 34.4 32.5 21.4 Note: ‘Agree/disagree’ stands for ‘agree/disagree or strongly agree/disagree’; design-weighted only, so data refer to country averages of percentages; n = 23,590. Source: Eurofound analysis of ESS 2010 microdata, 28 March 2012 version Social reasons play a role. Those with a large proportion of friends among colleagues are more inclined to work beyond retirement because an important part of their social interactions take place at work. Retirees with younger friends also tend to be more inclined to work beyond retirement, as they otherwise have fewer opportunities to engage in post-retirement activities with their friends (Fillenbaum and Maddox, 1974). The case studies indicate that social relations with colleagues as well as with clients are considered important (see case studies 2 and 5, the Italian supermarket and the Swedish self-employed consultants). In general, being in contact with others has been repeatedly identified as a key reason for work after retirement (Deller and Maxin, 2009; von Bonsdorff et al, 2009). These social elements play an important role in quality of life of older people (Bowling et al, 2002). Social relations at work might not always be expected to continue in the same way as before reaching the retirement age. Age discrimination at the workplace can accelerate after reaching the retirement age, particularly due to negative reactions from colleagues when working after retirement because of ingrained social norms, such as the idea of ‘making way for a younger generation’, which can have a negative influence. Social relations at home also matter. Someone works longer if their partner does so (Helman et al, 2008; Maestas, 2004). In Denmark, being married increases the likelihood of working after retirement 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 27 for men but decreases it for women (Larsen and Pedersen, 2012). Evidence from the US shows that within a marriage, retirement expectations are shaped by individual, spousal and household characteristics. Some gender differences in spousal influence were observed, with wives’ retirement expectations being more influenced by husbands’ resources and constraints than vice versa in heterosexual couples. Nonetheless, individual and household factors associated with retirement expectations are widely shared by husbands and wives (Pienta and Hayward, 2002). In terms of work content, having a successful employment history before retirement increases the chance of someone working after retirement. In the US, people with ‘more marginal work histories’ were less likely to sustain work efforts after retirement, despite large need because of lower income (Morrow-Howell and Leon, 1988). Overall, job satisfaction is a key determinant of retirement decisions (Kosloski et al, 2001). Seeing work as a meaningful life experience –measured with items such as membership in a large number of professional associations – also proved significant in stimulating work after retirement (Fillenbaum and Maddox, 1974), as did strong identification with work, seeing it as way to help others, bring society forward, stay active and keep developing (Deller and Maxin, 2009; von Bonsdorff et al, 2009). Feeling truly needed for an assignment also contributes (Helman et al, 2008). Working retirees also see work as part of life, seeking recognition or using work to fulfil personal challenges and achieve personal fulfilment (Graetz et al, 2011). Working conditions and institutional arrangements play a role. Retirees are more interested in working if flexible work arrangements are possible and if work beyond retirement generates sufficient increases in net income (Burtless and Moffitt, 1985; Helman et al, 2008; Wang and Shultz, 2010). These issues will be discussed in more depth below. All the above-mentioned factors are of varying importance to different individuals even within the same occupational group. For example, a survey among nurses in the US revealed that factors which influenced the retirement decision included financial independence for 75%, poor health for 63%, work intensity for 48%, spouse’s poor health for 39% and spouse’s early retirement for 28% (Cyr, 2005). There are other motivations as well, such as fear of the health impact of retiring (see the Italian supermarket above). Case study 3: German research institute Social Research Centre Sector Research in social sciences Employees 67 (3 working retirees) Gender balance 51% female, 49% male All three retirees are employed part time, while overall this applies to only 34% of employees. Two retirees are employed as part-time research assistants, one as a ‘mini-jobber’, with earnings up to €400 per month, exempted from social contributions. The interviewed working retiree is a 65-year-old female research assistant. She holds a doctoral degree in sociology and has been working for the institute since 1982. She was deputy managing director from 1989 to 2002 and has been responsible for project work, often acting as project leader. She is a member of various committees. The date of her retirement coincided with the start of two projects for whose acquisition she was mainly responsible. Prior to retirement, she was already certain that she wanted to continue working in some way. She has reached an agreement with management that she will be allowed to take several breaks during the year, with a possible duration of up to two months. She fears that if she stops working now, these fields, and consequently her life’s work, could be undermined. Therefore, she also makes a special point of being responsible for the development of young scientists. Such intrinsic motivation was shared by the other working retirees as well, according to the deputy managing director. For some at the institute, having had children relatively late in life, who take up university studies at the time of their parent’s retirement, also plays a role. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 28 Opportunities Labour markets might not provide suitable opportunities to retirees who would like, or have to, work. The fewer options there are available, the harder it is to find them. The two EU Member States that saw the largest drop in rates of work beyond retirement since 2005 are Latvia and Portugal. These are among the Member States that suffered most from the economic crisis and where unemployment soared. While on the one hand the crisis had a negative impact on income (and expected income) after retirement and thus increased the need to work, on the other hand, increased unemployment decreased available opportunities to work. While better-educated retirees might be more likely to work in times of crisis, for example because of decreased incomes from investments, for those with less education, the negative moderation of the ‘opportunity’ factor has been proven dominant in a US context, with less-educated retirees left out of the labour market because of increased unemployment, regardless of increased need (Coile and Levine, 2009). It should be noted that organisations (especially public organisations) with recruitment freezes and those economising on recruitment costs could well have an incentive to retain employees who are about to retire (see case studies 4 and 7 on the UK public healthcare provider and the Italian public university). Among retirees who are not employed, some of them would prefer to work if they were able to find suitable options. ESS (2010) data suggest that in Member States an average of almost one in two (47.9%) people aged 65 and over who do not have a paid job would enjoy having one even if in no need of money; this is especially the case for men. While this rate is lower than that among 14- to 54-year-olds (56.8%), it is similar to those aged 55 to 64 (47.4%). Many retirees thus have the desire to work but do not do so for various reasons. In the same 2010 survey, retirees (without paid employment, including retirees below 65) were also asked about the year they retired: ‘Did you want to retire then or would you have preferred to continue in paid work?’ On average, in each Member State, around one in four (25.8%) answered that they would have preferred to continue in paid work, with somewhat higher percentages among middle-income earners. The majority (67.4%) reported that they really wanted to retire. While this is not time series data, when comparing this rate (one in four) to the rate of people aged 65+ who do not work, but would like to (one in two), this suggests that a considerable share of retirees were happy with retirement initially, but would now wish to work. This might be because they want to work but not in the same job as before or because they needed a break but now wish to work for some reason. However, they have not found opportunities to leave retirement. While retirees are sometimes hired after a period of inactivity, it can be hard to find employment after having been dismissed or after having spent considerable time outside the labour market. The 50+ stay unemployed for a relatively long time. Reasons include age discrimination in recruitment behaviour (Arrowsmith and McGoldrick, 2001; Taylor and Walker, 1994), a lack of formal educational qualifications (Stoney and Roberts, 2003) and skill-biased technological change (Machin, 1995). Employers are less likely to hire retirees after they have spent a long time outside the labour market. While having been inactive or unemployed for a few months might not matter, it is likely to matter when lasting for 18 months or more (Karpinska et al, 2011). When older workers are aware of this, they may hang on to jobs even though they do not fit them perfectly just to avoid becoming unemployed. Furthermore, many unemployed older people move into ‘inactivity’ because they give up looking for a job and because work beyond retirement seems an unrealistic option for them even if they would like to. Work beyond retirement is particularly rare among those who were unemployed at retirement even after correcting for a large number of variables (Larsen and Pedersen, 2012). In five EU Member States reviewed (Hungary, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK), between 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 29 27% (UK) and 68% (Greece) of surveyed employers reported it to be undesirable for people to work beyond the age of 65, while the other employers reported it to be desirable or were indifferent (‘Fair play for older workers’ employer survey, cited in Van Beek et al, 2011). Many of the factors associated with insufficient demand for labour at younger ages are reproduced as predictors of unsuccessful re-entry into the labour force after an initial retirement. Women in particular appear to be disadvantaged in their ability to maintain a desired attachment to the labour force and evidence of this disadvantage persists even when pre-retirement job status and educational achievement are controlled for (Hardy, 1991). Opportunities depend on the retiree’s individual circumstances, which might restrict employment possibilities. In particular, health plays a role. Good self-assessed health seems to play an important role in this decision-making process (Ilmakunnas and Ilmakunnas, 2006). In a Dutch survey, among respondents who reported to have gone into retirement involuntarily, 27% reported to have done so because of their own health (Henkens et al, 2009). In 2011, 42% of Europeans believed that they would be capable of doing the work they were then doing beyond the age of 65 (European Commission, 2012b). This rate is somewhat higher if the threshold is set at 60, with 59% of European workers in 2010 expecting to be able to do their current job at that age, ranging from 40% in Portugal to 75% in the Netherlands (Eurofound, 2012). In particular, plant and machine operators and employees in elementary occupations reported that they felt unable to do their jobs at 60. This ability is highly dependent on working conditions, with exposure to ergonomic risk having an especially negative impact. Other work might not be what they are looking for or might not be accessible to them because of a lack of prior experience or unrealistic salary expectations triggered by rigid seniority wage systems. Furthermore, caring commitments, usually for an older partner but also for other older people or, increasingly, for grandchildren, restrict work options to those that permit sufficiently flexible work. Institutional arrangements such as company measures, government policies and collective labour agreements play an important role as well. These include public or private supporting services, age- adapted workplaces, anti-discrimination measures against older workers, flexible work arrangements and tax, social contribution and pension rules. These and other factors that can facilitate or hamper work beyond retirement will be discussed below in the chapters on government policies and company initiatives. Lastly, even if cultural norms do not discourage the individual retiree, they might still have an impact on their opportunities to work. A strong individual drive to work in a cultural environment where it is perceived not to be ‘normal’ or ‘acceptable’ to work beyond retirement restricts opportunities sometimes in subtle ways. For example, it was mentioned by an interviewee (see case study 13, the Dutch retiree job agency) that when retirees would enquire at the relevant institutions about consequences for their income if they continued working, they would often be met with an attitude of ‘why are you asking this, you should enjoy your retirement’. There could also be a feeling in society of ‘finding it sad to see older people working’, interpreting all such work as driven by need. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 30 Case study 4: UK public healthcare provider University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust Sector Public sector healthcare provider Employees 6,921 (301 retirees) Gender balance 80% female, 20% male (95% female versus 5% male for working retirees) The practice of encouraging employment continuation has been strengthened by the recession and subsequent recruitment freeze. It allows managers to retain their skilled workforce without incurring recruitment costs and without transgressing the freeze. From the retirees’ point of view, in the past they returned to work or continued working in order to ‘keep their hand in’, but now increasingly ‘they need to come back’ for financial reasons. There is a procedure in place to start combining occupational pension with continued work. Staff are required to complete a form that indicates whether they wish to continue working and whether they wish to either ‘wind down’ (work fewer hours or days) or ‘step down’ (move to a less demanding role). If staff continue working, they take a 24-hour break, return for one month on a 16 hour-a-week basis and then revert to full-time hours if preferred. A new contract is established. This is the most common route taken, as it allows staff to access their pension to gain their lump sum, which staff often want to use to pay off a mortgage while continued income is then used for living expenses. Almost all working retirees have a permanent contract (99% compared to 89% overall). Most retirees work in the same jobs as they did before reaching the retirement age, but sometimes start serving as a ‘float’ to fill in for sick leave and holidays or receive additional training to fulfil an adapted role. Most reduce their daily working hours and/or weekly working days. Among the working retirees, most work fewer than 30 hours (61% versus 30% overall). Often, such reductions cause increased workload for other members of the team. For those with caring responsibilities, three days of ‘emergency leave’ are available. Unpaid leave can also be taken and a flexible work solution negotiated with line managers. An interviewed retiree (68) works full time. In his free time, he is a drummer in two bands and runs half marathons. His asthma and arthritis are well controlled with medication, and he plans to continue working within the NHS at least until 70. ‘I didn’t feel ready to retire and I enjoy what I do [and] felt that I could still contribute. Working keeps me active and alert.’ Financial motivations are also important. The income ‘keeps us comfortable, not in a position where we can do as we please but in a position where we are not struggling for anything ... it’s only in the last few years that you could call my income reasonable. My previous job was low paid, I was a porter here for 20 odd years.’ His commitment to working is also evident from his enrolment in a French-style furniture painting course last year to ensure that, when he finally leaves the NHS, he has other skills to continue earning money and keeping active. Overall, this employee felt content that the Trust provides sufficient support. Should health problems emerge, he is aware of counselling, physiotherapy and occupational health services. He also feels welcome and wanted. The employee had been anxious that the employer might hand him his papers but ‘at no time did they put pressure on me to retire’. Characterising working retirees Age More than one of every 10 Europeans between 65 and 69 years old works (Table 4). While on the increase (from 4.3% in 2005 to 5.2% in 2011), it is half as common for those between 70 and 74 years old to work. It is rare for people aged 75 years or older to work in the EU, with only about one out of 100 in employment. There has been no notable increase in employment for this oldest age group over the past decade. Table 4: Employment rates (%) among retirees of different age groups in the EU, 2005 and 2011 65–69 years 70–74 years 75+ years 2011 10.5 5.2 1.2 2005 8.8 4.3 1.1 Source: Eurostat, LFS online database, 2012 Investigating self-reported retirement status rather than age gives an estimation of employment rates among retirees between 60 and 64 years old. Figure 6 shows these rates for the 13 EU Member States included in the SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe ) database. For all these countries, the proportion of self-reported retirees who report that they work is higher for 60- 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 31 to 64-year-olds than for 65- to 69-year-old reported retirees. Already in 2006–2007 in Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and Sweden, almost one of every three reported retirees in the 60- to 64-year- old age group reported that they work. Figure 6: Employment rates (%) for self-reported retirees in 13 EU Member States (2006–2007) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 I t a l y G e r m a n y I r e l a nd D e n m a r k A u str i a B e l g i u m S w e d e n P o l a nd G r ee c e C z e c h R e pub li c S p a i n F r a n c e 60–64 yrs 65–69 yrs 70–74 yrs 75+ yrs N e t h e r l a nd s % Source: SHARE, 2nd wave, 2006–2007 Gender It is more common for male retirees to do paid work than it is for female retirees (Table 5). To some extent this reflects lower employment rates among women in the population overall. Nevertheless, while it is almost twice as common for men aged 65 to 69 to work than it is for women of the same age group, this difference is smaller for 15- to 64-year-olds, while the situation for 50- to 64-year- olds is very similar to that of 15- to 50-year-olds. This suggests an abrupt change at retirement, with women much less likely to continue working. Reasons can lie in gender roles and norms with regard to the role of labour in one’s life, caring commitments and having older spouses. It should be noted, though, that in Member States with lower retirement ages for women than for men, the age-based measure ignores a group of younger female retirees who might well be working. For example, in the UK, until recently the retirement age for women was 60 and was 65 for men. This can explain the fact that of the 1.4 million workers above their respective state pension age in the fourth quarter of 2011, 39% were men and 61% were women. Furthermore, two-thirds of these women worked in low-skilled jobs, while among men, two-thirds worked in high-skilled jobs (ONS, 2012). This further suggests that there is a gender dimension for work beyond retirement rather than only a generational effect. Nevertheless, differences are decreasing in each age group. In particular, the employment rate of female workers in the 65–69 years age group increased by 0.9 percentage points between the third quarters of 2007 and 2011, compared to an increase three times smaller (0.3 percentage points) among men in the same age group. Rather than older women suddenly taking on employment, part of this trend can be explained by cohorts of working women moving to the next age brackets. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 32 Table 5: Employment rates (%) by gender, EU, 2007 and 2011 2007 Q3 2011 Q3 Men Women Difference Men Women Difference 65–69 years 13.2 7.0 –6.2 13.5 7.9 –5.6 < 65 years 15–64 years 73.2 58.6 –14.6 70.5 58.7 –11.8 50–64 years 65.2 47.4 –17.8 65.0 50.9 –14.1 Source: Eurostat, LFS online database, 2012 With regard to gender differences, there are large variations among Member States. While Portugal, Cyprus, Denmark and Ireland show large gender inequalities in employment rates among retirees, this is much less the case in Latvia, Spain, France and Romania. Together with a decrease in the gender difference itself, variance among EU Member States also decreased greatly over the past few years, stemming from the relatively sharp decrease in gender differences in countries that had larger gender differences in 2007. It is hard to say whether this reflects that the need to work became more equally divided among retirees of different gender, or whether it reflects equalisation of desire and opportunities to work. Some of the decreases can be explained by traditionally male-dominated sectors, such as construction, suffering more from the crisis. A clear example is Latvia, where the gender difference plummeted from among the highest in the EU to the lowest. This was not caused by increased uptake of work among female retirees, but by job loss among retired men. Education A relatively large share of highly educated people work beyond retirement (Table 6). Employment rates for those with medium-level education (lower and upper secondary) show the largest relative drop around retirement. In percentage points, the drop is largest for the highly educated, but that should be seen in perspective, with a particularly high employment rate among the highly educated overall. The drop for those with the lowest level of education (pre-primary or primary) is somewhat less marked. The superior employment rate for the highly educated could possibly be explained by a relatively strong interest to work beyond retirement, often in jobs that are physically light. Furthermore, options for continued employment might be more available and employers would be particularly keen to retain their highly educated employees, as their retirement sometimes implies skill loss. This could explain why their employment rate does not decrease so much at retirement as it does for those with medium-level education. On the other hand, for the lowest educated, most likely to be found in low-skilled jobs, with prolonged low earnings and little pension savings, the financial need to work is likely to explain their relatively high employment rate compared to those with medium education. It is interesting to note that those with medium-level education in particular have been taking up work after retirement more often over the past few years. Furthermore, while it is more likely for a retiree with tertiary education to be employed in retirement than it is for a retiree with non-tertiary education, it is important to see these relative data in perspective. In absolute numbers, working retirees with lower and medium education outnumber those with tertiary education. 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 33 Table 6: Employment rates (%) for different levels of education in the EU 2005 2010 15–64 years 65–69 years 15–64 years 65–69 years Low (pre-primary/primary) 47.4 8.4 45.1 8.2 Medium (lower or upper secondary) 68.2 8.9 68.4 9.6 High (tertiary) 82.5 18.2 82.3 18.0 Source: Eurostat, LFS online database, 2012 Interrelatedness of personal characteristics Naturally, several personal characteristics are interrelated, limiting the causal inferences that can be made based on the above-mentioned analysis, which was largely bivariate. A multivariate regression was performed 31 to predict whether someone aged 65 or older had worked for at least one hour in the week preceding the interview (or had a job or business). Explanatory variables included were age, gender, level of urbanisation (three levels) and level of education (three levels). Highly significant coefficients confirmed that increased age and being female have a negative impact on the likelihood of working after retirement. Living in more urban areas and having a higher education are associated with a higher likelihood of work after retirement. Characterising work after retirement Employed retirees are represented more in certain types of work compared to non-retired workers than in other types of jobs. The principal dimensions along which these differences can be measured are discussed below. Sectors More than one in four employed people aged 65+ in the EU works in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, compared to fewer than 1 in 20 employees aged between 15 and 64 years (Table 7). Employment in manufacturing, in contrast, is less than half as common among those aged 65+ than it is among the younger population cohort. The human health and social work activities and the wholesale and retail trade sectors are among the four most frequent sectors for employment. Professional, scientific and technical activities is the third largest sector for employment among people aged 65 and over, while it comes only eighth among those aged 15 to 64. In contrast, it is much less common for the 65+ age group to work in public administration and defence (2.9%) than it is for those aged 15 to 64 (7.2%). 3 Binary logistic regression analysis of 2009 LFS data; all coefficients are highly significant, even at a 1% significance level, both when the data are weighted and unweighted.

Source: Eurostat, LFS online database, 2012 The differences in employment rates within sectors between those aged 15 to 64 and those aged 65+ often do not seem to be just a gradual development of changing rates with ageing workforces. While rates for older people before retirement age are sometimes higher, or lower, than the rates for the population as a whole, this sometimes reverses for those aged 65+. For example, professional, scientific and technical activities is a less common sector for employment of 50- to 64-year-olds than for younger cohorts. Nevertheless, it gains in importance again among those aged 65+. This is also true for arts, entertainment and recreation and wholesale and retail trade. For human health and social work activities, transportation and storage, public administration and defence and education, a contrary development can be observed. These are more frequent sectors of employment among the 50 to 64 cohort than they are for the younger cohorts, but then become less important again among those aged 65+. Agriculture, forestry and fishing becomes somewhat more important among older people below 65, but then suddenly becomes very important among the 65+ age group, probably because they are much more likely to continue working after retirement. Manufacturing shows a similar pattern, but in the opposite direction. Construction and administrative and support service activities lose importance in employment in a more gradual way. Human health and social work activities and education are predominantly female sectors, but this is not true among retirees. Generally, it is less common for women to work after retirement than it is for men. The difference is particularly pronounced in human health and social work activities, where the share of female employees is almost 19% lower for those aged 65+ than it is for 50- to 64-year- olds. Differences are also large and sudden in wholesale and retail trade, professional, scientific and technical activities, education and administrative and support service activities. Nevertheless, in agriculture, forestry and fishing, there is a larger rate of female workers among the 65+ group than among younger cohorts, but only in the EU15. This is also true for construction, albeit up from a very low rate. The accommodation and food service activities sector shows little difference between age cohorts. 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 35 Company size Analysis of LFS 2009 data shows that workers aged 65 years and older are relatively likely to work for smaller organisations, with only 12.5% working in organisations with 50 persons or more ‘working at the local unit’, compared to 36.1% for employees of all ages together. Thus, while large companies have some advantages in recruiting retirees, such as scale effects on administrative issues and marketing (see case study 16 on the UK DIY and garden centre), one finds relatively many working retirees among employees of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The fact that the phenomenon of work after retirement is not limited to a small number of large companies is confirmed by evidence from other sources. For example, an Italian regional company survey indicates that in 2000, one in five companies reported that they employ retired people (PPE, 2006). Continuity from previous employment Many of the cases investigated for this study involve retirees who stay with the same company, doing tasks that are the same (see case studies 7 and 20 on the Italian public university and the Austrian graphics equipment company) or different, although in the same area (see case study 17 on the German engineering company), from those they did before retiring. Sometimes they also stop working in their main occupation but continue in a second job (see case study 21 on the Italian choir). Nevertheless, some cases concern workers who switch employer (see case study 2, the Italian supermarket), and with it often tasks as well (see case study 8, the Czech security company). Job agencies for retirees or for older workers play a role for this last group. Evidence from analysis of UK LFS 2011 data shows that about 15% of jobs held by retirees are ‘new’ jobs. The recent increase in work after retirement seems to have taken place mostly among retirees continuing with the same job, as the share of working retirees who were in new jobs decreased by 5% (from 20%) since 2001. Retirees working full time usually stayed in the same jobs, with only 8% reporting new jobs, indicating that if people changed jobs, it was mostly into part-time jobs. Managers and associate professionals also tend to stay in the same job, while retirees doing low-skilled work report a job change relatively often. Evidence from Italy shows that managers and supervisors tend to prolong their working life more than other workers, postponing retirement rather than re-entering the labour market after retirement, which is relatively hard for them (Quarta, 2008). A US study showed that if there was a change, it was somewhat more common to move to self-employment or to the service industry (Iams, 1987). Retirees who re-enter the workforce tend to find jobs of lower status than held previously (Jorgensen and Taylor, 2008; Taylor and Walker, 1998). Companies most likely to retain workers are those with high rates of older workers, as they would otherwise face problems because of a sudden exit of a large part of their workforce reaching the retirement age. Several of the case studies showed that companies especially retain employees with skills the company does not want to lose. They stay involved in work they were doing before. ‘Expert pools’ and temporary job agencies also draw on the specific skills of these workers. Nevertheless, sometimes high-skilled employees move to lower-skilled jobs (see case studies 11 and 13 on the Swedish senior job agency and the Dutch retiree job agency), and both lower-skilled and higher- skilled workers move to different areas of expertise (see case studies 13, 17 and 9 on the Dutch retiree job agency, the German engineering company and the Czech senior job agency). Overall, taking up employment while in retirement seems less common than continued work into retirement. While not a representative sample, the cases presented in this report support this conclusion, with retirement exits playing a relatively minor role. Even for someone who reported 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 36 having started a new job after retirement, it was practically continuous with the pre-retirement employment (see case study 2, the Italian supermarket). Nevertheless, some of the working retirees in the company cases were recruited when they were past retirement age, for example around one in four retirees working with the UK cooperative (case study 23) and all those who work through a Dutch retiree job agency (case study 13). For high-skilled employees in particular, a career gap can be associated with a decrease in employability. As discussed above, return to work after having been inactive (or unemployed) is particularly hard for older people, so it is not surprising that leaving retirement is relatively uncommon. Increased employment in the pre-retirement cohort due to policies aimed at discouraging early retirement is therefore likely to increase the uptake of work after retirement even further. Exit from retirement can occur because of the reasons mentioned above (Chapter 3, ‘Explaining working after retirement’). It can be unplanned. For example, income might be insufficient because of unexpected decreases in pensions or increased costs. Many individuals also have no clear idea about their post-retirement income, not even when they are close to retirement. Retirees might also realise they miss being in employment, for example because of the social reasons outlined above. Alternatively, they might have planned from the beginning for a break followed by renewed employment. Nevertheless, evidence from the US suggests that exit from retirement is usually anticipated (Maestas, 2010), but sometimes it is not (Maestas, 2004). People leaving retirement are more likely to change occupation than those who continue working after reaching the retirement age (Maestas, 2010). While a person can leave retirement at any time, US evidence indicates that it is most common within a few years after initial retirement. Furthermore, part-time employment is usually sought rather than full labour participation (Ruhm, 1990). The rate of exit from retirement at least five years after initial retirement has remained relatively constant at around one quarter of the retired population. Using 1992–2000 data, a relatively high exit rate from retirement was found among those retiring at younger ages, for example 36% among those retiring at ages 51 to 52 (Maestas, 2004). In the UK, the only EU Member State for which such data have been identified, one in five people over 50 – equivalent to 4.3 million people – who had retired have gone back into work (LV=, 2011). Of those who have gone back into work, 37% went back to work because they felt they were too young to retire and 32% missed being part of the working environment. For 30% it was financially related: 20% said it was a necessity, as their personal and/or state pension wasn’t enough to support them in their retirement, and one in 10 (10%) needed to go back to work to help continue financially supporting their family. However, going back into employment after retirement has given some over- 50s an opportunity to fulfil other ambitions. A fifth (19%) made a complete career change and 12% set up their own business. Many have chosen to go back to work in a role that requires fewer hours than before (27%) and 18% are doing a job that is less stressful than their previous job. Hours worked Part-time work is much more common among retirees than among the population as a whole in the EU (Table 8). This is true for every Member State and is not a reflection of an increased tendency towards part-time work among older workers in general. Among 50- to 64-year-old Europeans, it is only marginally more common to work part time than it is for 15- to 64-year-olds as a whole (20% versus 18.5%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2011). Nevertheless, for those aged 65+, the rate jumps to 56.8%. 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 37 Part-time work is not only more common for retirees, it also became much more so over the past few years compared to other age groups. Between the third quarters of 2007 and 2011, the prevalence of part-time work increased by 5.2% among those aged 65+ compared to an increase of only 1.1% for 15- to 64-year-olds, and even less for 50- to 64-year-olds. There is a gender difference: part-time work is more common among female employees than it is for male employees. Nevertheless, the difference is more marked for 15- to 64-year-olds (7.9% for men versus 31.1% for women in 2011) than it is for those aged 65+ (52.3% for men versus 64.3% for women). Furthermore, increases over the past few years for women have been relatively small, suggesting some convergence.

Income from work after retirement in the EU 38 When one looks at the mean hours of work as a more continuous measure of part-time work, there is an abrupt decrease around the age of 65 (Eurostat, 2009b). While this is true for all EU Member States, the change is more pronounced in some than in others. The difference is largest in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Romania, where employees between 65 and 69 work on average 11.5 hours less per week than those aged 55 to 64. Greece, Italy, Latvia, and Lithuania are the only Member States with a difference in working hours between these age cohorts of less than 3 hours per week. Working hours per week gradually decline further with age beyond 69, so that older retirees are not only less likely to work than younger retirees, but they are also more likely to work fewer hours. Overall, almost one out of every three retirees works less than 15 hours per week. One out of four works somewhat more, but still less than 32 hours. There is no significant cross-national correlation between the numbers of hours worked and the uptake of work after retirement. The number of working hours is consistently lower for women than for men, but the difference becomes somewhat less marked after retirement, especially among the older retirees. There is also some difference among occupations, with retirees classified as legislator or manager working relatively many hours, whereas those classified as clerks work few. In this respect, there are large differences between Member States as well. While retirees working in agriculture and fishing in Belgium, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Romania work on average well below 20 hours a week, they work on average 40 hours or more in Slovakia and the UK. The high prevalence of part-time work can be explained from two angles. On the one hand, part- time work allows workers to combine their jobs with care commitments and other activities, it allows them to continue working even when their health might not permit them to work full time and it can make work more enjoyable. As a consequence, part-time workers are more likely to continue working beyond the pension age. In fact, there is evidence that facilitating part-time work can cause a net increase in the total number of hours worked in the economy (Lachowska et al, 2008). On the other hand, it is relatively common for people to move from no employment, or from full-time employment, into a part-time job. Sometimes this is the case because no full-time work is available. Overall, work after retirement is increasingly common, and this work is largely part-time work. Simultaneous to this development, partial early retirement schemes are on the decrease. As a consequence, phased retirement – as a phenomenon rather than a programme – takes place more and more during retirement rather than before. Self-employment Self-employment is relatively common among employed retirees (Table 9). This is true for all Member States, but there are differences. Overall, about half of the retirees are self-employed in the EU. This compares to 14.3% for those aged 15 to 64. Differences in Portugal, Italy, Romania, Luxembourg and Ireland are particularly large, with the proportion of self-employed among those aged 65+ ranging between 45.0 (Ireland) and 69.6 (Portugal) percentage points above that among 15- to 64-year-olds. The difference is relatively small in Slovakia (6.4%). One-third (35.3%) of self-employed persons aged 65+ work in agriculture, but many also work in the wholesale and retail trade (12.7%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (11.8%).

Note: n.a. = not available Source: Eurostat, LFS online database, 2012; calculated by combining variables ‘lfsq_esgan2’ and ‘lfsq_egan2’ This high rate of self-employment among retirees can be explained from two angles. Firstly, it could be more likely for people who were already self-employed before retirement to work after their retirement than it is for others. Second, working retirees might have become self-employed after their retirement, more so than self-employed starting to work for an employer. The first group of self-employed retirees have various motivations. Self-employed people can be more likely to continue working because they did not accumulate enough of a pension. They are often required to make minimum contributions to pension schemes and do not always opt to put much more money aside in such arrangements. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 40 Another, related, reason is that self-employed people more often enjoy work than other groups of the population and never envisioned retiring at the statutory pension age, or retiring at all. In a 2011 survey (European Commission, 2012b), 46% of self-employed people in the EU indicated they would like to continue working after they reach the age when they are entitled to a pension. There are different types of self-employment. For those who own a company, particular reasons for continued work beyond retirement can play a role. Entrepreneurs have been reported to regard statutory retirement as an arbitrary time to stop working and make their retirement decisions in the context of more pragmatic issues, such as health and family considerations (Barnes et al, 2004). Furthermore, prospects for continuation of the company can play a role, as it could cease to exist if retirees stop working (see case study 5 on the Swedish self-employed consultants). Often these self- employed people hope to transfer the company to their children (Eurofound, 2013, forthcoming) and wait for them to be prepared to do so or stay at work to guide them when they take it over. Looming discontinuation of the company is a disincentive to stop working, especially when the retirees built the company themselves over a long period or when their parents did so. In 2009, 11% of self- employed Europeans aged 65 years and older had companies with more than 20 employees, while this was only 7.5% for 15- to 65-year-old self-employed people (8.9% for 55- to 65-year-old self- employed) (Eurostat, 2009b). A large responsibility can be felt by entrepreneurs towards the people they employ to avoid unemployment among them, which might result from discontinuation of the company due to retirement of the entrepreneur. In Germany alone, the number of firms transferred every year due to retirement of the owner has been estimated at 18,900, with 247,000 employees. The number of companies that are closed or liquidated because no successor has been found is unknown (Hauser et al, 2010). Especially for smaller companies, a barrier for smooth business transfer is the complexity of the business transfer process and potential lack of experience (and knowledge of support available) of the new owner (European Commission, 2011a). Case study 5: Swedish self-employed consultants Ledningskonsulterna i Stockholm Sector Consultancy (economic governance within the banking sector and inquiries and evaluations for public institutions) Employees (working retirees) 2 (2) The two employees, a wife (63) and husband (66), are both eligible for the statutory pension (from 61), but they do not receive any pension because they continued working. The company was founded in 1980, but the couple joined more than a decade later. The retired self-employed workers note three reasons that keep them in employment. The flexibility that is permitted by their project- based work is an important factor, allowing them to concentrate work in certain periods of the year and permitting them to work part time. Social relations with clients, and with the small consultancy companies they partner with, are a factor as well. Furthermore, the fact that permanent full retirement would imply termination of the company works as an inhibition to retire. For the second group (retirees who became self-employed after reaching the pensionable age), different mechanisms are at play. Various groups can be identified: those who became self-employed after their retirement because they wanted to for a long time, because they had no alternative, because it provides them with the most attractive working conditions or because of administrative reasons. Self-employed people who have wanted to be an entrepreneur for a long time might not have done so because of liquidity or family constraints. Retirement offers the opportunity to pursue their dreams. For other retirees, self-employment is a way to create working conditions that best fit their preferences. US research (Brown et al, 2010) indicates that they seek out jobs in workplaces that meet their needs and preferences, most notably a climate of respect, work–life balance, supervisor 
Characterising and explaining trends in work after retirement 41 task support and learning opportunities. If this type of workplace is not available, the opportunity to become their ‘own boss’ also appeals to working retirees. Other retirees have a hard time finding a job and see self-employment as the only way out. They might need and/or want to work but are confronted with a hostile labour market. Different motivations are related to various forms of self-employment (Singh and DeNoble, 2003). For example, retirees who become self-employed because there are no better career-related options available are expected to choose a form of self-employment that involves little to no entry barriers and that requires modest capital investments. Exposure to market and financial risks will be kept to a minimum since they will likely close their business as soon as other gainful employment opportunities become available. On the other hand, self-employed retirees who finally fulfil their long-held dreams, which they had not been able to pursue at an earlier stage of their lives for different reasons (‘constrained entrepreneurs’), are likely to be the most innovative, motivated entrepreneurs among retirees. Those who decided to become entrepreneurs because of a rational choice, comparing other available options with that of being self-employed, tend to plan carefully, for example by building their necessary business infrastructures before making the move. They tend to leverage who and what they know from their primary career experiences into some form of a related venture. Workers 50 and older who had been in ‘less than effective’ workplaces before they retired may seek out a work situation that is effective for them or they may decide to create one of their own. This desire to customise their workplaces may be one reason why a substantial number of employees 50 and older transfer to self- employment for their retirement jobs. As a result, it becomes understandable that those working in retirement are more likely to rate their workplaces as more effective compared to those who have not retired (Brown et al, 2010). But the main reason for positive workplace ratings among working retirees is that workers who did not like their workplaces are less likely to have continued working. In several Member States there is a considerable group of retirees for whom self-employment is mainly a contractual formality. In practice they are one-person companies who work for only one client, often the company they used to work for before reaching the pensionable age. Reasons are usually of a legal or financial nature, such as advantageous social benefit requirements or tax rates. For example, the large increase in self-employment in retirement in Italy can be explained partly by the incentive to hire retired workers through a flexible contract (called ‘co-co-co’), sometimes just changing the contractual arrangements for current workers who continue doing exactly the same work (see case study 7, the Italian public university). ‘Semi’ self-employment can imply low-wage, insecure work arrangements (Ball, 2012). Contract type Temporary contracts are relatively uncommon for 55- to 64-year-olds in the EU, with 6.7% of them having temporary work (Eurostat, 2009b). In contrast, EU employees aged 15 to 29 have a temporary contract in 29.4% of cases. While not as common as among the young, retirees are also on a temporary contract relatively often (17.8% of those aged 65+). It should be noted that in some Member States the high rate of temporary contracts among retirees is due to legal arrangements that come into force around pension age. For example, until 2009, in the Czech Republic the law only allowed simultaneous income from a retirement pension and employment for pensioners with fixed-term contracts of a maximum one-year duration. There is an important difference between the groups of temporary workers aged between 15 and 29 and those aged 65 and over. Young employees on a temporary contract are rarely in that position 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 42 because they do not want a permanent job (11.9%), while for those aged 65+, the vast majority of those with a temporary job say they do not want a permanent one (70%). Undeclared work Undeclared work happens in all EU Member States. It is notoriously hard to obtain reliable data on this topic. Survey respondents tend to be hesitant in reporting their undeclared work, and it would be hard to find employers – of retirees not working independently – willing to cooperate for case study research. Other methods have their limitations as well. Nevertheless, expert opinions and other scant available evidence suggest that, just as among other groups of the population, retirees sometimes do undeclared work. Financial incentives are mentioned as a key motivation and the administrative burden of tax declarations can play a role as well. The perceived chance of getting caught and the assessed severity of the consequences as compared to the benefits, as well as moral standing (if undeclared work is perceived to be common – differences among age cohorts might have developed historically in different countries), also play a role (see Eurofound, 2008a, for a more exhaustive discussion). Besides these more general motivations for undeclared work, retirees can have specific incentives and disincentives. For example, pensioners are usually covered by health insurance unrelated to their occupational status, so they do not need to declare their salaries in order to receive health care coverage (Leibfritz, 2011). Probably most importantly, they often have less or no need to accumulate additional pension years, which can be a great incentive to declare income from work. Furthermore, retirees are often not entitled to unemployment benefits, which can be subject to tight control, a factor that discourages undeclared work among non-retirees. In contrast, disincentives include the fact that in several Member States, pensioners are exempted from social contributions. Three groups that are most likely to do undeclared work are students, the self-employed and unemployed people (European Commission, 2007). Among the (self-reported) ‘retired, or unable to work’, 1% reported doing undeclared work. In comparison to 8% among the self-reported self-employed or to 3% among home workers, this rate seems low. Nevertheless, this is deceptive if one does not compare this 1% to the employment rate among retirees, which is lower than that of other parts of the population. A considerable share of work beyond retirement is thus undeclared. Furthermore, other categories reporting doing undeclared work (for example, self-employed) could include some retirees because of the measurement problems already discussed (Chapter 1, ‘Measuring work after retirement’). Overall, data suggest that undeclared work is at least as common among retirees as it is among other people in the EU, and could well be somewhat more prevalent. Table 10 gives an idea of the sectors where undeclared work among retirees can be found in the EU. These results have to be interpreted with care, as the sample sizes are sometimes small and specifying for countries would result in cells that obtain hardly any observations. Nevertheless, some very broad observations can be made as one additional exploratory element of the analysis in this section. Household services seems the most important sector of undeclared employment among retirees by far. Undeclared hotel, restaurant and café work seems almost absent among retirees, while it is common among youth. Undeclared retail work is more common among retirees. While to some extent this all reflects different employment rates among retirees in the different sectors, this is not always the case. Agricultural work is more common among retirees, but it seems to be less common to do this work without declaring it. One explanation could be that these retirees are mostly owners of their farms, and it can be relatively hard to do undeclared work for a company you are registered as owning.

Source: Eurofound analysis of Special Eurobarometer 284 (wave 67.3) microdata Expert opinions in the seven country reports as well as other publications (for example, Geroldi, 2000; Leibfritz, 2011; Széman, 2011) confirm the presence of undeclared work among pensioners and give an insight into the underlying reasons and type of work. Many workers, ‘especially the self- employed or those in service professions, continue temporarily part-time, part-week or part-year work while drawing pension or alternative social benefits’ (Reday-Mulvey, 2005, p. 93). Retired persons, for example, do not declare income from care for older people (sometimes abroad), crops sold from agricultural activity, working at public toilets or collecting coats in restaurants. For Italy, Spain, Portugal and France it has been reported that older craftsmen, farmers, nurses or consultants continue occasional work (Reday-Mulvey, 2005). Employment clusters In the EU generally, working retirees tend to be relatively young, male, do part-time work and work for SMEs. Furthermore, the better-educated are more likely to work after retirement, and it is much more common to be self-employed among retirees than it is among non-retirees. Nevertheless, it is not true that a typical working retiree fulfils all these criteria. In order to obtain a better idea of work after retirement in the EU, it is interesting to classify those who work after retirement into groups of people and jobs with similar characteristics. Cluster analysis of LFS (2009) data reveals five prominent clusters of work beyond the age of 65 (Table 11). Further specification would lead to dividing some of the clusters into two or collapsing subgroups of the different clusters into relatively small groups with common characteristics. Nevertheless, these five broad clusters serve the purpose of providing an illustrative impression. One cluster includes relatively old agricultural and fishery workers doing part-time work. More than half are female, but a large share is male. Such post-retirement workers can be found relatively often, for example, in Austria, Greece, Poland, Portugal and Romania. Two other clusters involve younger part-time retirees who do elementary work or work in services and sales (mostly female) or as technicians (mostly male). There is also a large group of highly educated retirees in urban 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 44 areas who work part time as professional employees but are also often self-employed. Most of them are male, but a large share is female. This group is relatively dominant, for example, in Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. Finally, there is a group of self-employed who work as managers or legislators or who are in crafts or trades. They are predominantly male. This group is particularly well represented, for example, in Belgium, Greece, Italy and Spain.

45 4 Government policies In the ‘Opportunities’ section in Chapter 3, broad mechanisms were discussed that might hinder or stimulate retirees to work. This chapter will discuss in more depth what governments can do to facilitate work for those who want to work, while Chapters 5 and 6 focus on company and retiree initiatives. Overall, it is important to realise that incentives aimed at the individual might miss their aim if opportunities are not provided and that line managers often have a large say (Vickerstaff, 2006). Labour market Governments can play a role by stimulating economic growth and the availability of suitable jobs. While these can facilitate work after retirement, they benefit other groups of society as well. The labour market has been particularly tough for older people who, for example, have been made redundant or who have been pushed into early retirement when they felt no desire to retire at all (Chapter 3, ‘Opportunities’). Governments can help by keeping older people close to the labour market, by facilitating training and ‘[avoiding] measures that may alleviate their unemployment in the short run, but compromise their potential employment in the longer run’ (European Commission, 2011a, p. 102). The Geneva Association stresses the need to promote part-time jobs (Giarini, 2009). Governments can facilitate this – and flexible work arrangements in general – in numerous ways. Regulations with regard to age-adapted workplaces can also help. An in-depth discussion of such measures goes beyond the scope of this research. As so many retirees are taking up self-employment because of the reasons discussed above, an obvious area for targeted labour market policy measures concerns facilitating self-employment. Many of them, such as diminishing administrative burdens, are as important for younger as for retired entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, some public measures are specifically aimed at retirees. For example, the EU-funded Bazaar project fosters self-employment among those aged 50+ (including retirees) by teaching them to create their own online businesses based on skills and experience they acquired during their life professionally or as their hobbies. Senior Enterprise is another EU-funded project that stimulates self-employment among older people more generally. Furthermore, it is important to realise that the status of being self-employed frequently hides the fact that many could be considered effectively employees (Chapter 3, ‘Self-employment’), often working in low-paid jobs under insecure conditions (Ball, 2012). Age barriers and discrimination Age discrimination is prevalent in the EU, both because people are perceived to be ‘too young’ and because they are considered ‘too old’. The age at which someone is considered ‘too old’ or ‘too young’ depends on the context and on the individual. Discrimination can happen at the workplace and in access to employment. In 2011, about one-fifth (21%) of EU citizens reported that they were discriminated against because they are perceived to be too old in the workplace or when looking for work (6%), or had witnessed such discrimination (15%) (European Commission, 2012b). Older workers who are less educated and less skilled report lower levels of discrimination than more educated and skilled workers (Eurofound, 2008b). Measures to combat age discrimination are important in facilitating work after retirement for those who want or need to work. In particular, it can positively impact recruitment levels of retirees, but it can also protect retirees from being driven out of an organisation at a certain stage – sometimes 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 46 well into retirement – because of their age. Such measures have been discussed in more depth in other studies. Nevertheless, this section focuses on some aspects that are of particular relevance for retirees. Retirement age A barrier faced by retirees who want to continue working is the fact that in several Member States, contracts are automatically discontinued when people reach the statutory retirement age. It is interesting to note that in a Member State with a retirement age of 65, dismissal purely based on age is illegal at, for example, 64, but discontinuation of the contract because of age is acceptable a year later. Some Member States passed legislation to increasingly protect the employment rights of those reaching retirement age. In 2011 the UK made it illegal to dismiss employees because they reached the retirement age, while in 2007 France prohibited redundancy because of age, including in occupational schemes with earlier retirement ages, up to the statutory retirement age of 65. The Netherlands and Germany, where permanent contracts are discontinued by default at the state retirement age of 65, have recently seen court judgements challenging the legitimacy of such discontinuation. Among respondents to a Dutch survey who reported having gone involuntarily into retirement, 13% reported doing so because of reaching the statutory retirement age (Henkens et al, 2009). The most important reason (cited by 77%), though, was pressure from the employer or colleagues or both. Research suggests the impact of anti-age discrimination legislation to be particularly strong in the way in which it prevents employers from organising employment exit around fixed retirement ages while at the same time enhancing people’s expectations of, and claims to, continued employment (Lain, 2011). A greater UK concentration in occupations with low pay and low qualifications required suggests employers, working in a context of limited employee rights, selectively retained and recruited people in their sixties to these jobs. An alternative explanation – that these employment levels reflected the characteristics of those choosing to work – was unsupported. The evidence suggests that the 2011 UK default retirement age abolition will weaken ‘low pay, low qualifications’ occupational segregation after 65 more than voluntary commitments to ‘age diversity’ (Lain, 2012). Besides legal arrangements, country differences in the institutionalisation of a retirement age and its normative influence can explain differences in uptake of work beyond retirement (Scherger et al., 2012, forthcoming). This is also – at least partly – in the hands of governments. Are retirees competing with non-retirees for scarce jobs? Six out of 10 EU residents think people should be allowed to continue working past the official retirement age, and more than half reject the idea of a compulsory retirement age (European Commission, 2012b). Nevertheless, there are large differences across Member States. In particular, citizens in countries with high youth unemployment rates tend to be more hostile toward work beyond retirement (Figure 7a), as are (though somewhat less) people in countries with high unemployment rates among the population aged 25 and over (Figure 7b).

In line with this way of thinking, assuming that the exiting person has been in employment for a long time and has been able to build up an adequate pension, it could also open up jobs for older people who have been outsiders for a long time and who need to accumulate more pension for their income to be adequate once they retire. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 48 On a micro, day-to-day level, it is hard to claim that there is never any trade-off. Retiring workers sometimes make way for a younger generation. Many of the working retirees in the case studies in this report do jobs that younger people could do as well. Furthermore, if an older employee stays longer, the employer might feel less urgency to look for younger alternatives and for possibilities to train them. Nevertheless, it is hard to find macro-level evidence that such arguments hold in the long run. To the contrary, there is a significant positive cross-national correlation between employment rates among younger workers and employment rates among older workers. Low unemployment among all age groups seems likely to be a consequence of a healthy economy and labour markets that are functioning well. Nevertheless, even after removing the impact of such variables, high employment rates among the old have been argued to be positively associated with high employment rates among the young (for example, Brugiavini and Peracchi, 2008). It is clear that the labour market is not a zero-sum game. Otherwise, high birth rates would be of great concern for the currently employed, who will not have reached retirement age when these new- borns reach working age. The move of baby boomers into the labour market in the late 1960s would have left many 30- to 40-year-olds unemployed, and the uptake of work by a large number of women over the past decades would have made an equal number of men unemployed. In this regard, it is interesting to note that about half of working retirees are self-employed. While salaried employees can generate employment for others as well, this certainly also applies to the self-employed, especially for those who create their own successful companies. Even if in the short run working retirees can create opportunities for non-retirees by leaving their jobs, it should be noted that there are societal costs associated with someone moving into retirement in many of the EU pension systems where the younger population funds current pensions. Furthermore, retirees often have connections with others, particularly family, that have an economic effect. If they do not work, they might draw on support from younger relatives, and vice versa – they sometimes work to support their children (see case studies 1 and 2 on the German newspaper and Italian supermarket in Chapter 3). Old and young workers are sometimes competing for different jobs, but this argument is not as valid when comparing retired workers with non-retired older workers. Besides, (early) retirement has often been used as a relatively painless way to downsize the labour force rather than to hire younger employees. To avoid this, the Spanish government has a national policy in place where between 61 and 64 years it is possible to combine partial pension receipt and a part-time job if working hours are reduced between 25% and 75%, and another employee must replace the remaining working hours left by the partial pensioner (OECD, 2011). While there is no macro-level trade-off between the employment of younger and older workers, it is important not to ignore contrary perceptions. Policymakers, especially in countries with high unemployment, might well feel societal pressure for policies that discourage retirees from continuing to work. The ideal would be to fight these perceptions, but this has proven to be hard, and there are options that are less likely to be controversial. Overall, good labour market policies benefit all generations. Intergenerational tensions are more likely to emerge in times of crisis (see case study 6, the Czech government ministry). In economic prosperity, given the demographic developments, labour market shortages are expected to be more of a concern. Furthermore, governments can address the financial need to work among retirees (see the ‘Avoiding need’ section). Lastly, work after 
Government policies 49 retirement can be facilitated in particularly beneficial ways. In particular, retirees can be involved in training and mentoring, moving into part-time working arrangements at retirement (see case study 17, the German engineering company). In this way, they can facilitate the integration of younger workers into specific jobs and contribute to addressing skills mismatches, with the current contradiction of available vacancies in conjunction with unemployment. Seniority wages Another important topic related to age barriers is the existence of seniority wages. Wage increases based on seniority rather than performance risk inequalities in remuneration among otherwise similar employees purely because of their age. As a consequence, employers can be expected to be relatively reluctant to continue the employment of older workers and avail of the ‘retirement option’ to bring wages in the organisation as a whole in line with productivity. Hiring older workers can also be inhibited by seniority wages. There are large differences between countries and organisations in the role of seniority wages (Moreira et al, 2010). While establishments with steeper seniority wage profiles than the average establishment in their sector can keep their employees longer, they hire fewer older employees. Future prospects of high wages can motivate younger employees to endure relatively low wages. Naturally, this incentive works better in organisations with high job security. The public sector is a good example where seniority wages are prevalent. Work after retirement is relatively less common in this sector, and in one of the case studies intergenerational tensions were mentioned as being fuelled by perceptions related to this (see case study 6, the Czech government ministry). Seniority wages can be argued to be more of an issue before retirement, as after retirement employees have been reported to accept lower wages (see case study 7, the Italian public university). Case study 6: Czech government ministry Ministry of Defence Sector Central state body responsible for the country’s defence, its military forces and its military territories Employees Central offices: 455 soldiers and 1,016 civic employees Overall: 21,202 soldiers and 8,241 civic employees Professional soldiers are automatically discharged when they reach the age at which they start obtaining retirement rights. While they are entitled to requalification courses, it is hard to find work elsewhere after being discharged. The Ministry of Defence can employ some of them, partly to compensate for contractual restrictions these retirees faced during their active service (for instance, in freedom of political participation), but also because of their extensive experience, practice and perspective. These retirees also require less training than younger colleagues. On the other hand, HR reports higher frequency of sickness. Because wages are partly based on the number of years worked and because retirees are frequently in relatively high positions, wages of working retirees are generally higher than those of younger colleagues. Cuts in employment because of austerity measures in the context of the economic crisis triggered some intergenerational tensions, according to HR and working retirees. Two interviewed working retirees, in middle and top management, reported working unlimited hours (reported to be typical at this level) and a 40-hour work week, both with flexible work arrangements, including work from home. Main motives are self- actualisation, personal worth and influence on public affairs. Institutional framework Sometimes labour legislation has been implemented without working retirees in mind. In the Netherlands, for example, workers are protected by prohibiting the conversion of permanent into temporary contracts within three months after termination of the permanent contract. For a group of workers whose contract is discontinued because of reaching the statutory retirement age but who agree with their employers to continue working, this has the practical consequence that they are often dismissed and then rehired after three months on a temporary contract. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 50 In EU Member States, employers are usually liable for covering their employees’ sick leave. Nevertheless, they can insure themselves for a prolonged period of sick leave. In some Member States (such as the Netherlands), a major barrier to work after retirement is that it is particularly hard for employers to obtain such insurance for working retirees. Governments could facilitate this by means of anti-discrimination legislation, by facilitating insurance policies for working retirees or by contributing to sickness allowances. As will be described below, the social partners have taken initiatives as well. Financial incentives Tested pensions Public pensions are sometimes means-tested (Table 12), with income being fully or partly retained from pension benefits. This implies a disincentive to work (or save), induces people to work less than they would like to or stimulates them to get involved in undeclared work. In the UK, benefits are partly means-tested. After taking health, education and age into account, being in the poorest quintile still reduces the probability of working after retirement (Lain, 2011). As the poorest are the only ones benefiting from this UK scheme, if their means keep beyond a certain level, this suggests that means-tested benefits indeed discourage employment. It should be noted that, if restricted to the poorest, this disincentive to work might protect them from the harsh labour market they face. They are relatively often in bad health and few employment options are available. Accessible jobs are often of low quality (see case study 1, the German newspaper in Chapter 3). Other EU Member States where such disincentives can be found include Austria, Belgium and, for early retirement pensions, the Czech Republic and Germany. Combining income from work with pension In most EU Member States (except Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands), public pensions can be deferred beyond the standard statutory retirement age for a limited or unlimited period (Table 12). Subsequently, additional accruals are earned over these years so that a higher pension will be received when the retiree decides to start drawing from it. In some Member States this accrual rate is particularly high (also compared to pre-statutory retirement age accruals) and there are no limits to the period over which the pension can be deferred. Nevertheless, evidence from the UK (see case study 4 on the UK public healthcare provider) suggests that retirees who choose to work do not always use this deferral option, however attractive it might be. The rate of working retirees who receive no pension is very low, suggesting that most people opt to receive the pension besides their income and then receive a lump sum payment after they stop working, for example to pay off debts (see case study 4 on the UK public healthcare provider). It should be noted that in Member States with a deferral option, some groups are excluded from this option, such as civil servants and judges in Hungary. Furthermore, some Member States only allow it if income is high enough (in Malta, for instance, if income is above the national minimum wage) or the number of hours worked is above a certain threshold (for example, Denmark has a threshold of 1,000 annual hours). Sometimes there is a minimum deferral period (such as 90 days in the Czech Republic).

The state pension (contributory) is not subject to an earnings test for regular pension. Italy Yes (until 70) 5.62% No limits. Nevertheless, disability allowances, for example, are cut progressively if annual income is above €23,826.40 and survivor’s pensions if income is above €18,229.77.

No limit, but for three years after pension not allowed to work in the same company/group as before pension (sanction: fine and mandatory choice between pension and work). Romania No - No limits, but only allowed to combine pension and work if pension is lower than the gross average salary (RON 2,117 or €463 per year). Slovakia Yes 6.5% No limits. Slovenia Yes After minimum pension age: Additional years of insurance up until full pension age attract a higher accrual rate. After full pension age: In the 1st year, monthly 0.3%, 2nd year 0.2%, 3rd year 0.1%. Maximum: 7.2%. Some limitations. Spain Yes 2%, 2.75% and 4%, respectively, for careers below 25 years, between 25 and 37 years, and over 37 years. Before 65: Pension benefit reduced according to the length of the working day. 65+: No obligation to replace the remaining working hours. Sweden Yes Automatic actuarial adjustments. No additional pension rights can be accrued after age 65 for the occupational pension. No limits. United Kingdom Yes 10.4% (or a taxable lump sum of the deferred pension plus interest – choice made when pension claimed). Pension credit is reduced by full income receipt, as long as income is below the threshold. Pension credit guarantees income of GBP 137.35 (€168.77) per week (GBP 209.70 (€257.72) for couples, with supplements for some groups, such as disabled, carers). Source: Based on OECD (2011), Holzmann and Guven (2009), EU (2011), MISSOC (2012), Scherger et al (2012, forthcoming) as well as input by Sonia de Paz Cobo (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos) and own research by Eurofound Several Member States have moved in the direction of systems where deferral is possible and additional accruals make it attractive to work beyond retirement, or where earning income besides receiving a pension is made a more attractive option. For example, in Finland, from 2004 the national pension can be deferred after the age of 65 and the pension is then increased by 0.6% for each month by which retirement is postponed (decreased to 0.4%, an annual 4.8%, since 2005). Alternatively, from 2005, it also became possible to take the old-age pension while earning income from work and accruing additional pension rights (at an annual 1.5%) until the age of 68 (OECD, 2011). While in Belgium deferral was already possible for people working in the private sector, it has recently become an option for civil servants as well. While there are many other factors at play in determining the rate of retirees who work, it is interesting to note that Belgium, a country where deferring public pension is unattractive (as no increments are obtained) and where income after retirement is deducted (partly) from pension benefits, has among the lowest (reported) employment rates in the EU27 among 65- to 69-year-olds (4.1% in 2010) (Table 1). In Member States where private occupational pensions play a major role, the incentives in these schemes also matter, according to the lines described for the public pension. For example, in Spain, several private pension funds do not allow their clients to start receiving their pensions if they continue working. 
Government policies 53 Employer and employee social security contributions Besides additional pension accrual and impact on pension receipt, social contributions matter as well. For example, in Luxembourg it is not possible to defer public pensions and accumulate additional pensions, but employment still provides additional income and, for those working beyond retirement, social contributions are refunded at the end of the year. In the UK, those working beyond the statutory pension age are exempt from paying national insurance contributions. In other Member States, such as the Czech Republic and Italy, employee and employer social security contributions (to health insurance, public pensions and so on) are still to be made by post-retirement workers. A 2004–2007 pilot scheme in Italy offered workers the possibility to postpone retirement by three years. Pensions would remain unchanged, but while in employment, they would be exempt from social security contributions. Their income would increase by an amount equal to 32.7% of their gross salary: the sum of the worker’s contribution to social security schemes (8.7%) plus the employer’s contribution (24%), without any added taxation. While some showed interest, it was relatively unattractive to employers, and mainly employees with high incomes would benefit. Favourable taxation regimes Taxation policies also matter. If income on top of pensions (if not deferred) is heavily taxed, retirees will be less likely to take on paid employment. Taxation can also stimulate people to defer pension receipt (and thus stimulate them to continue working to obtain income). An example includes a proposed Belgian occupational tax system reform. In particular, if workers take their occupational pension as a lump sum at the age of 60, the part accrued by employers’ contributions will be taxed at a flat rate of 20%, where it is currently taxed at 16.5%. However, if workers wait until they are 61, the rate will be 18%, it will 16.5% at age 62 to 64, and will go down to 10% at age 65 (IPE, 2012). As with social contributions, there are also tax incentives that affect employers. For example, employers in Sweden have been exempt from payroll taxes for all employees over the age of 65. Case study 7: Italian public university University of Camerino Sector Public sector university Employees 1,100, of which 10 are retirees Gender balance 40% female, 60% male (50% female versus 50% male for working retirees) All 10 working retirees are full-time professors with flexible temporary contracts and figure as ‘self-employed’. They all have a university degree (there are also 15 retired professors doing unpaid voluntary work.) One of the working retirees was offered a proposal by the university to retire at the age of 62, when he became entitled to a public (seniority) pension (i.e. the main Italian early retirement scheme). He received a contract for eight years, until 70, the statutory retirement age for university professors. The remuneration by the university amounts to 30% of what he used to receive, but by adding this to the pension, overall he earns more while his tasks and work content remain unchanged. The number of professors employed by the university is very important, as it determines the number of degree courses the Ministry entitles the university to provide. The university saves 70% on salaries by offering professors the above-mentioned agreement. Nevertheless, retired professors (paid or unpaid) will not be counted anymore by the Ministry in a new law that will soon be implemented. Other financial incentives Financial incentives affecting the supply of labour can also stem from decreased costs because of access to services. For example, lack of health benefits in retirement can discourage workers from leaving the labour force. This particular issue is especially relevant in the US, where most citizens 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 54 receive health benefits from their employers and the loss of these benefits can substantially raise the cost of retiring (Johnson, 2004). Nevertheless, it is important to keep such benefits in mind in policymaking in the EU. Subsidies can also play a role. If a company receives a state payment for employing disabled people, this can disproportionally incentivise them to employ groups that have disabilities. As the likelihood of having a disability increases with age, retirees are among these groups. Nevertheless, in several Member States such subsidies only apply to employees below the pension age (see case studies 8 and 12 on the Czech security company and the Polish cleaning company), providing a strong disincentive to hire disabled retirees. Case study 8: Czech security company Agentura Pancé ř Ltd Sector Services in the fields of security, protection of property and persons, real estate management and maintenance, and agency work for people with disabilities. Employees 1,005, of whom 985 with permanent contract (65 retirees, 45 with permanent contract) Gender balance 22.4% female, 77.6% male (7.7% female versus 92.3% male among working retirees) As part of a national policy, the company receives a public subsidy (CZK 8,000 per month) for each disabled person it employs. When any of the 815 disabled employees with a permanent contract reaches the retirement age, the subsidy is discontinued. The company usually keeps retirees for about one year after their retirement and then terminates the contract. It attempts to retain the best- performing workers on permanent contracts. The security agency also hires retirees, mostly former staff, for short-term jobs. These retirees replace staff who are absent, for example, due to illness, or answer to a short-term need for more workers. They often work as doorkeepers and receptionists for the agency’s clients. One of the employed retirees used to work as an X-ray operator in the field for which she studied. When she retired, she started to work for the security agency as a cashier. She holds the upper secondary degree that was required for this position. She works part time, for 30 hours per week. The main reason for employment is that the public pension does not allow her ‘a decent living in the capital city’. Furthermore, it helps to fulfil her continuous need for self-actualisation, to be in contact with people and to maintain a clear mind. Her satisfaction is boosted by working in a nice team, being respected by her co-workers personally and professionally and by not encountering the intergenerational pressure and age discrimination she encountered elsewhere in the labour market. Information provision Besides actual legislation, information provision also matters. It was a common observation in the case studies that employers and employees had no clear idea about the regulatory framework surrounding work after retirement, including the consequences for pension receipts (see case studies 2, 10 and 13 on the Italian supermarket, the Polish ship R&D centre and the Dutch retiree job agency). In such a context, tax and benefit rules have an unknown impact and employers can be hesitant about employing a retiree, while retirees can be hesitant about taking up work because they are unsure what the financial and administrative consequences are. For example, a recent (2008) change in Danish law allowing retirees to earn up to about DKK 30,000 (approximately 4,000 on 16 October 2012) per year without any deduction in their supplementary pension had little impact on employment rates, partly because many retirees do not know about the regulation (Larsen and Ellerbæk, 2012). Information gaps were also identified as one of several barriers in a Dutch study on work after retirement (AStri, 2006). Governments can do something, firstly by designing simple systems. Furthermore, they can stimulate the dissemination of information. An example includes a Dutch website (www.65pluswerkt.info) that informs employees who are considering working after their retirement and employers considering hiring retirees. 
Government policies 55 Avoiding need Ideally, nobody should have to work beyond retirement age to make ends meet. Governments can play a role in avoiding this. In ensuring future pension adequacy and long-term financial sustainability of pensions systems, maximising employment years and minimising the effects of career breaks is crucial. This entails raising employment rates and pension coverage – notably for the youth and women – for example by crediting involuntary career breaks and increasing the effective retirement age, including by tightening early retirement pathways and enhancing conditions and incentives for older workers to work longer and finding ways to adapt pension rights to developments in life expectancy. (European Commission, 2011a) However, even when a financial safety net is in place, unawareness among retirees can produce inadequate income, with the lower-educated being particularly at risk. For example, in England, 4 million people are entitled to pension credit, guaranteeing a basic income (see Table 12). Nevertheless, one in three of these pension credits go unclaimed. Governments can make benefit systems more proactive and user friendly. Ideally, systems would be well designed and there would be no need for information provision. In practice, though, enhanced access to information provides a (second-best) solution. Besides government information services, there are NGOs that help pensioners claim their benefits (such as A2B in Belfast). 

57 Company initiatives Motivation for companies The case studies focused on organisations that employ retirees. As a consequence, there is a selection bias, with all these organisations likely to see a ‘business case’ in employing retirees. While this limits potential analysis of whether there is an overall business case, it permits investigation of these companies’ motivations. Firstly, several of the case study organisations mentioned the importance of a diverse workforce, with being retired or not listed among one of the specific dimensions of diversity, beyond, for example, age as such. Diversity can be beneficial internally for the work environment (see case study 10 on the Polish ship R&D centre). More often, though, when speaking about the importance of employing retirees more specifically, reference was made to the client base. It was frequently judged important for the composition of the workforce to be similar to that of (potential) customers, to make clients feel more ‘at home’ and to better understand clients’ preferences (see case studies 9, 16 and 19 on the Czech senior job agency, the UK DIY and garden centre and the UK warranties provider). Case study 9: Czech senior job agency Q4work, part of TRISYSTE Member States Ltd Sector Brokering work for seniors and people with disability Employees 5, of which 2 working retirees Gender balance 80% female, 20% male (100% female among working retirees) All employees have upper secondary or higher education and work part time. The founder of the company reports being interested in hiring retirees because they better communicate with people of a similar age and status and they best understand customers’ needs. This is important for a company that brokers work for senior workers. Furthermore, the founder finds retirees to be loyal and less in need of training because of extensive knowledge. Flexible working hours, part-time working arrangements and allowing for more frequent absences from work (for medical check-ups, for example) were mentioned as ways to attract and retain retirees. Secondly, companies that are looking to fill positions in need of flexibility, for example to adapt quickly to changing demand for the companies’ services, find that retirees cater willingly for their needs. Retirees often accept, and may even prefer, temporary contracts, part-time work, irregular workloads and on-call shifts. The same holds for fee-for-service based payments or project-based contracts. They also are sometimes more willing to work unpopular shifts, especially when having no dependents (see case study 19, the UK warranties provider). Third, some collective agreements do not cover retirees and certain legal arrangements do not apply to retirees. Such gaps can form barriers, but sometimes they also bring advantages to companies. There are large differences among sectors, but as mentioned in the previous chapter, retirees are often cheaper and easier to fire and minimum wages do not always apply to them. Fourth, because retirees usually have some income from pensions, they sometimes accept relatively low payments (see case study 1 on the German newspaper in Chapter 3). Another reason for this is that they relatively often work for non-financial reasons. Fifth, it is often cheaper to keep a retiree (potentially on reduced hours) than to attract a new person, as they are in need of little training (see case study 9, the Czech senior job agency). When many baby boomers simultaneously retire, such continued employment also avoids loss of skills. Regardless of unemployment, specific sectors and companies are struggling to find people to fill vacancies. To avoid eventual skill loss, retirees were reported to either mentor younger colleagues part time to help them develop or informally exchange knowledge (see case study 10, the Polish ship R&D centre), 5 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 58 while in other cases retirees gave collective training (see case study 1, the German newspaper in Chapter 3). The case studies show that a shortage of labour with certain expertise has induced companies to overcome obstacles, but – somewhat counter-intuitively – the economic and financial crisis has done so as well in some occasions. The increased need to decrease costs triggered some of the examined organisations to retain workers, as it would avoid recruiting and training costs. Furthermore, in one of the public sector organisations examined (see case study 7 on the Italian public university), a hiring freeze in the public sector had the impact of enhanced effort in retaining retirees. Massive early retirement as part of downsizing, or as avoidance of further pension cuts, has also led to some enhanced public sector post-retirement employment as a compensatory arrangement or to fill gaps (as in Ireland, for instance). Lastly, social motivations were also mentioned. Employers reported that they knew of the difficult financial situation of the respective retiree and by giving access to work they helped them to gain some additional income to allow for a decent living (see case studies 2, 6 and 20 on the Italian supermarket, the Czech government ministry and the Austrian graphics equipment company). Case study 10: Polish ship R&D centre Centrum Techniki Okr ę towej Sector Publicly owned (Ministry of Treasury) joint-stock company: ship design and research centre, with research and development in water-borne transport and shipbuilding. Employees 140 permanent and 20 contract bases (10 retirees) Gender balance 31% female, 69% male Most employees (60%) are highly educated. On average, they work around five years beyond retirement. Nevertheless, due to recent perceived uncertainties about the possibilities to combine paid work and pensions, many people chose to leave the labour market when reaching the statutory retirement age. Retirees usually work part time or with flexible working time with a permanent or temporary contract. The type of the employment and time distribution depend on the company’s current and future needs as well as the willingness of the individual employee. Health status and family aspects are taken into account. A success factor is that there are clear descriptions of requirements, i.e. tasks, duties, evaluation criteria, availability of the retiree in light of working time (hours, working days). The company seeks to retain retirees who can take on the role of consultants or mentors in order to secure competences. The interviewed retiree was retained as the loss of his skills in hydromechanics would have implied a loss of competence for the company. For the employer, advantages of continued employment for retirees have been to secure the continuation of functions that otherwise would indicate drastic changes, the possibility of introducing flexible forms of employment and costs savings. Moreover, it assures a workforce that balances youth and maturity. These aspects are both noted as creating added value, such as enhanced professional ethics, natural exchange and transfer of knowledge. Negative aspects of employing retirees were also mentioned, such as conservative attitudes, objection towards changes and gaps in competences related to computer-based knowledge and language skills. For the employee, motivation includes work satisfaction (especially when working many years in the same company), lifelong learning (knowledge and skills), a social dimension (being with colleagues, friends), contributing to the company development and success, and healthcare benefits and other financial benefits. The interviewed working retiree stressed that activity keeps him up to date with engineering knowledge and allows him to be with other people who are interested in the same area of competence. An important role is played by institutions that promote the temporary placement of retirees in certain companies. Temporary job agencies are among them. Some job agencies seek to recruit older workers in general, and retirees form an important share of them (see case study 11, the Swedish senior job agency). Other job agencies explicitly recruit retirees (see case study 13, the Dutch retiree job agency). Employment through these agencies is in a broad range of jobs, but frequently low skilled. Other agencies explicitly focus on the expertise of high-skilled older workers, mostly retirees who want to do specific assignments (see case study 24, the Austrian business consultancy). 
Company initiatives 59 Case study 11: Swedish senior job agency Seniorjobbarna Sector Temporary job agency for older people Vacancies involve work such as household work and gardening work. Usually tasks are somewhat lower skilled than those of the retirees’ previous work. Retirees who are employed through Seniorjobbarna report motivations such as wanting to do good, to be needed and to retain a social network, but (secondary) financial reasons were also reported. Institutional facilitators considered important by the company and retirees include benefit tax rebates on household work and, more specifically, on retirees’ payroll taxes. Another group of companies mainly seeks to provide incentives to current workers to retain them after they retire (see case study 10 on the Polish ship R&D centre). Companies that are especially eager to retain retirees include those that work in sectors with high proportions of workers approaching retirement, especially when they are high skilled, high performing and hard to replace. These efforts tend to depend on market demand for particular services of the company. The case of Kodak in Austria (case study 20) shows how complex the dynamics can sometimes be. On the one hand, the company seeks to motivate employees to take early retirement in order to hire younger personnel with new technical skills, but on the other hand it stimulates work after retirement for some. Other companies recruit retirees for specific tasks. Sometimes this is part of a broader strategy, based on the business case arguments mentioned above, of explicitly searching for retirees. In other instances, it just refers to the occasional employment of a few retirees (see case study 12, the Polish cleaning company). Case study 12: Polish cleaning company Euroclean Sector Cleaning services and import and distribution of cleaning equipment, accessories and chemicals Employees 150 (1 retiree) Euroclean hires partially disabled people on temporary contracts, benefitting from the State Fund for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled. Several of these employees used to be retirees. No particular working conditions were offered to retirees, but generally good communication between younger and older employees contributed to a good working atmosphere. Retirees recently became exempted from this scheme and the company does not hire them anymore. Nevertheless, the company employs one retiree in the Human Resources and Wages Department. She is eight years older (68) than the statutory retirement age for women and was recruited as a retiree in a customary recruitment process. Before reaching retirement age she was working in a different company. Thus, she has returned to the labour market after some time of full retirement without paid work. She applied for the job as an accountant focusing on salaries and work regulations, which is her area of expertise. She works full time on a permanent contract. The retiree is satisfied with working past retirement age and stresses the need for positive ‘adrenaline’ in order to be able to keep up with the work and to cope with the working environment. Therefore, she hopes to continue to work as long as possible. The main incentive for the employee is to stay occupied, i.e. to not get isolated and inactive. This aspect may be related to the importance of being able to work. Another crucial factor, on the financial side, is to have the possibility to obtain additional salary to guarantee adequate income. Facilitating by informing There is often a mismatch between what employers think their employees want and what the employees actually want. The opposite is also true – retirees also hold expectations about what their employers can offer and what they cannot. While such mismatches can occur in many situations, there are particularly strong presumptions attached to retirement. In the case studies it was reported that retirees sometimes think ‘employers might not need them anymore’ and that ‘colleagues would not welcome working retirees’ (see case study 13 on the Dutch retiree job agency). When employers were asked in a US survey which of a number of options they thought their employees were interested 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 60 in during retirement, answers differed greatly from what employees actually reported. For example, while 21% of responding employees reported they would never work for pay again, employers thought this would apply to 45% of workers. Employers also thought that more of their workers would wish to work part time in retirement than to go back and forth between leisure and work, while employees attached more importance to being able to move back and forth between work and leisure than to work part time during their retirement. Retirees can also refrain from expressing their desire to work because they assume certain work options are not meant to be for them (see case study 19 on the UK warranties provider). To change such views, employers can use well-designed PR through specific media (for example, certain radio stations or local newspapers) that are most likely to reach retirees. Furthermore, several of the cases raised the issue that retirees were unsure about the consequences for their finances of additional income (Chapter 4, ‘Information provision’). This can prevent them from taking up work. As mentioned above, governments can play a role here, but so can companies. Pre-retirement counselling can be used as a tool. When recruiting retirees, such information can also be provided as a way to attract them (see case study 13, the Dutch retiree job agency below). Case study 13: Dutch retiree job agency Pittig Sector Private, for-profit temporary job agency for retirees Pittig, established in 2011, has one office in Amsterdam, aiming for national coverage with its internet site. Its founder was inspired by his mother (a physiotherapist) who wished to work in retirement but felt society might not need her anymore. He encouraged her, and she now works in promotion. There are several temporary job agencies in the Netherlands that focus on older workers and early retirees (Oudstanding, Rvaring, 50+ Carrière). Pittig, though, focuses on retirees only, as do a few other Dutch job agencies (Uitzendbureau 65plus, Actief 65+). The financial side of regaining employment is somewhat more attractive for those who have passed the statutory retirement age, as additional income does not affect state pensions, while it would more often affect early retirement arrangements. Pittig’s media partner is Telegraaf Media Group (TMG). Besides its national daily newspaper ( De Telegraaf ), TMG publishes regional dailies, free newspapers and magazines, which are relatively well read among retirees. About 40 placements have been achieved in the first few months of Pittig’s existence, on average for around 20 hours per week and a duration of six months. Vacancies involve, for example, nursing, cleaning, sales, supervising university exams, driving lease cars from point to point and teaching at primary and secondary schools. Around three-quarters are retirees with previous experience in the area. This is often the case, for example, for receptionists. One-quarter took on work in a sector new to them, such as a retired medical doctor who currently enjoys being a driver. Many of the working retirees realised after a few months in retirement that they do not want to be out of the labour force for the rest of their lives, often for social reasons. Generally, the company finds it harder to attract companies than retirees. Pittig searches to attract companies by emphasising retirees’ loyalty, their high motivation because their choice to work is often because of free will and their superior flexibility. On the other hand, Pittig attracts retirees by convincing them that work is a way to stay active and socially integrated, that society needs them, that they can work with flexible working times and that it provides some extra income. It aims to remove the doubts about the impact on their pensions and the doubt that they are not needed anymore. Pittig also provides information to both retirees and companies employing them about administrative issues, such as consequences for pension receipt from other sources. This was considered necessary because when retirees would enquire at the relevant institutions about consequences for their income if they continue working, they would often be met with an attitude of ‘why are you asking this, you should enjoy your retirement’. Creating an ‘age-friendly’ reputation (attracting media attention) can also facilitate recruiting retirees. Some companies even have a reputation of specifically employing retirees (see case study 16, the UK DIY and garden centre). Such reputations greatly facilitate the recruitment of retirees. Naturally, this is a strategy that is more likely to work for relatively large companies. 
Company initiatives 61 Facilitating by pooling In facilitating the administrative issues and addressing the knowledge gaps surrounding work beyond retirement, joint pooling of the group of retirees by companies can help. One possibility is to establish a collective labour agreement, clarifying the situation of a group of retirees and pooling risks (see case study 14 on the Dutch collective agreement for working retirees). Another option is to make use of temporary job agencies for seniors or retirees (see case studies 9, 11 and 13 on the Czech senior job agency, Swedish senior job agency and Dutch retiree job agency), providing employment options within a clear framework and with limited risks and administrative burdens for the employer. Case study 14: Dutch collective agreement for working retirees Doorwerk-CAO Collective labour agreement between an association of around 200 employers (Vereniging van Doorwerkgevers) from various sectors and a labour union (LBV), covering around 1,200 working retirees. The initiative was inspired by observed problems with the employment of retirees. Many employers would be hesitant about employing a retiree because, for example, disability insurances would expire at retirement. Large costs would have to be incurred when the retiree would fall ill for prolonged periods because of lack of insurance coverage. Furthermore, the contract is automatically dissolved and the retiree has no right to the minimum wage anymore. The collective agreement deals with working conditions and includes some arrangements such as the entitlement to a day off when a grandchild is born. After entering retirement or early retirement, employees become employed by Doorwerkgever BV, the executive organisation of the collective agreement. They are then placed with the employers who offer them contracts of three months, which can be prolonged indefinitely. The employer’s risk of covering absence from work is thus limited to three months. Interest is largest among employers in sectors that are coping with shortages on the labour market, such as technology. Facilitating by flexibility Flexible work arrangements have been identified as important in facilitating post-retirement work (Deller and Maxin, 2009; Reday-Mulvey, 2005). The need for flexibility often stems from care commitments for partners, parents or grandchildren. Such care commitments differ from care for children in that they are less predictable in terms of flexibility needed (compared to, for example, bringing and collecting children from school) and duration. Health reasons or simply the desire to combine work effectively with leisure or volunteering also play a role. When retirement is perceived as a reward for a working life, it finally allows retirees to exercise some autonomy in their use of time (Parry and Taylor, 2007). The emerging paradigm of flexible careers and the importance of maximising job fit are relevant for workers of all ages. As some people wait until retirement to adapt work to their preferences, there is a lot to learn from the experiences of retirees that can be used to shape jobs for workers of all ages. In the US context, it has been shown that poor work–life fit is significantly associated with intention to quit among those working in retirement (Brown et al, 2010). While companies need flexible work arrangements to retain and recruit retirees, employers also often prefer flexible work arrangements, especially arrangements that allow companies to adapt to fluctuations in demand. Companies also feel attracted to flexible work arrangements under specific circumstances. Several of the companies investigated see hiring retirees as an opportunity to cater for this flexibility. Flexibility has various dimensions, with sometimes different importance for employer and employee. This study sheds some light on which dimensions are of particular importance under which circumstances and for which groups of retirees. It has been noted already that flexible work, such as part-time and temporary contracts, is more common among working retirees than among other 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 62 employees. The case studies illustrate why certain arrangements might be of particular importance to attract and retain retirees. They do not necessarily correspond to the most frequent arrangements. It should be noted that if job content does not allow for flexibility, alternative options can be envisioned, for example by providing support services to look after dependants of employees if emergencies arise. In a previous Eurofound case study, there actually was a retired former employee providing such on-call services for a German chemical sector company (Eurofound, 2011b). Working hours Working full time is more difficult for many older workers for a number of reasons. Capacity, care responsibilities and having a partner who left the labour market are among them. Nevertheless, ‘difficulty’ is not the only reason why flexible part-time working arrangements are needed. Another reason purely lies in (sometimes already long-held) preferences. Many employees would like to work fewer hours than they actually do. This mismatch becomes more pronounced when employees grow older, when overall they prefer to work less than they actually do (Eurofound, 1998). Retirement can provide the opportunity to align the desired hours with the actual hours worked. If there is no clear need to continue full time, and if after a certain age retirement seems the obvious choice, then why would people continue working full time if their preference would have been part time? The idea of combining a part-time job and a partial pension is more appealing than full retirement to almost two-thirds of Europeans (European Commission, 2012b). Reducing working hours increases the likelihood that an employee would like to stay working long beyond retirement (Lachowska et al, 2008; see also case study 15, the Swedish tools company). Furthermore, as retirees fall outside of many standard contractual agreements and as standard full-time permanent contracts expire in many EU27 Member States when an employee reaches retirement age, contractually there is more scope for adjusted working hours. Case study 15: Swedish tools company The Sandvik Group Sector The development, production and distribution of tools for metal cutting, equipment and tools for the mining and construction industries and products in stainless materials Total employees 10,000 employees in Sweden, 47,000 to 48,000 globally Employees above the lower limit of statutory retirement (61) avail of the possibility to reduce their working time by 80%, 60% (only for white-collar workers) or 50% (for both white- and blue-collar workers). Income is not reduced proportionally, as the loss is compensated in the form of a partial pension for 55% to 60% (depending on collective agreement) by the company. Currently, about 300 blue- collar workers and 200 white-collar workers are benefiting from this possibility. In addition to these in-house resources, the company offers each employee who takes part in the initiative the option to meet a pension consultant to discuss its personal financial effects. It is emphasised that the initiative is a possibility rather than a right, as managerial approval is needed. Moreover, taking part in the initiative may include alternating work assignment or position, which has caused some difficulties in the process. One objective of the initiative was to improve older workers’ health, thus decreasing the need for early occupational pensions and decreasing relatively high sick leave. An external evaluation judged the measure successful on both counts. Other objectives were to open career paths for younger employees in the company, as the partial pension scheme allows for younger employees to take on some of a retiree’s responsibilities and simultaneously get tutoring from an employee with more experience, and rationalising the production processes by organising work in a way more suitable for employees. Flexible working hours does not only refer to working relatively few – but constant – weekly hours, but also to being able to occasionally increase or decrease working hours. This can be necessary to adapt to altering caring commitments or health conditions (see case study 15 on the UK DIY and garden centre below) or for the company to adjust to demand. 
Company initiatives 63 Case study 16: UK DIY and garden centre B&Q Sector DIY and garden centre, with 330 stores across the UK Employees 33,908 (3,007 retirees) Gender balance 42.9% female, 57.1% male (42.4% versus 57.6% for retirees) The company started recruiting older people especially in the 1980s when it was rapidly expanding and demand for staff was high. Experience showed that older people can benefit the business with their wealth of skills and life experience, with age diversity reflecting the customer profile. A 1989 experiment with a store entirely staffed by over-50s provided evidence for enhanced profits, less absenteeism, enhanced customer satisfaction, lower staff turnover and decreased ‘shrinkage’ (loss through waste, breakage and theft). Currently, retaining and recruiting older people is ‘business as usual’. B&Q has a strong reputation as an older age-friendly employer and as welcoming pensioners who are starting a second career. This facilitates recruitment. Most employees (95%) have a permanent contract, as have almost all (99%) working retirees. Around 60% of those working retirees were recruited beyond their retirement age, while 40% continued working at B&Q after they reached the retirement age. White-collar office staff tends to leave when they reach the retirement age, so retention is primarily associated with lower-paid, and lower-skilled, positions. Employees are entitled to work alternative hours, including term-time hours. Part-time work is particularly common among retirees: 81% work less than 30 hours per week, compared to 57% in the workforce overall. Flexibility also extends to work location. Should an employee wish to increase their hours, they can work the alternative time in an alternative store if necessary. An employee may reduce working hours during a period of ill health or for caring reasons. Once the employee wishes to work an increased number of hours again, this can be taken up in alternative stores. Project-based work/prolonged breaks Several case study companies call on retirees only when needed, and retirees who do not depend on the income in order to make ends meet seem satisfied with such arrangements (see case studies 10, 17 and 24 on the Polish ship R&D company, the German engineering company and the Austrian business consultancy). They use them as a reservoir of experienced workers for specific projects when demand is there. A clear example also comes from a documented case study in the US (Dychtwald et al, 2004), Aerospace Corporation’s Retiree Casual Program. The programme relies on a database of approximately 500 retirees, of whom around 200 are working at any one time. The 500 retirees work up to 1,000 hours per year for their old base salaries, sometimes less, depending on roles and responsibilities. Such project-based assignments allow them to have prolonged breaks, but such breaks can also be arranged in contractual form. Such breaks seem to be particularly appreciated by retirees (see case study 17, the German engineering company). About half of the nurses surveyed in a UK study indicated that working in the winter and having summers off would encourage them to delay retirement. Nevertheless, another 10% saw working summers and having winters off as an attractive scenario for altering retirement plans (Cyr, 2005). In the case studies, the possibility to take long breaks, or to be able to work occasionally on a project basis without commitments too long in advance, was also mentioned by working retirees. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 64 Case study 17: German engineering company Enterprise for mechanical engineering Sector Mechanical engineering, producing pumps and fittings Employees More than 15,600 worldwide, 2,000 at the headquarters Gender balance 18% female, 82% male The company headquarters only employs a ‘handful’ of retirees, mostly engineers with university degrees. They work as freelancers; they are only offered a temporary contract (and social insurance contributions paid) in exceptional cases, at most for a few months. The company reports that retirees working as tour guides (all are retired) and giving seminars seem to be more relaxed than others in the company, which both the retirees and the people attending seminars and tours appreciate. The works council sees no problem in having retirees working in these areas, but prefers not to see them on permanent contracts. Hiring retirees is also seen as a consequence of excessive downsizing during past harsh times. An interviewed retiree is 65 years old. When he was 60, he took early retirement, being granted the status of ‘severely disabled’. Before, he worked as an engineer in research and development, spending periods in India and Iran. Back in Germany, he took a more commercial role in a department responsible for the production and sale of pump stations. Extensive travelling and customer contacts became more and more stressful for him. The retiree currently works as a tour guide at short notice for visiting groups with interests in his fields of expertise. He also gives eight to 10 1.5-day seminars yearly, which are scheduled six months in advance, which implies knowledge transfer to not yet retired employees. The job as tour guide was offered immediately after retirement. A few weeks later, the person got knowledge about the job as instructor and applied for this job successfully. He works to earn some extra money to supplement his statutory and occupational pensions, for travelling and for similar luxuries. His children live in the US and he visits them regularly for periods of several weeks. While the retiree feels colleagues accept him well, an interviewee from HR says remarks such as ‘What’s that old fellow still doing here?’ are still heard. For the group of retirees referred to so far in this section, reliability of continued work does not seem to be a major issue, with mention of loose oral agreements and critical assessment by retirees of their willingness to continue given the circumstances (see case study 18 on the German public employment agency). Nevertheless, for those who rely on work to make ends meet (see case study 1 on the German newspaper), such project-based work can be too insecure. These low-paid retirees would probably move to another company if they are not offered a longer-term contract, regardless of small wage differences. Income security is of utmost importance to this group. Case study 18: German public employment agency Federal Employment Agency Sector Public body offering a broad range of services in the labour and training markets for citizens, companies and institutions (for example, placement of job-seekers and promotion of vocational training) Employees 94,441 Gender balance Two-thirds female, one-third male The employers’ representative interviewed claims that there are currently only isolated cases of working retirees, but an extension of this type of employment is planned. Disability pensioners or civil servants in early retirement are paid up to €400 per month, the amount which can be earned without negatively impacting these retirees’ pensions, and are exempt from social contributions. Freelance contracts are also common and are often concluded orally. ‘Regular’ pensioners (former employees) are employed either on a freelance basis or under a normal employment contract subject to social insurance contributions. There are numerous different fields of employment for pensioners. They are recruited on a temporary basis for certain tasks/projects, for example as consultants to introduce short-time allowances, as instructors in training programmes for human resources development within the organisation, providing support in building up international labour market administration bodies or working as mentors or tutors. An interviewed working retiree (male, 63 years) receives a civil service pension and works on a freelance basis as a seminar instructor. He invoices for the seminars after they have been held. There are no prior written agreements, and on the existing basis of mutual trust such agreements are not considered necessary either. His employer approached him to ask if he would hold a seminar on ‘Preparation for Retirement’ to be offered for the organisation nationwide. In addition to this seminar, he works as an instructor for the seminar ‘Taking on Executive Responsibilities as a Deputy’. He applied for this position in response to an internal vacancy. Ideally, he would like to hold five or six two-day seminars per annum. He intends to work as a seminar instructor only as long as he feels healthy enough to do so and handle the task to the satisfaction of everyone involved. He expects that the time will come when he will be too far removed from daily business practice, in spite of his work as an instructor, for him to present his topics in a credible and genuinely practical way. When he reaches the age of 65, he intends to assess the situation for the first time and decide whether or not he will continue. 
Company initiatives 65 Start and finish times and breaks Especially for employees with caring commitments, flexible start and finish times and the option of having breaks can provide a solution. While such arrangements are important for retirees and those who are not yet retired alike, once again retirees are more often in a position to leave work altogether if arrangements are not adapted to their needs. Similar to other older workers, they less frequently – but still often – need to bring children to school, but they are more likely to need somewhat more irregular breaks to take parents or partners to medical checks or provide emergency care. Work content Retirement can be a natural time to adjust work content, both for the employer and employee. From the retiree’s perspective, a feeling of ‘being fulfilled’ and ‘making room for the next generation’ can exist, opening possibilities of changing into lower-skilled jobs (see case study 13 on the Dutch retiree job agency). A study among educational institutions suggested that people will be motivated to continue working after retirement when organisational support and possibilities for a change of work role are available (Bal and Visser, 2011). It should be noted that it is not only about taking on simpler tasks, but sometimes retirement provides an opportunity for reassessing conditions under which work can be prolonged, for example changing the job design into one which requires less standing (see case study 19, the UK warranties provider below). While ideally this should happen continuously over one’s working life, this does not always happen. Case study 19: UK warranties provider Domestic and General Sector Provider of warranty and production services for domestic appliances and heating systems Employees 800 (9 retirees) Gender balance 53.9% male, 46.1% female (11.1% versus 89.9% for retirees) Domestic and General (D&G) strives to have a diverse workforce to reflect its customer base. It removed the default retirement age prior to the 2011 national legislation. The largest challenge for D&G is to attract retirees to work in the customer service team at the call centre. The company reports that one of the principal barriers is that retirees assume such work to be reserved for young people. The company invests in PR to change this view. It attracts older people using radio stations aimed at older listeners. Previously, D&G trialled an induction group for mature workers (50+) only with the intention that people at similar points in life would generate mutual support. However, feedback from these sessions indicated that participants did not wish to be singled out and wanted more diverse interactions with fellow employees. Flexible working is the main request made by retirees, with most working part-time hours. Adjustments have been made to job descriptions to accommodate health issues, for example. One female working retiree is a trainer for call centre workers. She collects her state pension and works on reduced hours of 30 hours per week over four days, during evening shifts which are relatively unpopular among people who, in contrast to her, have dependents. During the months leading up to retirement, she experienced back pain that was aggravated by standing to deliver training sessions in a classroom environment. As an experienced trainer, D&G was keen for her to carry on in the role, so they negotiated reduced hours and a change in job description to include varied tasks that did not involve as much standing. An interviewed male working retiree was recruited as a call handler within the heating team at age 60. He worked full time until 74. His motivation was to be ‘out of the house’ and to stay active. In the examined cases and from the analysis above (Chapter 3, ‘Continuity from previous employment’), it is clear that work beyond retirement often does not involve a change in job content, but rather in work intensity. In several of the cases, retirees were actually reported to be motivated to continue working to stay in touch and up to date with their specific area of expertise, for which they sometimes hold great passion (see case studies 10 and 20 on the Polish ship R&D centre and 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 66 the Austrian graphics equipment company). Companies can benefit by recognising this and catering for this need. Case study 20: Austrian graphics equipment company Kodak Gesellschaft m.b.H. Sector Equipment in printing, X-ray and photo graphics Employees 125 By default, employees retire at 60, but agreements on work after retirement may be signed on an individual basis. Overall, 10% of employees are above the male statutory pension age of 65. Most have high qualifications and are offered time flexibility and part-time contracts. They combine income from pensions with income from work. An interviewed sales manager indicated he would like to work beyond retirement on a part-time contractual basis. Nevertheless, he felt there were pressures to go into early retirement because of national policy measures and of what he perceived as ‘expected behaviour’. An HR manager reported that people are more willing to work after retirement if they can make use of experience and skills. Furthermore, sometimes social considerations play a role, offering an employee a few years of work into retirement to help secure income adequacy. Work location Another dimension of flexibility that can be important for retirees is flexibility of work location. In the case studies, retirees noted that one of the considerations they made was that work was near their homes (see case study 2, the Italian supermarket), and if travel became very intensive this was mentioned as something that might prevent them from continuing work well into retirement (see case study 21 on the Italian choir). In a US study, among those over 60 who wanted to work, but who found it difficult to find the work they wanted, 41% reported it was because they did not want to travel a long distance to work (Merrill Lynch, 2006). In one case study the availability of different outlets allowed some flexibility (see case study 16 on the UK DIY and garden centre). In particular, ICT provides much scope in this area (see de Hoyos et al, 2012, forthcoming). Case study 21: Italian choir Lirico Marchigiano Vincenzo Bellini choir Sector Lyric singing during operas and concerts Employees 54, of which 1 is a retired worker Gender balance 50% female, 50% male; the working retiree is male The retired worker is a 65-year-old lyric singer (tenor). In the past this work was his ‘second job’ in parallel to his main work as an Italian teacher in secondary schools. He started his main occupation in 1972 at the age of 25 and kept teaching in different schools in the Marche region until he retired in 2004 when he was 57. In 1978 he started to work with the choir, which he kept on doing continuously after retirement from his main job. While the income from work has no direct impact on pension receipts, the retiree does mention the tax burden on this additional income. It is usual for the company to employ retired people, even if currently only one of the choristers is employed. The retiree’s working time is the same as that of his colleagues: five hours per day on average. The main reason for working after retirement is his great passion for the job: music, singing and studying new scores. Furthermore, the work allows him to stay in contact with other people. The supplemental income has always been helpful. The work climate has worsened a bit during the crisis due to lack of work, causing dissatisfaction among colleagues. He lives with his wife and would continue work forever, but the burden of daily commuting (sometimes 120 kilometres daily by car, returning late at night) in combination with care for grandchildren might make him decide to give up working in a couple of years. 
Company initiatives 67 Facilitating by training Age barriers also seem to have a role in training. Overall, older workers receive less training than younger workers. Only 30% of employees over 50 years old received training paid for by their employer, compared with 36% of workers aged between 30 and 39 years (van Houten, 2011). This does not necessarily point to age-based discrimination by employers in providing access to training. Older people might be less eager to take up training themselves. Furthermore, their needs could well be smaller because they are more experienced (see case studies 2, 4 and 9 on the Italian supermarket, the UK public healthcare provider and the Czech senior job agency). Lastly, employers are less likely to invest in training for workers who are likely to exit the company soon after the training, and are more likely to invest if the training stimulates the employee to stay longer with the company. Nevertheless, it is expected to be retirement that matters here rather than age as such. ‘The sooner they expect to retire, the shorter the payback period to recoup an investment in upgrading their skills. If the expected retirement age rises, so should investments in training, which would allow workers to remain productive longer’ (Munnell and Sass, 2008, p. 100). If employers know that older employees might stay for several years (sometimes even more so than younger ones, who are inclined to switch companies more often), they will be more inclined to invest in training. Furthermore, people who are included in training are more likely to like their jobs and to want to go on for longer. Facilitating by tailor-made approaches Overall, retirees in the EU27 are relatively often in a position where they can accept or decline certain work options because they have a basic pension income to fall back on. Individual preferences and needs differ largely among retirees, with, for example, different retirees requiring different types of flexibility. Furthermore, from the employer point of view, available options are also individual specific. As a consequence, arrangements are often made on an individual basis (see case study 22 on the Austrian electronics company below). Case study 22: Austrian electronics company Siemens Austria Sector Electronics development and production Employees 20,000 By default employees retire at 60, but agreements on work after retirement may be signed on an individual basis. Both employee and employer needs and wishes are identified and addressed. The nature of these contracts therefore depends on the earlier contracts for the employee as well as on the demands that the employer and employee have. Motivations for working retirees include financial offers, increased public pension and part-time work. This does not mean that institutionally these processes need to be ad hoc. For example, employers may wish to institutionalise pre-retirement conversations with individual employees to explore options and potentially reach individual agreements. This is especially relevant because of the information problems mentioned above. Not only do these needs differ among individual retirees, they can also be hard to identify beyond trust-based conversations with individual employees. For example, employees can be reluctant to raise caring commitments for older parents or partners (see case study 23 on the UK cooperative). Formal policies stimulating one-to-one conversations with managers were pointed out to be a potential solution. 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 68 With regard to the timing of such conversations, from both the employer and retiree perspective, it is important to have such conversations before or soon after retirement because retirees are less likely to be eager to work after retirement if they wait too long, for example after more than two years (Helman et al., 2008). From the retiree’s point of view, employers will be less likely to hire them after a similar period of inactivity (Karpinska et al., 2011). A few months after retirement might still be fine, as retirees are confronted with the reality of not working anymore, which some might like less than they thought they would (see case study 13 on the Dutch retiree job agency), and for employers, six months of inactivity might not influence their recruitment decisions (Karpinska et al, 2011). Case study 23: UK cooperative The Co-operative Sector Owned and controlled by its members (6 million), it operates in businesses such as food retail, farms, travel agencies, pharmacies, funeral care, financial services, motor dealerships and online electronics. Employees 93,668 (5,535 retirees) Gender balance 60.3% female, 39.7% male (80.8% versus 19.2% for retirees) The elevated rate of women among working retirees can be explained by the lower retirement age for women (62) than for men (65). Of the 2,585 working retirees aged 65 and above (3% of the total workforce), 23% were recruited after the age of 65. Of those retirees who continue their employment with the Co-operative after retirement, almost all stay in their former jobs, with ‘downshifting’ being highly uncommon. None of the working retirees are in very senior roles, but it is unclear what the barriers are that prevent longer working lives among senior managers. Most are in low-paid, low-skilled positions in the food retail sector. As of 1 October 2006 the Co-operative abolished the default retirement age, five years ahead of the national abolition. It runs a two-day retirement course discussing finances, leisure time and health but also employment options. The main change after retirement is a transition to part-time hours, with 89% working part time. The HR interviewee noted that many staff recruited after retirement ‘are a bit more keen’, thus providing better customer service due to higher commitment. Sickness absence is not perceived to be notably higher, with 4.1% among working retirees against 3.3% for other employees. Individually tailored terms and conditions, caring policy and work–life balance schemes have evolved to ensure the workforce reflects demographic changes. Overall, one in eight employees is a carer. Among them are retirees. For example, one retiree was consistently late for work. From a one-to-one conversation with the line manager, it emerged that care responsibilities for the retiree’s elderly father caused the timekeeping problems. Changing his shift to start later in the day solved the situation. A recent formal carers policy was expected to contribute to people discussing eldercare more openly, as employees are often reluctant to raise such responsibilities, while tailored working arrangements can solve the situations in a mutually beneficial way. 
69 Retiree initiatives Besides governments and companies, retirees can also take initiatives, firstly, however difficult, by ignoring the pressure often put on them by social norms and by shaping opinions in society and at the workplace. Some ‘self-discrimination’ does take place (see case study 13 on the Dutch retiree job agency). It is interesting to note that Europeans aged 65 and over are much more likely to agree that older people are a burden on society than the population overall (25% versus 14%) (European Commission, 2009). For employees who are about to retire, it can be of great benefit to speak with the employer on an individual basis to get a better sense of the possibilities of continued employment rather than assume they should retire. They can further actively inform themselves of the options and regulations. Taking up training to increase their employability can also play a role. An interesting initiative in the US includes a traineeship programme where retirees can be placed at different companies typically for 6 to 12 months to develop new skills. 41 Retirees receive a stipend during this period. This funding comes from different sources, such as former employers, sponsoring companies and the government. As can be seen from the analysis above, while a high share of self-employment among retirees does not reflect entrepreneurship, many retirees have still started their own companies. Even in a hostile labour market, retirees have thus been creating their own employment options, and frequently for others as well. While there is a risk of failure (see case study 2 on the Italian supermarket), self- employment also allows them to create working conditions that suit their particular needs (see case study 5, the Swedish self-employed consultants). Retirees can also try to avoid the need to work against their will in retirement by guaranteeing enough income from other sources in retirement. While this is less of an option for those on low incomes and large financial commitments, it is an option for others who risk underestimating the savings needed for a comfortable retirement. Realistic projections can help them with this, as can transparent systems informing them of the income their pension savings guarantee so far, and effective protection of savings. Lastly, retirees can organise themselves in various ways. Retirees can negotiate collective agreements with employers in Member States where this is a way to remove barriers (see, for example, the Dutch collective agreement for working retirees case study). They can also group into easily identifiable pools of experts (see case study 24 on the Austrian business consultancy below). 4 For more information, see http://www.encore.org/fellowships. 6 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 70 Case study 24: Austrian business consultancy Austrian Senior Experts Pool (ASEP) Sector Consultancy providing advice in the development, review and implementation of business concepts. Employees 170 ‘members’ ASEP was founded in 1989. It is an association of former high-level managers who have chosen to work as consultants after retirement. Most are male (95%) and have a university degree (87%). All consultants at ASEP are 50+, with 72% above 65, the Austrian statutory retirement age for men (60 for women). Those who did not reach the statutory retirement age have availed of an early retirement package. A small number do not work beyond retirement, but took partial retirement and partly work for ASEP. Reported motivations for retirees to work include the intergenerational transfer competence, possibilities to work abroad, the opportunity to take part in interesting projects and to maintain a certain income level. Some recruitment processes have started as a result of a retiree reading about the ASEP in newspapers, for example due to attention about one of ASEP’s projects. Most are recruited through recommendation from another member. Interviews are conducted in order to clarify the association’s activities and interests, which usually results in membership. A reported principal strength of retirees includes their networks of colleagues and clients built up during prior professional experience. ASEP retains competences by offering interesting projects and assignments to people who are socially acquainted with other members, rather than by seeking competence externally. Clients are mainly small and medium-sized companies and start-ups in marketing, finance and controlling. The ASEP has experienced an increase in demand for their work, especially in areas such as temporary top management. Due to the generally negative perception of work after retirement in Austria, competition in recruiting retirees is perceived to be low. Interest to work is high among retirees. Nevertheless, an important challenge for the company is finding new members with precisely the suitable skills to fulfil the contracts made by the company when others leave. Since many activities involve projects, flexibility is offered both in terms of part-time work or part-year work. Financially, facilitators are contract schemes that allow retirees to pay minimal taxes on extra income earned and a yearly premium of 4.2% on the assessment base to the statutory pension for every extra year in work after statutory pension age. 
71 In the past few years, most EU Member States have experienced an increase in uptake of work beyond statutory or occupational retirement ages. For these working retirees, earnings from work provide on average over half of their income. This research seeks to explain the phenomenon of work after retirement and explores the types of paid employment where retired workers can be found and the characteristics of those working retirees. The report further identifies ways in which companies seek to recruit and retain retirees and has messages for governments, companies and retirees. Explaining work after retirement in the EU On the one hand, the increase in uptake of work after retirement reflects pension inadequacy, exacerbated by increasing costs and decreasing income during the recent economic crisis. Retirees affected by income inadequacy often have worked for decades in precarious jobs or in unpaid work such as raising children and doing housework. A long-term solution should enable adequate pension systems, allowing these retirees to enjoy a well-deserved retirement without having to do paid work. Enhanced employment among younger cohorts and productivity increases can contribute to keeping such systems affordable. Nevertheless, in the short run, paid work after retirement has proven necessary for some of those who have inadequate incomes and manage to find suitable jobs to allow them to make ends meet. This applies for at least one-fifth of working retirees in the EU. Most of these retirees have low incomes, but this group also contains retirees with higher incomes who work because of financial need. They work beyond retirement because they need to, for example, in order to pay their mortgages or support people close to them. On the other hand, the increase in uptake of work beyond retirement also reflects a different trend. Overall, people who have reached retirement age over the past few years are healthier than preceding generations, have a higher level of education and are often enjoying their professional life too much to let go completely. Their jobs play an important part in their life or they see work as a way to keep socially integrated, to contribute to society or to achieve self-actualisation. Such motivations play a larger role among retired than non-retired workers. Retirees who want to work often do appreciate the additional income, which allows them a higher living standard. Nevertheless, while motivations are often numerous, at least three-fifths of working retirees are mainly motivated by non-monetary aspects. This group of retirees who want to work is diverse and also contains many people with lower-skilled jobs. With part-time work options having become more available over the past few decades, possibilities have been created to continue working with decreased intensity. This allows many retirees to continue in paid work to the extent they wish, combining it with leisure, informal care and volunteering activities. If options for this group are facilitated, work after retirement can contribute to their quality of life, and to the long-term sustainability of systems that provide adequate income after retirement for all. There are also many retirees who would like to work, but for different reasons do not have the opportunity to do so. They may not have found satisfactory work options that fit their preferences and expertise or that they can combine with caring responsibilities or health conditions. They may face discrimination because of being retired or because of age. Many of the unequal opportunities that exist before retirement also exist in the labour market after retirement, with few options for those who have been inactive or unemployed for prolonged periods before retirement. Conclusions 7 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 72 Characterising work after retirement in the EU The overall increase in work after retirement in the EU is remarkable, especially during a time with decreasing employment rates overall. Regardless of normative considerations, it is interesting to get a better understanding of this phenomenon. Who are these working retirees? They tend to be male and relatively young. While most have a low level of education, the highly educated are more likely to work after retirement. Retirees who live in urban areas and those who have a mortgage are also more likely to be in employment. What kind of work are they doing? About half of them are self-employed and the vast majority work part time. While it is relatively common for them to work in the agriculture and fisheries sector and the professional, scientific and technical activities sector, it is particularly uncommon for retirees to work in public administration. Furthermore, they relatively often work in SMEs. Nevertheless, the typical working retiree is certainly not a self-employed, relatively young male doing part-time work and working in agriculture. Five sizeable groups can be identified. One large cluster includes relatively old agricultural and fishery workers, working few hours. Such post-retirement workers can be found most often in Austria, Greece, Poland, Portugal and Romania. The second cluster comprises younger part-time retirees who do elementary work or work in services and sales (mostly female), while the third is younger part-time retirees who do elementary work or work as technicians (mostly male). There is also a large group of highly educated retirees in urban areas who work part time as professional employees but are also often self-employed. This group is relatively dominant, for example, in Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. Finally, there is a large group of self-employed people who work as managers or legislators or who are in crafts or trades. They are predominantly male. This group is particularly well represented, for example, in Belgium, Greece, Italy and Spain. What can governments do? Governments can play an important role by guaranteeing pension adequacy so that retirees do not need to work in order to make ends meet. Nevertheless, considering that millions of Europeans are already working after retirement, governments need to improve the institutional settings in this regard. In doing so, it is important for governments to consider the potentially negative impact work beyond retirement might have, for example, by eroding the right to enjoy retirement and by glorifying work among people who might not be able to work. Furthermore, there are some conflicting messages that require careful consideration, as does public opinion, in particular with regard to the perception that retirees and non-retirees might compete for jobs. The legal framework for the employment of retirees is not always well defined. Sometimes social protection measures do not apply to retirees. An example includes minimum wage regulations in some Member States. It is of potential concern that many retirees also seem to be willing to accept relatively low wages and insecure work arrangements because they have income from pensions to fall back on, or because they have no other options. It is also of potential concern that many retirees are formally self-employed, but in fact earn very little, working effectively as an employee in insecure arrangements. Often the situation is simply unclear or cumbersome. For example, in several cases retirees did not continue working straight after retirement, as they wished, but took breaks of some months simply because of administrative reasons. Tax regulation can also lack transparency and be overly complex. When the institutional framework was designed, increases in employment 
Conclusions 73 rates among retirees might not have been foreseen. Now that governments are confronted with this development, legal frameworks need to accommodate it. Governments can also play a role by fighting age discrimination and stereotypes. While this benefits people of all ages, retirees face specific issues. For example, retirement age can be used as an excuse to discontinue a contract purely on the basis of age. Other mechanisms are more subtle, such as retirees who wish to engage in employment but do not do so because they do not feel wanted anymore, they are exposed to stereotypical images of retirees enjoying leisure or they assume certain types of jobs are not meant for them. Information provision can change such stereotypes. Furthermore, with work beyond retirement becoming increasingly common, several stereotypes are likely to decline. Financial incentives are another option. Systems can be designed such that not only the individual retiree and their dependents benefit from work beyond retirement, but also society as a whole. The individual can gain from increased future pension (for example, by additional accruals) or current income (for example, by being exempted from social contributions) and by doing something enjoyable. Society can gain, for example, from savings by public pension deferral, by the contribution the working retiree makes to the economy and by avoiding undeclared work. Means-tested public pensions provide a strong disincentive to work and save. Because of concern to ensure fairness to all age groups, it is questionable whether it is desirable for employers to have strong financial incentives to hire retirees in particular, for example by being exempt from employer pension contributions. Nevertheless, the desirability of disincentives could also be challenged. Examples of disincentives include the fact that in some Member States, employers can claim disability pensions for workers below 65 but not for those above that age, and can face barriers to obtaining sick leave insurance for retirees. Good labour market policies, and increased availability of jobs, are of benefit to people of all ages. Governments also have a role to play in the integration of ‘outsiders’ in the labour market. Many retirees already gave up looking for employment long before they retired. A significant share of inactive retirees would like to work, but they are not in employment for various reasons. Governments can support those retirees who are unable to find suitable jobs but would really like to work. Ideally, governments should address this problem before older workers reach the retirement age, as return to the labour market becomes more and more difficult after prolonged unemployment or inactivity. One could also think of new jobs, such as hybrid occupations, somewhere between volunteering and paid employment, to improve public services. This could respond to the specific motivations retirees have relatively often for searching employment, such as contributing to society, in addition to earning some extra income. Measures that facilitate and support self-employment can be beneficial for anybody, including retirees who want to create their own employment options. What can companies do? As the case studies selected for this research deal with organisations that employ retirees, they all see a business case for recruiting or retaining retirees. Some employers appreciated certain characteristics of older workers in general, but also highlighted characteristics that they claimed to be specific to working retirees. One such issue is related to the increasing share of retirees among many companies’ clients. To better understand the preferences of these clients and to better connect with them, employers attach importance to having a significant share of retirees among the company’s workforce. Many employers interviewed in this research further appreciate that retirees are also often 
Income from work after retirement in the EU 74 eager to work part time or on a project basis. Employers also highlighted a particularly large work motivation among retirees. People who dislike their work are less likely to look for work in retirement, as they usually have a basic pension to fall back on, and many work for non-financial reasons. Flexible work arrangements are important for older workers in general, but they seem to be even more of a determining factor for uptake of work among retirees. Most receive some pension income and can thus maintain their standard of living, while working reduced hours more in line with their preferences. The quantitative analysis above and evidence collected from the case studies provide evidence for part-time options and temporary assignments being particularly attractive overall. Besides age-related stereotypes, retirees are affected by specific social norms, such as ‘what is this person still doing here, shouldn’t they be retired?’, ‘shouldn’t they make way for the young?’, ‘shouldn’t they enjoy their leisure?’ Stereotypes matter for people of all ages and are also important for retirees, especially because social motivations play a larger role for people to work after retirement than they do before retirement. Employers can retain retirees by acknowledging the importance of the work they do and by creating a work environment where retirees are well received by colleagues. They can also attract retirees by highlighting these issues in recruitment activities. In the particular contexts of several Member States, regulation with regard to employment after retirement requires different contractual arrangements and administrative procedures. Sometimes employers also face problems in acquiring insurances for prolonged illness of employees beyond the retirement age. Furthermore, information deficits were identified as inhibiting retirees from taking up work and inhibiting employers from hiring retirees. While government measures can address these issues, companies and employee representatives have also developed responses. For example, a special collective agreement was developed for working retirees. Furthermore, several temporary job agencies have emerged that take on the administrative burden. Retirees, or employees who are about to retire, often would like to work, but only under certain conditions. More often than those before retirement, they have the choice not to work. As this research showed, much work beyond retirement is a continuation of work with a former employer based on individual agreements between the employer and the employee. An exploratory conversation preceding retirement between the employee and the employer can remove assumptions of the retiree (‘they do not need me anymore’ or ‘they would not be prepared to let me continue working if not full time’) and of the employer (‘the retiree probably wants to enjoy retirement and stop working’, ‘the retiree probably would not accept a temporary contract’). From a company perspective, retirement provides a natural opportunity to adapt contractual arrangements, also because of the increased chance the employee will look for options elsewhere. A pre-retirement conversation allows a tailor- made post-retirement work option to be developed, taking into consideration employee and employer preferences. What can retirees do? Retirees can also do something themselves if they wish to work. They can resist societal pressure to retire, try to avoid ‘self-discrimination’, get informed about options and regulations and take up training to increase employability. Employees who are approaching retirement can take the initiative to request conversations with their employers and not assume an absence of suitable options. Retirees can further join forces in expert groups or in negotiating collective labour agreements if needed. It is not only important to focus on the working conditions at retirement, as options before retirement predict those after retirement as well. For those who earn enough to save, seeking a better 
Conclusions 75 understanding of the amount of resources needed for comfortable retirement can help in avoiding the need to work. Workers who suffer forced early retirement are particularly likely to be out of work involuntarily and also have an increased need to work. They face serious obstacles to finding work if they wish to do so, especially after some time outside the labour market. When negotiating redundancy packages with employers, arrangements which enhance the chances of finding a new job might be sought rather than one-off compensations that might seem attractive at first glance. Lastly, many retirees have established their own companies, creating work options for themselves and for others as well.

Income from work after retirement in the EU The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policymaking with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research. The Foundation was established in 1975 by Council Regulation EEC No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975. 4 5 T J - 31 - 12 - 923 - E N - C It is increasingly common for workers in the EU to take up paid work after retirement. This trend adds an important dimension to the current discourse on extending working lives. Facilitating work after retirement for those who want to work can contribute to sustainable pension systems. This study investigates retirees’ motivations for seeking paid work and their opportunities for gaining employment. It examines the extent to which work after retirement is related to income adequacy among the retired population. It also explores the types of paid employment that retirees take up and identifies ways in which companies seek to recruit and retain retirees. The report concludes with recommendations for governments, employers and retirees. I n c o m e fr o m w o r k a ft e r r e t i r e m e n t i n t h e E U doi:10.2806/42416

About the study visits programme The study visits programme for education and vocational training specialists, part of the lifelong learning programme 2007-13 (LLP), is an initiative of the European Commissionʼs Directorate-General for Education and Culture. Its objective is to support policy development and cooperation at European level in lifelong learning, notably in the context of the Lisbon process and the education and training agenda 2020 (E&T2020), as well as the Bologna and Copenhagen processes and their successors. As from 1 January 2008, Cedefop (European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training) coordinates, on behalf of the European Commission, the study visits for education and vocational training specialists and policy-makers from 2008 to 2013. A study visit is a short-term visit of three to five days for a small group of specialists and decision-makers representing various groups of education and vocational training. They are stakeholders who want to examine a particular aspect of lifelong learning in another Member State. The profile of a participant corresponds mainly to one of the following categories: • company training managers; • directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers; • directors of guidance centres; • directors of validation or accreditation centres; • educational and vocational training inspectors; • head teachers, teacher trainers; • heads of departments; • human resource managers; • owners/managers of SMEs; • pedagogical or guidance advisers; • representatives of chambers of commerce/ industry/crafts; • representatives of education and training networks and associations; • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres; • representatives of employersʼ organisations; • representatives of local, regional and national authorities; • representatives of trade unions; • researchers. The groups normally consist of 10 to15 participants. Study visits are organised locally or regionally and coordinated by the National Agency. They provide a forum for discussion, exchange and learning on themes of common interest and on European and national priorities. By exchanging innovative ideas and practices, participants promote the quality and transparency of their education and training systems. HOW TO APPLY If you want to participate in a visit, please contact your National Agency to check eligibility and other procedures. They evaluate and select candidates, and also provide any further information or clarification. A list of contact persons in your country is available online at: http://studyvisits.cedefop.europa.eu CATALOGUE 2010/11 1 
2 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS Read the catalogue carefully. Having selected the visits you are interested in, you will have to submit an application online at: http://studyvisits.cedefop.europa.eu Please note that there will be two application rounds in 2010/11. For study visits taking place from September 2010 to February 2011, you can apply by 31 March 2010 and for study visits taking place from March to June 2011, you can apply by 15 October 2010 . HOW TO USE THIS CATALOGUE This catalogue comprises the study visits that will take place from September 2010 to June 2011 exploring the themes from three different perspectives: • general education (in the catalogue - the general education type); • vocational education and training (the VET type); • comprehensive lifelong learning (the mixed type). Descriptions of the visits on education, vocational education and training and lifelong learning have been submitted by the national agencies of the participating countries specifically for this catalogue. Study visits will be organised around 8 categories of themes (mentioned below), which reflect and encompass the latest policy developments in education and training in Europe: 1. Key competences for all, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship; 2. Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training; 3. Keeping teaching and training attractive and improving leadership; 4. Education and training for employability; 5. Implementing common European instruments and tools, principles and frameworks for lifelong learning; 6. Trends and challenges in lifelong learning strategies; 7. Development of learning communities, involving all actors in education and training; 8. Promoting cross border mobility in lifelong learning; In Annex (pp. 308-326), you will find descriptions for each of the categories that present the European context and latest developments on the theme, highlight aspects for approaching the theme by study visits and provide a list of reference sources. It also defines possible topics for study visits and keywords for each category of theme. This catalogue has been designed to allow you to choose the visits that suit your professional interests and schedules best.

Le profil des participants correspond essentiellement à lʼune des catégories suivantes: • responsables de la formation professionnelle en entreprise, • directeurs dʼinstitutions, de centres ou dʼétablissements prestataires dʼenseignement et de formation professionnels, • directeurs de centres dʼorientation, • directeurs de centres de validation, • inspecteurs dʼenseignement et de formation professionnels, • professeurs principaux, formateurs dʼenseignants, • chefs de départements, • responsables des ressources humaines, • propriétaires/administrateurs de PME, • conseillers pédagogiques ou dʼorientation, • représentants de chambres de commerce/dʼindustrie/dʼartisanat, • représentants de réseaux et dʼassociations dʼenseignement et de formation, • représentants de services éducatifs, dʼagences pour lʼemploi ou de centres dʼorientation, • représentants dʼorganisations dʼemployeurs, • représentants des autorités locales, régionales et nationales, • représentants des syndicats, • chercheurs, • autres. Les groupes se composent habituellement de 10 à 15 participants. Les visites dʼétude sont organisées au niveau local ou régional et coordonnées par lʼAgence nationale.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Key competences for all, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship WHY? Using IT-media is a key skill and a great challenge for the learning process. Foreign language acquisition can benefit from IT-Media in many ways, using online dictionaries, doing Internet-based research, using interactive whiteboards, teaching grammar interactively. IT-media can support both learning strategies and language skills. As a teacher training college for English and French teachers we include use of IT-media in our curriculum. We also encourage trainee teachers to use IT-media more often in a foreign language classroom. We cooperate with about 60 schools where student teachers are trained to enrich their job experience by giving theory a chance to meet practial teaching. We should like to share some of the approaches we use in our teacher training programme and exchange best-practice ideas with participants. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • structure and contents of the teacher training programme; • some of our approaches using IT-media; • innovative methods and ways of using IT-media in foreign language teaching: (a) as an essential part of the teacher training programme; (b) as applied in some nearby schools (hospitation sequences); • what producers of coursebooks and additional software provide for foreign language teachers; • best-practice ideas presented by study visits participants. HOW? Participants will: • participate in foreign language related lectures of the teacher training programme; • observe use of IT-media in foreign language classrooms (practical teaching samples). WHOM? • Head teachers, teacher trainers. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: Der Einsatz von Neuen Medien gewinnt auch im Bereich des Sprachenlernens immer mehr an Bedeutung.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Key competences for all, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship WHY? Foreign language learning is comprised of several components, including grammatical competence, communicative competence, language proficiency, as well as a change in attitude towards oneʼs own or another culture. In our country, we teach predominantly English, German and French in our different education institutions. However, there is a lack of understanding of the need to learn different foreign languages, especially English in Turkey.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Key competences for all, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship WHY? Belgium, proclaiming itself the heart of Europe, is rich in both linguistic paradox and potential! The content and language integrated learning (CLIL) Immersion option in education began in 1998 in French-speaking Belgium. Legislation in 2007 has further framed the increasing number of schools embracing the challenge of this innovative approach to learning and teaching through English, Dutch or German. Top-down and bottom-up strategies for implementation of CLIL and for building a multilayered, collaborative support system aim to help schools and teachers develop good CLIL practice. Liège has some pioneer schools and teachers to share examples of good practice of CLIL in the three target languages. Site visits from Liège will offer a broad view of the work in progress: our ʻcoconstruction siteʼ which continues to develop and adapt to meet the needs of its players and stakeholders. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • CLIL projects and good practice of teaching content through English, Dutch or German from pre-primary to secondary levels; • CLIL implementation strategies; • in-service and support development strategies. HOW?

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Key competences for all, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship WHY? Considerable efforts have been made to stimulate self-employment through entrepreneurship training since 1980s but government support activities have had their drawbacks. For example, new small firms do not create enough jobs as most are one-person businesses. Training has not focused on this problem, merely offered measures for starting a business; not for the quality of the business. Therefore, we would like to establish a consortium to screen the quality of entrepreneurship training by concentrating on European initiatives of entrepreneur qualifications. Pirkanmaa is the most rapidly growing entrepreneurial region in Finland. Opeko and AKOL are both involved with entrepreneurship education. Opeko with teachers at school/institute levels, AKOL at adult education level. Both institutions are engaged in international development programmes, the latest being Europapreneur diploma. WHAT?

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training WHY? In recent years, much of the pedagogical debate in Denmark has focused on the importance of matching teaching styles to learning styles. This is not least true when we talk about pupils with special needs. Our school focuses on the preferred learning style of our pupils. Our approach has centered on maximising interaction and learning with pupilsʼ laptop computers as an integral part of this. The majority of pupils, including pupils with special needs, become better at focusing and learning when faced with a well-developed interactive system. We are a small vocational school catering for the 16 to 19-year-olds. We recruit pupils from the local area as well as from the rest of Denmark to our boarding school, and an increasing number of our pupils are diagnosed with high autism. We are highly interested in expanding our international network and in being more actively involved in European dialogue on ways and means to improve our approaches to creating better learning processes in our classrooms. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • approaches and frameworks to cater for pupilsʼ different learning styles; • our integration of ICT into classrooms; • our work on integrating pupils with special needs; • different pedagogical initiatives in our local area. HOW?

CATÉGORIE THÉMATIQUE: Améliorer l΄accès, l΄équité, la qualité et l΄efficacité dans l΄éducation et la formation POURQUOI? LʼEspace méditerranéen de lʼadolescent (EMA) a été créé par le Pr Rufo à lʼHôpital Salvator en 2008. Lʼinnovation est la place faite à lʼéducation. La scolarisation participe à la prise en charge thérapeutique et est considérée comme soin à part entière. Une structure (collège/lycée), composée dʼenseignants et de personnels (santé/social) de lʼÉducation nationale, fonctionne au sein de lʼhôpital. Tout adolescent intégrant une unité de soins fait obligatoirement un bilan de scolarité. Suite à ce bilan, la scolarisation à lʼEMA peut prendre diverses formes. En échangeant avec les acteurs dʼautres pays européens, nous espérons développer nos outils et améliorer la prise en charge éducative de ces jeunes en situation de maladie. Une des finalités de la visite est la création dʼun centre de ressources international (Europe/Maghreb). QUOI? Le participant découvrira: • les dispositifs de scolarisation des malades dans le système éducatif français; • lʼoriginalité du projet de lʼEMA: les soins culturels, leur articulation avec les soins médicaux, les rôles respectifs des enseignants et des thérapeutes; • la manière dont la maladie est prise en compte dans le système éducatif des pays représentés dans le groupe. COMMENT? Le participant: • assistera à des exposés; • visitera des établissements; • rencontrera nos partenaires; • discutera avec les acteurs concernés et les autres participants, en groupes restreints ou en table ronde, pour analyser, critiquer et évaluer les dispositifs. POUR QUI? • Directeurs de centres d΄orientation, • inspecteurs d΄enseignement et de formation professionnels, • professeurs principaux, formateurs d΄enseignants, • chefs de départements, • conseillers pédagogiques ou d΄orientation, • chercheurs. 76 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS APPROCHES D’APPRENTISSAGE PERSONNALISÉES La scolarité: réserve d’espérance pour l’adolescent malade et sa famille Numéro de groupe: 46 Phase 1 24/1/2011-28/1/2011 Marseille, France Langue de travail: Français Nombre de places: 16 Minimum requis: 8 Type de visite: Enseignement général Organisateur(s): DELDON Patrick Education Nationale/ Espace Méditerranéen de l’Adolescent – Service du Professeur RUFO Hôpital Salvator 249, Boulevard Sainte Marguerite Marseille, 13274 Cedex Tel. +33-4 91 74 51 76 Fax +33-4 91 74 51 29 Email: patrick.deldon@ ac-aix-marseille.fr Website: http://www.ap-hm.fr/ http://www.ac-aix-marseille.fr WWW. www.maisondesolenn.fr/ – http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Rufo – www.fsef.net/ http://sites.google.com/site/lesamisrelaisserena Mots clés: (cid:129) abandons (cid:129) apprentissage personnalisé (cid:129) approches innovantes

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training WHY? Since a few decades, in France, we try to measure performance and establish standards and norms that allow regulating the system at the level of educational institutions. From this point of view, the use of the quality assurance notion – not widely used in France for secondary school but more and more important in higher education – must be considered in a comparative perspective. Which standards of evaluation of the secondary school could be considered good and be shared in Europe? Is quality assurance likely to promote better transparency and efficiency in secondary institutionsʼ governance and better harmony between different partners (pupils, teachers, parents, headmasters and inspectors)? Organisers of this study visit are DEPP (Direction de lʼÉvaluation, de la Prospective et de la Performance, set up by the Ministry of Education to take responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of the French education system as a whole) and CIEP (International Centre of Pedagogical Studies, also set up by the Ministry of Education). They have developed a high level of awareness and competence on these issues both at national and international levels. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • different methods of assessment and quality assurance used in France and Europe; • the relevance of this method and the benefits it can provide at local, regional and national levels; • good examples of practices. HOW? Participants will: • see a detailed presentation of different elements of the French system of measuring and benchmarking for the secondary school; • the methods of assessment in a comparative perspective; • meet actors and partners in this field. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • human resource managers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • researchers. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: La présente visite dʼétude part de lʼinterrogation suivante: comment délimiter une approche qualitative des systèmes dʼenseignement secondaire en France et en Europe? Sʼil existe en effet une véritable tradition française de mesure de la performance scolaire, il semble que la notion dʼassurance-qualité ou garantie de la qualité soit peu usuelle en dehors de lʼenseignement supérieur. On se penchera tout particulièrement sur les deux pans essentiels de cette notion (la qualité de lʼacte pédagogique et la qualité des processus administratifs en cours dans un établissement) afin de sʼinterroger sur les conditions et les bénéfices liés à son application.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Education and training for employability WHY? The Périgord Noir, two hours from both Bordeaux and Toulouse is known throughout the world for its wealth of chateaux and prehistory sites and attracts more tourists than any other area after Paris. None the less, it is a rural area with little industry and an economy overdependant on tourism. Confronted with a difficult job market with a large number of jobseekers and offers in short supply, it is vital to help young people choose a career path and build their confidence by providing them with tangible skills to help them become more employable. Salignac is one of only five towns in the Dordogne offering 14 to 18 year-olds an alternative education combining basic skills and work placement in local businesses (two weeks college/two weeks work placement throughout the year). The maisons familiales rurales (MFR) du Périgord Noir specialise in job orientation and training for work. Innovative programmes and close supervision and monitoring of pupils, both at college and at the workplace has led to a high success rate in exams (this year 96%) and to pupils either continuing in education, taking local apprenticeships or finding gainful employment. WHAT? Participants will learn about : • alternating basic skills and work experience; • integrating the national curriculum into the training programme; • supervision, monitoring and evaluation techniques; • integrating European mobility into the programme. HOW? Participant will: • visit colleges using this system and debate pros and cons with tutors; • observe teaching practice; • visit firms offering placements and meet employers acting as mentors; • hear about former pupils experiences. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • head teachers, teacher trainers.

SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: Leren op de werkplek als essentieel deel van competentieontwikkeling op individueel, maatschappelijk en bedrijfsniveau, vereist meer zicht en meer greep op de eigen rol van de lerende. Leren en opleiden zijn immers geen doel op zich, maar zijn belangrijk omdat ze voorzien in de groeiende behoefte aan competentieontwikkeling van werknemers. De behoefte kan die van het bedrijf zijn, of van bepaalde actoren in het bedrijf, maar het gaat nadrukkelijk en toenemend ook om de behoefte van de beroepsbeoefenaar zelf, die zijn ʻemployabilityʼ op peil wil houden, dan wel op zoek is naar leuker werk.

This methodology aims to bring development, innovation and sustainability to Portuguese companies, by improving the knowledge and skills of their human resources. This is a sensitive topic in the north of Portugal because the active population needs to acquire new skills to face recent social and economic challenges.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Implementing common European instruments and tools, principles and frameworks for lifelong learning, including lifelong guidance WHY? The Irish national framework of qualifications (NFQ) was introduced in 2003 and is based on an understanding of learning as a lifelong process. The NFQ promotes transparency of the education and training system and the flexibility and integration of qualifications, supports development of alternative learning pathways, establishes learning outcomes as the common reference point and promotes recognition of prior learning, which may be acquired through formal, non-formal and informal routes. The NFQ establishes a single, coherent system of awards for all education and training, which is easily understandable by learners, parents, teachers, employers and community workers. In 2009, Ireland completed referencing the NFQ to the European qualifications framework (EQF) further strengthening European cooperation, improving transparency and increasing mobility opportunities. This visit is hosted by Léargas, the national agency for management of the lifelong learning programme (ex Erasmus) in Ireland. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • national policies relating to VET, NFQ and EQF; • implementation and development of the NFQ; • recognition of prior learning; • quality assurance; • implications and benefits for learners, training providers and employers in relation to quality assurance and validation of formal, informal and non-formal learning; • referencing the NFQ to the EQF. HOW? Participants will: • discuss policy developments in Ireland and Europe with experts and governing bodies; • visit vocational training providers to look at practical implementation and impact; • meet and discuss with learners and training providers. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • directors of validation or accreditation centres, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • representatives of chambers of commerce/ industry/crafts, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of employersʼ organisations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • representatives of trade unions, • researchers. 130 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS NATIONAL AND SECTORAL QUALIFICATIONS FRAMEWORKS LINKED TO EQF NFQ implementation, quality assurance and EQF referencing Group No: 100 Round 1 12/10/2010-15/10/2010 Dublin, Ireland Working language: English Number of places: 15 Minimum required: 8 Type of visit: Mixed Organiser(s): D’ARCY Ivanna Léargas 189 Parnell Street Dublin, 1 Tel. +353-1 873 14 11 Fax +353-1 873 13 16 Email: studyvisits@leargas.ie Website: www.leargas.ie WWW. www.leargas.ie – www.nqai.ie – www.education.ie – www.nfq.ie Keywords: (cid:129) European qualifications framework (EQF) (cid:129) learning outcomes (cid:129) quality assurance

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Implementing common European instruments and tools, principles and frameworks for lifelong learning, including lifelong guidance WHY? With the CQAF (common quality assurance framework) model and the newly adopted European quality assurance reference framework (EQARF) recommendation, a common basis for quality assurance has been developed at European level. The European quality assurance reference framework (EQARF) is a tool to give insight into the different national systems, so building up common trust and exchange. Other tools, such as Europass, have been developed to support the framework and will help to improve the VET systems in Europe. The long-awaited recommendations of the European Parliament and Council on EQARF and ECVET, adopted on 18 June 2009 are a major step forward in the renewed Lisbon strategy and the Copenhagen process for vocational education and training. They provide solutions to several related issues – among others, the mobility of learners in Europe, quality in vocational education and training (VET) provision and management, and helping learners create their own pathways to qualification. To translate these recommendations to reality, all stakeholders need to be closely involved. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • how policy is turned into practice with particular focus on supporting systems and key actors in developing a culture of quality assurance; • good practices, instruments and success factors of the common quality assurance framework on different levels. HOW? Participants will: • present the quality assurance situation in VET in their own countries; • meet policy-makers, managers, researchers and developers, etc; • visit the Europass consortium and possibly other executive organisations, developing tools and instruments. WHOM? • Company training managers, • directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • directors of guidance centres, • directors of validation or accreditation centres, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of employersʼ organisations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • representatives of trade unions.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Trends and challenges in lifelong learning strategies WHY? Participation in society is generally considered to be generated through education. In Denmark and in Europe as a whole we are facing the challenge that too many people do not get any secondary education.There is a great need of innovative approaches to create key competences for all. In Denmark we have a long tradition of non-formal adult education that improves general knowledge and qualifications of the individual. It provides people with the necessary competences to take an active part in society. Recently, several steps have been taken to generate flexible ways through the educational system by combining non-formal adult education with formal education. By hosting this study visit, we hope to learn and get new ideas of how different education forms will help to develop autonomy, motivation for lifelong learning and social responsibility among the citizens in Europe. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • new ways to motivate and prepare young people and adults for formal education; • creative models for cooperation between non-formal and formal education; • new approaches to make people aware of – and to document – competences gained through non- formal education; • how personal development corresponds to forming society. HOW? Participants will: • visit non-formal schools that combine general and non-formal education with formal education; • participate in workshops with teachers in the non-formal educational system; • discuss with and be lectured by experts of popular education; • meet guidance counsellors working in non-formal adult education. WHOM? • Company training managers, • directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • directors of guidance centres, • directors of validation or accreditation centres, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • human resource managers, • pedagogical or guidance advisers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of employersʼ organisations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • representatives of trade unions, • researchers.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Development of learning communities, involving all actors in education and training WHY? Partnership and multiagency working within a local authority setting through childrenʼs trusts are an important part of the UK Governmentʼs policy for improving childrenʼs services. The policy aims to improve outcomes for all children by reconfiguring and integrating services around their needs. Childrenʼs trusts are an organisational form which brings together social services, health, education and other services. They are based on common principles, but local flexibility is encouraged to respond to local needs and opportunities. As the local authority in the UK with the most schools, Kent has a well-established childrenʼs trust network which serves as an example for best practice across the UK. Kent County Council is well placed to showcase examples of partnership and multiagency working to interested parties from across Europe, because the services it provides cut across the partnership model. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • national vision and local responses; • participation of children and families in childrenʼs trust arrangements; • information sharing, common assessment, colocation and schools; • multidisciplinary working in practice; • strategies for interagency cooperation; • interagency governance arrangements. HOW? Participants will: • visit schools and other institutions to gain first hand experience of Kent Childrenʼs Trust; • meet with key officers to learn about partnership working in Kent; • exchange best practice with colleagues across Europe; • visit the seat of the Children, Families and Education Directorate at Kent County Council. WHOM? • Head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • researchers.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Development of learning communities, involving all actors in education and training WHY? Due to several developments in todayʼs society, including the influence of Internet, early independence of children, instabilities in family life and integration of new inhabitants, social education is increasingly becoming part of the schoolʼs educational role. The visit will take place in two different places: in Leeuwarden in the north of the Netherlands, a green and peaceful province with its own language and culture, and in Utrecht, a very populated city located in the centre of the province of Holland. The visit will focus on the contrast in violence and conflicts at school in these two areas and will explore the challenge of how to improve results in education (with respect to intellect and social emotional fields). The ʻpeaceable schoolʼ, a program originated in New York (1995) will show how to build bridges between parents, pupils and teachers at school regarding violence, conflict resolution and peer mediation. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • peer mediation and conflict resolution; • more interactive education in which all stakeholders take responsibility for creating a safe school environment; • a ʻschool with a heartʼ with a role for the family in which children feel their voices are heard. HOW? Participants will: • visit a regional educational centre; • visit a municipal project on safety in schools in Utrecht; • visit a primary and secondary school in Leeuwarden and/or Utrecht; • visit an academy for nautical education which uses the ʻpeaceable school systemʼ as a guideline.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Promoting cross-border mobility in lifelong learning WHY? Our region is remote from the heart of Europe and mobility has the potential to make people more outward looking and lateral thinking. Statistics also show we have the lowest number of ethnic minority residents in England. The location of Cockermouth, Cumbria, has been selected because there are many examples of young people and adults mobilised over the past 12 years through ʻLeonardo da Vinciʼ, ʻYouthʼ, ʻLeader plusʼ and ʻCulture 2000-13ʼ programmes. Grampus Heritage is a private sector, not-for-profit non-governmental organisation with a long history of successful European mobility. We want to share our experiences. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • how mobility has helped our region to link to others that are remote and have the same problems and opportunities; • real examples of where ideas and methods have been reciprocally transferred; • how local colleges, universities and training organisations have worked through a north west network to make mobility part of accredited training; • how mobility links to real jobs and post-education mobility of workers. HOW? Participants will: • meet those who have undertaken mobility; • meet those from other countries undertaking mobility actions in Cumbria; • discuss ways of making mobility most effective, preparation and post-mobility development; • see how local networking makes mobility more effective; • visit a cultural landscape initiative developed through mobility and aiming to maintain a working Cumbrian landscape into the future.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Promoting cross-border mobility in lifelong learning WHY? General secondary schools use European standards and frameworks to add structure and depth to their international activities with pupils and teachers. Many Dutch secondary schools offer one or more international learning routes supported by the European platform and the Ministry of Education. Establishing a European/international school profile is an option for schools with sound experience in international cooperation. A stable network of partner schools in Europe is also possible for schools willing to adapt lesson plans, train teachers and adjust structures. Pupils can document their international achievements in (self-evaluation) portfolios or instruments such as Europass. Pupils and parents can choose these routes to prepare young European citizens better for their future study and work in the European Union and beyond. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • the European network Elos – Europe as a learning environment in schools – and CertiLingua supported by the European platform and the Ministry of Education; • how to implement international learning routes in their own school or country; • how to cooperate in relevant international innovation networks. HOW? Participants will: • experience how Dutch schools put international learning routes into practice; • exchange views with various stakeholders such as students, teachers, coordinators and expert organisations. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • directors of validation or accreditation centres, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • researchers.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Key competences for all, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship WHY? In Vienna, children at primary schools bring different cultural backgrounds into school life (German speaking children, children with another mother tongue who were born in Vienna and those whose parents come to Vienna because of their jobs). Primary education should enable children to perceive their own needs and interests with regard to those of other people, and to formulate them both in their mother tongue and in a second language. The multicultural background of the population requires integrative education in schools. In the multilingual context of schools nowadays intercultural learning will contribute to common understanding and breakdown of prejudice. The vision of the Vienna Board of Education is ʻmonolingualism is healableʼ so the focus of language learning should be stressed not only in our city but throughout Europe. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • initiatives of teaching and using English as a working language in primary schools; • approaches to integrate the European dimension into the curriculum; • methods and tools used in multilingual classes; • methods and tools used in classes with different abilities. HOW? Participants will: • visit different primary schools in the Vienna bilingual schooling project, the global education primary project and a school focusing on integration and self-directed learning; • observe teachersʼ work in the classroom; • meet teachers, head teachers and school supervisory authorities; • meet a representative of a district of Vienna. WHOM? • Educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • pedagogical or guidance advisers, • researchers. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: In Wiener Schulen gibt es viele Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund (und auch Deutsch sprechende Kinder mit einer anderen Muttersprache, die aber bereits hier geboren wurden und solche, deren Eltern wegen ihres Jobs nach Wien kamen). Die Grundschulerziehung sollte die Kinder dazu befähigen, ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse und Interessen zu erkennen, und sie in ihrer Muttersprache und in einer zweiten Sprache ausdrücken zu können. Der Migrationshintergund einer großen Zahl von Menschen in Wien verlangt nach integrativer Bildung in Schulen. Interkulturelles Lernen trägt zu gegenseitigem Verständnis, Anerkennung von Gemeinsamkeiten und dem Aufbrechen von Vorurteilen bei. Einsprachigkeit ist heilbar!

THEMENBEREICHE: Schlüsselkompetenzen für alle, einschließlich Kreativität, Innovation und Unternehmertum WARUM? Im Durchschnitt erbringen Jungen weniger gute Leseleistungen als Mädchen. Lesemotivation scheint dabei eine wichtige Rolle zu spielen. Schüler, die gerne lesen, lesen meist auch gut und häufig. Sechs Grundschulen und das Sächsische Bildungsinstitut widmeten sich deshalb in einem 3-jährigen Projekt in besonderer Weise der Entwicklung der Lesemotivation von Kindern. Einige Schulen arbeiteten phasenweise monoedukativ, andere weiterhin permanent koedukativ; teils lag der Fokus auf Unterrichtsmethoden, teils auf Inhalten. Die Lehrkräfte erhielten bedarfsgerechte Fortbildungen. Durch schriftliche Befragungen der Lehrer und Kinder sowie einzelne Interviews und Videobeobachtungen wurde das Projekt evaluiert. Das Projekt soll Interessierten vorgestellt werden und dem Erfahrungsaustausch mit Beteiligten ähnlicher Initiativen dienen. WAS? Die Teilnehmer werden Folgendes lernen: • Möglichkeiten zur Entwicklung der Lesemotivation bei Jungen und Mädchen; • Unterschiede zwischen geschlechterspezifischer und geschlechtersensibler Leseförderung; • Einblicke in Vor- und Nachteile monoedukativen und koedukativen Unterrichts; • Bedeutung von Genderkompetenz bei Lehrkräften für die Erfolge der Kinder. WIE? Die Teilnehmer werden: • an Projektschulen (Primarstufe) mit den beteiligten Lehrkräften und Schülern sprechen, dabei ggf. Unterricht beobachten; • mit der wissenschaftlichen Begleitung des Projektes sprechen und die Evaluationsergebnisse des Projektes kennenlernen; • mit Projektpartnern der Schulen sprechen und erfahren, wie die Genderkompetenz von Lehrkräften und Schülern entwickelt werden kann. WER? • Bildungs- und Berufsbildungsinspektoren, • Schulleiter, Lehreraus- und -fortbilder, • Forscher.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training WHY? Pre-primary education in Turkey involves children in the age group of three to five who have not reached the age of compulsory primary education, on an optional basis. In 2009, duration of compulsory education increased to nine years in 32 cities in the county as part of a ministry project to reach the desired rate. Nevsehir is one of these 32 cities. According to reports issued by the Ministry of Education in 2009, the schooling rate in the age group of five in Nevsehir increased from 52% to 97% in a year. Nevsehir is now in first place among all cities in Turkey in increasing schooling. One of the reasons for reaching the desired rate were training programmes both for pre-primary teachers and parents. The organiser is Nevsehir Provincial National Education Directorate. We want to add a European dimension to discussions on raising the schooling rate in 36 to 42 month-old. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • primary and pre-primary education in Turkey and in Nevşehir; • pre-primary schools and Turkish education compared to European culture; • creativity in pre-primary classes today; • new ideas on intercultural education by understanding pre-primary and primary education systems.

CATÉGORIE THÉMATIQUE: Améliorer l΄accès, l΄équité, la qualité et l΄efficacité dans l΄éducation et la formation POURQUOI? Pour construire lʼAquitaine de demain, notre région accorde de nombreux moyens à la jeunesse – source de créativité, de dynamisme et dʼinnovation – et veille à ce que les centres de formation en charge de ces jeunes puissent leur offrir un maximum dʼatouts pour leur réussite scolaire, leur épanouissement personnel et leur insertion professionnelle (égalité des chances dans leur formation, faire mieux comprendre aux jeunes les enjeux de la société, sʼouvrir aux autres…). Dans ce contexte, forts de nos 72 ans dʼexpérience, nous travaillons pour accompagner des jeunes dans leurs projets dans le but dʼune insertion professionnelle et sociale réussie.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training WHY? According to studies, a high percentage of Roma students drop out of the educational system without obtaining any qualifications and as a consequence, most will become unemployed. Worse, there are no successful second chance programmes in the country which could provide working opportunities for these people. Our programme tries to keep young Roma at school to get their first job. Due to cooperation between firms, schools and mentors, 90 % of the students complete vocational training and 75 % are employed after finishing school. The study visit would like to present this model as a successful option of social inclusion. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • the Hungarian educational and vocational training system and educational situation of Roma; • difficulties of dropped out Roma students; • a good model to integrate disadvantaged young adults into education with the help of teacher mentors; • a good model for integrating disadvantaged young adults into the labour market. HOW? The participants will: • meet Roma Education Fund (REF) and government experts and representatives of local government and NGOs; • meet Roma students benefiting from the programme; • meet teaching staff and mentors of the students; • meet parents of Roma students benefiting from the programme; • visit companies and firms involved in the project. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • owners/managers of SMEs, • representatives of chambers of commerce/ industry/crafts, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of employersʼ organisations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: A tanulmányút célja egy olyan program bemutatása, mely a hátrányos helyzetű és roma fiatalok munkaerőpiacra és oktatásba való integrációját szolgálja. A programba bevont diákok nagy része már nem tanköteles, viszont tanulmányait nem fejezte be, lemorzsolódott az iskolából. Ez a program számukra szeretne egy második esélyt biztosítani azáltal, hogy segít munkahelyhez juttatni őket. A program eredményeként a bevont fiatalok 90%-a befejezi a szakképzést és 75%-a munkahelyhez is jut az iskola befejezése után. A program sikere a mentorok munkájának, valamint a régióban működő cégek és gyárak közötti szoros együttműködésnek köszönhető.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training WHY? Special education in 1999: many students with disabilities were outside the educational system and there was a large gap between the levels of schooling achieved by persons with and without disabilities. A study conducted by an university found that 21.1% of the disabled population could not read or write or had not attended school, while this percentage in the population without disabilities was 3.6%. Lack of interdisciplinary cooperation, human resources and technical means, left regular teachers alone to their own devices. How far have we come? Inclusive education should be part of an overall strategy of education, building an inclusive school. Special education teachers should be integrated into the school staff. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • reorganisation of special education needs (SEN) support system; • allocation of human resources to school staff; • implementation of a national ICT resource to raise levels of activity and participation of pupils; • reform of the financing model for special education; • how to reconvert special schools into resource centres for inclusion. HOW? Participants will: • visit schools that have undertaken steps to become an inclusive school; • observe regular classes with SEN students; • meet with special education teachers and regular teachers who have to cope with inclusive school; • visit specialised units in schools for pupils/students with very complex SEN. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training WHY? Paragraph 1 of Baden-Württemberg Germanyʼs Education Act states that all schools are required to provide education and training for young people to prepare them for the requirements and developments of the world of work. It is necessary for schools to extend their scope of activities to tailor the quality of teaching and administration to changing circumstances. Thus promoting the autonomy of schools is one of the most important objectives of the educational system in Baden-Württemberg. These schools mainly take responsibility for pedagogic questions and subject, assume management responsibility and implement quality management. Internal and external evaluation provides information for self-development. The results of external evaluation are the basis of agreements on objectives between schools and authorities. Our organisationʼs areas of support are advising headmasters and supervisory groups in schools, coordinating in-service training and developing regional education networks. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • basics of quality development for vocational schools in Baden-Württemberg with Germany´s unique dual system; • basics of quality development for schools in Baden-Württemberg; • a regional education network; • activities of the regional school authority to improve and support the quality of school education. HOW? Participants will: • visit a primary, secondary and vocational school which have already implemented quality management; • meet experts to discuss aspects of quality at schools; • visit schools which are part of a regional education network. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • directors of validation or accreditation centres, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities. 236 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS QUALITY ASSURANCE MECHANISMS IN SCHOOLS AND TRAINING INSTITUTIONS How to implement quality management in operative autonomous schools Group No: 195 Round 2 21/3/2011-25/3/2011 Tübingen and Lake Constance, Germany Working language: English Number of places: 15 Minimum required: 8 Type of visit: Mixed Organiser(s): SCHNEIDER Liane Regierungspräsidium Tübingen Keplerstraße 2 Tübingen, 72074 Tel. +49- 7071 200 20 76 Fax +49- 7071 200 20 09 Email: liane.schneider@rpt.bwl.de Website: www.rp-tuebingen.de WWW. www.schule-bw.de/entwicklung/qualieval www.rp-tuebingen.de/ servlet/PB/menu/1266832/index.html www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/ rde/xchg/SID-69A5FFDE-478B956A/bst_engl/hs.xsl/10117.htm Keywords: (cid:129) evaluation (school or institution) (cid:129) lifelong guidance

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Improving access, equity, quality and efficiency in education and training WHY? The Education Act of 2004 brought great changes to the Czech education system. Schools have become more autonomous and gained more responsibilities. Powers of the Czech School Inspectorate (CSI) have been strengthened too. Initially it was only responsible for financial checks, but the new curriculum reforms have widened its scope to cover teaching matters as well. Now CSI acquires and analyses information on education and monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of the educational system. To fulfil this task CSI draws up strategic objectives for inspection activities and systems for evaluating the educational system. We would like to share our experience with other experts interested in evaluation in education. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • responsibilities and autonomy of school heads, teachers and school boards at different types of schools; • responsibilities of CSI as an administrative authority with nationwide powers; • how the evaluation is made (a unique information system for collection and evaluation of data from inspections by CSI will be presented); • Institute for Information on Education (IIE) which works with extensive statistical files on the Czech education system. HOW? Participants will: • visit various types of schools (pre-primary, primary, secondary and vocational) in Prague and central Bohemia region; • talk with school heads and teachers; • visit institutions and other organisations involved in education and evaluation; • meet representatives of local authorities, school boards, directors of education institutions and school inspectors; • have the opportunity to discuss, exchange experience and share ideas. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • representatives of trade unions. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: Školský zákon z roku 2004 přinesl rozsáhlé změny do českého vzdělávacího systému. Díky němu školy získaly větší autonomnost, zároveň také více odpovědnosti. Pravomoc České školní inspekce (ČŠI) byla taktéž posílena. Původně byla ČŠI zodpovědná jen za finanční kontrolu, nové vzdělávací reformy ji však učinily zodpovědnou i za vzdělávání jako takové. V současnosti ČŠI získává a analyzuje informace o vzdělávání a monitoruje a vyhodnocuje efektivnost vzdělávacího systému.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Keeping teaching and training attractive and improving leadership WHY? New approaches to learning and teaching need to be introduced, acknowledged and practised by each and every teacher. Classroom observation is a most powerful tool of change. It provides a practical approach to teacher development, evaluation and collaborative learning. The purpose of classroom observation is less and less inspection, and more and more consultancy and assistance to teachers. Different observation systems and ʻlayersʼ complement one another in a learning organisation: management (evaluation) observations, mentoring observations and peer observations. We at Tartu Vocational Education Centre have practiced different systems of classroom observation and have gained expertise that we would like to share and develop further with the help of our colleagues from other countries. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • classroom observation practices at Tartu Vocational Education Centre and other schools (Tartu University induction year of newly qualified teachers and mentoring); • different models and forms of observation; • how to dispel teachersʼ anxiety and fear of being observed; • how to elaborate on results of individual teachers and use these for development of the whole school. HOW? Participants will: • look at different classroom observation practices in Estonia and participating countries; • analyse, discuss and share using classroom observation in continuing professional development of individual teachers and of the school as a learning organisation. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • pedagogical or guidance advisers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • researchers.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Keeping teaching and training attractive and improving leadership WHY? In France as in many other European countries, policy tends to focus on performance and quality. This puts emphasis on effectiveness, efficiency and equity from an internal point of view, and economical, social and cultural effects from an external point of view. In a changing and uncertain context, educational managers can see that they need to be trained to improve school governance. They traditionally focused on management of procedures and resources; now they have to develop local strategies to improve pupilsʼ success and global educational quality. What kind of training is the most relevant to develop new skills for school leadership in the 21st century? The organisers of this study visit – CIEP (International Centre of Pedagogical Studies) and ESEN (National College for Education Management) – have developed a high level of competence on these issues at local and international levels. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • the objectives of educational managersʼ evolution in Europe; • different training systems of educational executives in Europe and find the similarities likely to promote the beginning of a common culture. HOW? Participants will: • see a detailed presentation of training for French schools directors and inspectors by showing examples provided by ESEN and decentralised authorities; • visit schools and meet heads and inspectors and share experiences and visions with their European partners. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • human resource managers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: Cette visite dʼétude se propose dʼengager une réflexion sur lʼévolution des responsabilités des cadres éducatifs et sur les nouvelles perspectives qui apparaissent dans leur formation. En France, en effet, les personnels de direction et les inspecteurs voient évoluer sensiblement leurs responsabilités et leurs missions, traditionnellement centrées sur la gestion des procédures et moyens, vers la prise en considération et le développement de nouvelles stratégies de pilotage et dʼévaluation. Quel type de transformation des métiers de direction ces changements impliquent-ils? Peut-on dégager des éléments de culture commune en Europe sur la question de la formation des cadres éducatifs? 260 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT IN SCHOOLS AND TRAINING PROVIDERS New orientations for educational managers’ training Group No: 219 Round 2 1/3/2011-4/3/2011 Paris, France Working language: English Number of places: 12 Minimum required: 7 Type of visit: General education Organiser(s): RABATE Philippe Centre International d’Études Pédagogiques 1, avenue Léon-Journault Sèvres, 92318 Tel. +33- 1 45 07 63 79 Fax +33- 1 45 07 60 54 Email: rabate@ciep.fr Website: www.ciep.fr WWW. www.esen.education.fr – www.ciep.fr Keywords: (cid:129) adult learning (cid:129) leadership and management (cid:129) teachers’ and trainers’ competences 
CATÉGORIE THÉMATIQUE: Maintenir lʼattrait des métiers dʼenseignant et de formateur et améliorer la direction des établissements POURQUOI? Le baccalauréat (bac), examen de fin dʼétudes secondaires, marque la fin dʼun premier parcours de vie. Il est, selon des lycéens, «la porte à franchir pour construire sa vie dʼadulte». Le lycée se doit de donner les mêmes chances à tous, tant sur le plan de la réussite au bac que sur celui dʼune intégration sociale réussie. Il contribue à faire acquérir des connaissances tout en accompagnant les jeunes vers une autre étape de leur existence, celle de leur maturité. Peut-on dire, de la même manière, que le bac valide un niveau dʼétudes mais aussi de maturité? Cʼest sur le rôle du lycée dans cette double validation, et sur les pratiques en usage concernant lʼexamen de fin dʼétudes secondaires, que portera la visite. QUOI? Le participant découvrira: • le fonctionnement des lycées généraux et professionnels; • comment lʼadministration organise le baccalauréat et les délibérations; • comment les élèves vivent cette période de leur vie. COMMENT? Le participant: • visitera des établissements de la région afin de constater la variété des pratiques; • rencontrera les responsables afin de sʼentretenir sur les approches particulières; • sʼentretiendra avec des élèves de terminale afin de comprendre leurs attentes; • rencontrera des associations de parents dʼélèves afin de percevoir leurs interrogations; • assistera à des conférences; • comparera les pratiques en usage dans son pays avec celles des autres participants (Maturité gymnasiale, Maturita, maturità …); • contribuera à lʼargumentation de la définition du Cadre européen de certifications (CEC). POUR QUI? • Responsables de la formation professionnelle en entreprise, • directeurs d´institutions, de centres ou d´établissements prestataires d´enseignement et de formation professionnels, • directeurs de centres d΄orientation, • directeurs de centres de validation, • inspecteurs d΄enseignement et de formation professionnels, • professeurs principaux, formateurs d΄enseignants, • chefs de départements, • responsables des ressources humaines, • conseillers pédagogiques ou d΄orientation, • représentants de chambres de commerce/d΄industrie/d΄artisanat, • représentants de réseaux et d΄associations d΄enseignement et de formation, • représentants de services éducatifs, d΄agences pour l΄emploi ou de centres d΄orientation, • représentants des syndicats, • chercheurs.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Keeping teaching and training attractive and improving leadership WHY? In Europe, reform efforts in self-governance at public schools are at different development stages. The political concepts behind the reforms are also different as well as the level of implementation. Head teachers, academia and local and regional authorities view experiences differently. An exchange of these experiences at European level can assist decision-makers to give momentum to a creative and innovative reform approach. With its diversity of schools, the former capital of Bonn is particularly suitable to host and organise such a visit. Further, numerous big international companies with a great interest in modern concepts of education are situated in Bonn. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • concepts of self-governance in North Rhine-Westphalian schools; • impact of human resources management on the quality of schools; • a ʻmanoeuvring roomʼ (Gestaltungsspielraum) in the pedagogical sphere; • impact of budgeting and finance on efficient use of funds. HOW? Participants will: • visit public and private schools; • participate in discussions with head teachers and representatives of local and regional authorities; • discuss strong and weak points of self-governance in public schools; • develop a joint concept paper to develop further self-governance in public schools. WHOM? • Head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • researchers. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: Die Reformen auf dem Gebiet der Eigenverantwortung von Schulen sind in Europa unterschiedlich entwickelt. Unterschiedlich sind dabei nicht nur die politischen Konzepte, sondern auch der Grad der Ausprägung der Reformen.

CATÉGORIE THÉMATIQUE: Maintenir lʼattrait des métiers dʼenseignant et de formateur et améliorer la direction des établissements POURQUOI? La régulation des systèmes dʼenseignement est en train de changer en Europe et lʼautonomie des établissements scolaires est une des composantes de cette évolution. La mise en œuvre de cette politique varie selon chaque système. Lʼautonomie est dʼailleurs une nécessité pour que chaque établissement sʼadapte au contexte dans lequel il se trouve et pour que chacun se mobilise autour dʼun projet dont il sera partie prenante. En Italie, la loi qui a établi lʼautonomie a été approuvée il y a dix ans: par conséquent, on dispose dʼune expérience à exploiter à travers une réflexion élargie et critique.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Education and training for employability WHY? According to the green paper on adult education ʻlearning for lifeʼ (2000) there was concern that ʻnew entrants may be joining the workforce at the low skill end, poorly prepared for sectoral or economic downturn or for progressing their own careersʼ. Economic trends are no longer favourable to those with low levels of education and low skills sets who are often excluded from the labour market and career progression. This change means that skills and competences of employees must continuously be developed and improved. In Ireland there are close links between education and training, working life and opportunities to learn at work thus improving employability for those with narrow skill sets in vulnerable areas of the economy. Vocational education and training plays a key role in the continuous upskilling, reskilling and further development of competences. This visit is hosted by Léargas, the National Agency for managing the Lifelong Learning Programme (ex Erasmus) in Ireland. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • national supports and initiatives designed to promote learning at work; • examples of initiatives targeting low-skilled employees and those with narrow skill sets to increase their employability; • partnerships working to increase lifelong learning; • school and business links in entrepreneurship; • workplace learning and apprenticeship. HOW? Participants will: • meet with national experts and policy-makers; • visit organisations and schools linked with workplace learning; • meet with trainers and learners; • visit innovative projects. WHOM? • Company training managers, • directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • human resource managers, • representatives of chambers of commerce/ industry/crafts, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of employersʼ organisations, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities, • representatives of trade unions, • researchers.

What is the impact of this lifestyle on our work, fitness, health? Besides physical and health aspects, sport teaches to be part of a team, to accept fair play, to improve knowledge, motivation, skills and readiness for effort. It promotes social interaction and networking, contributes to job creation and revitalising disadvantaged areas. We have developed a set of 14 innovative training programmes to prepare a flexible, employable workforce able to cope with rapid changes on the labour market. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • physical activities as methods to develop social competences; • the Czech physical education system; • active lifestyle, relaxation methods, facts and trends and diseases of civilization; • physical activity in HR policies.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Implementing common European instruments and tools, principles and frameworks for lifelong learning, including lifelong guidance WHY? The study visit we propose relies on two observations that can appear contradictory at first sight: pupil guidance in secondary schools in France jeopardises the future of literary studies because they appear to be neglected; however, it was recently noticed that enrolments in human and social sciences have increased, even though it is difficult to get a job after graduation. Is it only the case in France or can we notice the same situation in other European countries? Do the new methods of active school guidance established a few years ago in France tend to guide pupilsʼ choices when entering university? The organisers of this study visit – ONISEP (national information office on education, vocational training and professions) and CIEP (International Centre for Pedagogical Studies) – have developed a high level of competence on this issue at local and national levels. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • the challenges of study guidance and transition between secondary school and university in Europe from the example of social studies; • different structures of active guidance established in France and Europe; • good examples of practice. HOW? Participants will: • visit a regional multimedia platform of guidance and see the most innovative instruments in guidance (numeric passport, individual career); • visit university to discover the guidance systems used and meet people involved in guidance; • take part in workshops to exchange ideas with French partners. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • directors of guidance centres, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • pedagogical or guidance advisers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: Cette visite dʼétude se propose dʼengager une réflexion sur un problème particulier dʼorientation qui repose sur un constat paradoxal : alors que les élèves du Lycée tendent à délaisser la filière Lettres, les filières Sciences Humaines et Sociales connaissent encore récemment un afflux dʼinscriptions à lʼUniversité. Ces études ne débouchent pourtant pas toujours sur un emploi et on y observe également un phénomène dʼabandon important. La visite dʼétude partira de ce constat pour se pencher sur le passage de lʼenseignement secondaire au supérieur et présenter les nouvelles méthodes dʼorientation active mises en place en France dans une perspective comparatiste.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Trends and challenges in lifelong learning strategies WHY? In recent years the Maltese education system has undergone a dramatic and significant reform considered unique in its kind. Reorganising autonomous schools into organised colleges is one of these strategies. Educational reform in Malta is aimed at providing schools with as much flexibility and space for initiatives as possible. The system also provides for a strong quality assurance mechanism. The college system, whereby schools are networked vertically and horizontally to encourage collaboration and co leadership, also promotes peer review and supports aims to improve quality and propagate good practice. This strategy may be used as a model for other educational systems to observe and implement in the future. Due to its size, Malta is an ideal location to observe this system at first hand. The host institution is the European Union Programmes Agency (EUPA), the National Agency responsible for the Lifelong Learning Programme. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • methodology used to devise an educational reform policy; • cooperation between schools that form part of a college system; • organisational skills involved in college management; • the strengths and weaknesses of implementing such a system; • quality assurance as a key competence in national curricula. HOW? Participants will: • observe a State college and its mechanisms; • meet key persons who brought about the educational reform; • discuss such implementations with stakeholders who are dealing with this system; • devise a SWOT analysis of such a system. WHOM? • Educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities. 288 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS REFORMS IN NATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEMS Bolstering education in Malta through restructuring and empowerment Group No: 247 Round 2 9/5/2011-13/5/2011 Valletta, Malta Working language: English Number of places: 12 Minimum required: 8 Type of visit: General education Organiser(s): REINHARD Attard European Union Programmes Agency Lifelong Learning Porgramme 36 Old Mint Street Valletta, VLT 1514 Tel. +356- 25 58 61 12 Fax +356- 25 58 61 39 Email: reinhard.attard@gov.mt Website: www.eupa.org.mt WWW. www.llp.eupa.org.mt – www.education.gov.mt Keywords: (cid:129) leadership and management (cid:129) quality assurance (cid:129) innovative approaches

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Trends and challenges in lifelong learning strategies WHY? Lifelong learning is a priority for the government of Castilla-La Mancha. Based on the idea that education is the driving force in society and a way to social inclusion, the autonomous parliament passed a Law on Adult Education in 2002. The province of Toledo has grown significantly both from a socio-economic and a cultural point of view which places challenging demands on the adult population confronted with greater complexity in their lives. Lifelong learning may provide answers to many situations. The ʻDelegación Provincial de Educación y Ciencia in Toledoʼ is a provincial institution responsible for analysing reality, providing and managing all kinds of resources to meet every need of the adult population. It promotes good practice models so we believe this study visit will be a fruitful exchange of ideas to improve adult education for the knowledge society. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • the Law on Adult Education in Castilla-La Mancha; • how adult education has focused on flexible learning to improve the quantity and quality of programmes offered; • initiatives and teaching practice models implemented in our adult education centres; • participation of other public and private institutions in adult education. HOW? Participants will: • interact with officials, teachers and adult learners; • visit adult education centres which offer flexible and varied lifelong learning programmes; • observe different teaching practice models.

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Development of learning communities, involving all actors in education and training WHY? Schools need to be able to adapt continuously to a changing environment, and the changing needs of pupils, staff, parents and partners. Schools therefore need to have partnerships with the local community and organisations outside the school environment, where they can work effectively and efficiently together. This network of organisations from different sectors shape and support the life and development of youngsters. In a ʻcommunity schoolʼ the central focus is the total development of a youngster or a child. The welfare and the well-being of the child are crucial. A community school connects the different learning and living areas; connects the various competences and the different backgrounds in which the competences can be used. A school with such an external network is an added value for all partners involved. Since a couple of years several schools in Flanders work in this way. A study visit is an ideal opportunity to share their experiences. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • educational partnerships and networks; • initiatives and programmes which support the school and pupils; • examples of collaborative projects between the school and the local community. HOW? Participants will: • visit the Department of Education and Training, schools and organisations; • hear various opinions; • have discussions with civil servants, experts, heads of institutions and teachers. WHOM? • Directors of education and vocational training institutions, centres or providers, • directors of guidance centres, • educational and vocational training inspectors, • head teachers, teacher trainers, • heads of departments, • pedagogical or guidance advisers, • representatives of education and training networks and associations, • representatives of educational services, labour offices or guidance centres, • representatives of local, regional and national authorities. SHORT DESCRIPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY’S LANGUAGE: Scholen moeten zich constant kunnen aanpassen aan de veranderende maatschappij en aan de steeds wijzigende noden van de leerlingen, leerkrachten, ouders en partners. Scholen kunnen dit niet alleen, daarom moeten ze partnerschappen aangaan en efficiënt samen werken met hun omgeving en met organisaties buiten de schoolwereld. Hoe dit gebeurt in Vlaanderen, wordt tijdens dit studiebezoek toegelicht via presentaties, discussies, schoolbezoeken en bezoeken aan andere organisaties.

The purpose of KIS is to develop and improve projects. Results of the scan can be used as a basis for an action plan to professionalise establishments with regard to internationalisation. KIS remains a guidance and assessment tool. Next to KIS, the LdV certificate will recognise the operational capacity of an organisation to manage high-quality mobility projects under Leonardo da Vinci and their long-term commitment to continuous improvement of mobility. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • Dutch policy on cross-border mobility; • international learning routes; • constructing a genuine European area of education; • ʻquality in mobilityʼ (QIM); • recognition of learning periods abroad; • Ldv certificate.

CATÉGORIE THÉMATIQUE: Promouvoir la mobilité transfrontalière dans lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie POURQUOI? Lʼîle de La Réunion, en tant que région ultrapériphérique de lʼUnion européenne (10000 km de Paris) est confrontée, depuis la massification de lʼenseignement, à la nécessité de promouvoir une politique de mobilité, tant auprès des élèves scolarisés que des travailleurs candidats au départ. Toutes les formations nʼexistent pas à La Réunion où 9000 jeunes arrivent tous les ans sur le marché du travail qui peine à créer 3500 emplois annuels; cette situation nécessite une approche européenne et internationale de lʼinsertion. À La Réunion, des dispositifs spécifiques existent en faveur de cette mobilité devenue nécessaire pour une partie de la population désireuse de poursuivre une formation ou de trouver un emploi dans des conditions plus favorable (36% de chômage à La Réunion).

CATEGORY OF THEMES: Promoting cross-border mobility in lifelong learning WHY? Mobility, as part of learning, is a tool to create a genuine European area of education. Mobility improves competitiveness in Europe and deepens the sense of European identity. Successful mobility involves development of skills demanded by the productive sector and recognition of skills acquired. Training therefore requires close collaboration between the school and the world of production. Canaries government has been developing a training model. Professional training promotes distance learning through teletraining and drives European mobility and inter-island mobility for trainees. We would like to present our model, our teletraining platform, to show examples of cooperation between local companies and schools, as well as to show examples of good practice in mobility. Our model improves employability. WHAT? Participants will learn about: • organisation of vocational training in the Canaries; • platform development teletraining; • cooperation between companies and schools; • how to organise student mobility through Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus projects; • how we evaluate the capabilities and skills learned through student mobility; • assessment of skills and qualifications learned in European student mobility. HOW? Participants will: • meet officials of the plan of training in the Canaries; • meet with officials using the teletraining model; • visit a vocational training school; • visit companies where our students undertake work placements; • visit chambers of commerce; • meet experts from the Institute of qualifications; • meet students and teachers who have participated in Leonardo Da Vinci and Erasmus.

1. Key competences for all, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship 1.1. Description The recommendation of the European Parliament and the Council on key competences for lifelong learning (2006) defined a framework combining knowledge, skills and attitudes which all individuals need for personal fulfilment, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. It is a reference tool to support policy-makers, education and training providers, employers and learners. Key competences are a priority for all age groups. Young people should acquire key competences by the end of initial education and training to a level that equips them for adult life and provides a basis for further learning and working life. Adults need to develop and update their key competences throughout their lives to adapt flexibly to a rapidly changing world. Key competences are: communication in the mother tongue, communication in foreign languages, mathematical competence and basic competences in science and technology, digital competence, learning to learn, social and civic competences, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, cultural awareness and expression. The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) ( 1 ) reinforced the need for everyone to acquire key competence, placing it as one of the strategic objectives to improve creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship at all levels of education and training. The European year of creativity and innovation (2009) aims to raise awareness of the importance of creativity and innovation for personal, social and economic development. Those attending study visits on these themes will get acquainted with measures taken by participating countries to develop key competences for young people and adults and promote creative and innovative approaches in education and training, such as: (a) national, regional, local policies to increase the level of key competences and support creativity and innovation; (b) national curricular reforms or regional and local developments of school curricula; (c) specific initiatives and projects which promote development of key competences, creativity and innovation; (d) new approaches in organising learning and teaching; (e) innovative methods, learning environments, learning materials or assessment techniques. 1.2.

Description The Education and training 2010 work programme includes several measures and initiatives to achieve the three broad objectives to improve European education and training systems, agreed by the Stockholm European Council in 2001: • improving the quality and effectiveness of European education and training systems; • easing access of all to education and training systems; • opening education and training systems up to the wider world. These objectives are, in turn, an elaboration of the wider European goals established in the Lisbon strategy on sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, adopted in 2000. Despite several positive developments in education and training in Member States most benchmarks adopted by the Council for 2010 will not be achieved. Consequently, the 2008 Spring European Council urged Member States to take action to reduce substantially the number of early school leavers and young people who cannot CATALOGUE 2010/11 309 
read properly. Action was also requested to attract more adults especially low-skilled and older workers to education and training, to improve achievement levels of learners with a migrant background or from disadvantaged groups as well as further ease geographic and occupational mobility. Therefore access, equity, quality and efficiency of education and training systems needed to improve. Improving quality and efficiency of education and training remains a strategic objective for European cooperation in education and training after 2010. The Council conclusions on a strategic framework for cooperation (Council of European Union, 2009) stressed the importance of improving the governance and leadership of education and training institutions and developing effective quality assurance systems ( 2 ). The European year for combating poverty and social exclusion 2010 will aim to raise awareness of social exclusion and promote active inclusion. Among other priorities, this yearʼs activities will also focus on eradicating disadvantages in education and training, by addressing the needs of disabled people, immigrants and ethnic minorities and groups or persons in vulnerable situations as well as gender and age dimensions (European Commission, 2008) ( 3 ). Access, equity, quality and efficiency include the following: Access to education and training : access to pre-primary education is essential for a good start in life as it promotes childrenʼs sociability and lays the basis for further learning. It is especially important for children from families with low income, ethnic minorities and migrants. Member States have introduced alternative (more flexible) forms of education and training, second chance programmes, mechanisms for informing parents about absences and reduced costs by providing free course materials and transportation. Close cooperation between general education and vocational sectors and ʻsecond chanceʼ schools for adults is important. For children with special needs, access is increasingly considered as being given the possibility to attend general or special education based on what provides the best learning possibilities for the individual child. At higher education level, free education is key, as tuition fees may reduce access. Member States should develop diverse pathways through VET to further learning and employment. They should also improve public training programmes for the unemployed and disadvantaged learners. The quality and relevance of such programmes can be improved by encouraging stakeholder partnerships at regional and local levels and by promoting private sector involvement. Adult learning has a key role to play in responding to social exclusion. Member States should implement efficient adult learning systems that provide adults with key competences and increased labour market access. Education and training can contribute to overcoming socio-economic disadvantages, but it may also perpetuate it. Equity : all students should have an equal chance to succeed; success should not be dependent on circumstances outside the control of the pupil or student, such as the financial position of the family, parental education, parental occupational status, geographic location, ethnic and racial identity, gender and disability. At compulsory school level, the possibility for pupils who drop out of school to get a ʻsecond chanceʼ to learn has also received considerable attention. The role of initial vocational training in equipping these pupils with skills, knowledge and qualifications is important for their integration into society. More initiatives are still needed in most Member States to reduce the number of early school leavers and fight inequity due to socioeconomic disadvantages. 310 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 2 ) Council of the European Union (2009).

Quality : ensuring high quality standards at all education and training levels is essential. Building quality includes capacity building of teachers, school leaders, trainers and training managers, policies to build bridges with parents, modernising curricula and broadening extra-curricular activities, improving infrastructure and establishing a respectful environment. Quality assurance mechanisms are important at all levels of education including assessing studentsʼ competences, institutional self-assessments, external and internal evaluations, transparency and validating results. Involving, for example, social partners and actors from the labour market (ʻlearning communitiesʼ) in evaluations and validation of results is becoming more and more frequent. Efficiency : Key measures to improve institutional efficiency and adaptability to shifting educational and training demands and labour market needs are: decentralisation (including reforms to allow room for institutionsʼ own educational initiatives); deregulation; monitoring achievements through indicators on educational efficiency; mapping skills gaps and anticipating skills needs. Building a culture of evaluation into education and training systems to explore how resources (investments from the public and private sectors) can be used (more) efficiently is also essential. Study visits will present developments and measures on the following: (a) developing and implementing measures to improve access to education and training for disadvantaged groups; (b) designing and carrying out activities to achieve equity; (c) designing and implementing measures to increase quality of education and training provision; (d) evaluating and analysing education and training systems efficiency. 2.2.

Description Raising the quality of teaching and training across Member States was an important goal of the Education and training 2010 work programme. The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (Council of the European Union, 2009) ( 4 ) after 2010 reiterates the need for high quality teaching through adequate initial teacher education and continuous professional development and through making teaching an attractive career choice. Increasingly, teachers and trainers must develop new skills and competences, to face the challenges associated with increasing autonomy of education and training institutions and students. Use of new technologies and the necessity to pay attention to individual learning needs are other demands for teachers and trainers. In-service training for teachers is only compulsory in 11 Member States. Demands faced by teachers are also increasing because of stress, and aggressive behaviour in the classroom, as cited in the Commissionʼs working paper on ʻSchools for the 21st centuryʼ, all of which have a negative impact on job performance and satisfaction and can lead to educators leaving their profession prematurely. Many older teachers are expected to retire soon, which means that the teaching and lifelong learning profession must be made more attractive, with careful attention paid to recruiting new teachers and retaining existing ones. Member States face both a challenge – to replace the experience that is being lost – and an opportunity – to invest in the initial training of a new wave of teachers and improve the skills of existing teachers and teaching leaders. Improving the quality of school leadership, and promoting cooperation between educational leaders, is also vital for raising the quality of education as a whole. In 2007, the European Council emphasised the importance 312 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 4 ) Council of the European Union (2009). Council conclusions on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020), 9845/09, Brussels, 13.5.2009. Available from Internet: http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/09/st09/st09845.en09.pdf 
of access to high quality training in school leadership and management. It is also hoped that educational leaders will be able to work together to address common challenges faced by European educational systems. European cooperation is governed by a voluntary process known as the open method of coordination. Since 2004, common principles for teacher competences and qualifications have been agreed at European level, emphasising the importance of a highly qualified workforce, continuous professional development, teacher mobility and partnerships between teachers and other agencies, to Member State policy-makers. In 2007, the Council of Ministers reiterated the importance of improving the quality of teacher education, equipping teachers with leadership skills, and providing support to make teaching a more attractive career choice. Actors concerned by these developments include institutions responsible for teacher training and recruitment; leaders of schools and educational providers; bodies responsible for teacher registration, inspection and quality; social partners such as trade unions; as well as national and local policy-makers. Study visits will present developments and measures making teaching and training more attractive, improving leadership and raising the quality by highlighting: (a) developing programmes designed to recruit and retain highly qualified staff in all educational and training professions; (b) increasing the quality and competences of leaders of education and training providers; (c) ongoing professional development of teachers and trainers; (d) initiatives easing the mobility of teachers and trainers. 3.2.

4. Education and training for employability 4.1. Description The current economic crisis facing Europe requires immediate and efficient measures that will aid long-term economic and social development, reinforce competitiveness, support employability and strengthen social cohesion. The European Commission in its communication for the Spring Council Driving European recovery (European Commission, 2009) ( 5 ) outlined several elements that should help Member States design and implement appropriate and effective employment policies. Three key priorities were defined: maintaining employment, creating jobs and promoting mobility; upgrading skills and matching labour market needs; increasing access to employment. Low levels of educational attainment and insufficient skills exclude large numbers of young people from the labour market. Economic restructuring and changing skill needs are a risk to job security. People need the chance to upgrade and develop new knowledge, skills and competences at different stages in their lives. This is particularly important for people in precarious jobs, those who risk losing their jobs or are jobless, those who are older, the low qualified, those with migrant backgrounds or people with disabilities. Although Europe has not yet reached its employment targets and economic trends are not particularly favourable, some countries already have skills shortages. In the near future, Europe, potentially, faces a major skills problem. Increased life expectancy and declining birth rates bring fewer young people into the labour market and longer working lives. In 2020, 50 % of all jobs are expected to require medium qualifications and around 31.5 % will need high qualifications, whereas the demand for low qualifications will fall from a third in 1996 to around 18.5 %. The skills in many current jobs will change and require people to update them continuously, in other cases people will need to adapt to new jobs. Initial education and training provides the skills-base to build on. The knowledge, skills and competences people acquire can help them move successfully into employment and also adjust to new requirements, working methods and jobs that are yet unknown. Close cooperation with enterprises can make education and training more relevant to the world of work. Learning at the workplace can help encourage learners, who would otherwise leave prematurely, to continue their education and training. In a globalised and more mobile labour market, people also require linguistic and cultural skills to succeed. Lacking occupational language skills, for instance, might make it difficult for migrants to find (adequate) jobs or small and medium-sized enterprises to succeed internationally. To choose adequate education and training programmes and jobs, information on the skills enterprises are looking for and guidance that considers an individualʼs competences and needs are prerequisites. To encourage people to (re)enter learning and to save time and costs, it is also important that education and training institutions and employers value the knowledge, skill and competences people have acquired at work, in voluntary activities or their family lives. Ensuring skills development is also part and parcel of flexicurity. The idea is to ensure people stay in or easily find employment though they might need to move from one job to another or take career breaks. This requires comprehensive lifelong learning strategies that cover all levels and sectors of education and link education and training, employment, economic and social policies. Such strategies are not yet in place in all countries. Helping to ensure peopleʼs employability is at the heart of many joint initiatives between the European Commission and countries as well as the European social partners. The main policy initiatives at European level include: 314 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 5 ) European Commission (2009). Driving European recovery. Communication for the Spring Council. Volume 1. Brussels, 4.3.2009. COM(2009) 114 final. Available from Internet: http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/pdf/press_20090304_en.pdf 
Key competences for lifelong learning: the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament recommended Member States ( 6 ) to enable learners to acquire key competences that will help them adapt to changing labour market demands and contribute actively to society. Vocational education and training (VET): signed in 2002 in the wake of the Lisbon strategy and cooperation in education and training, the Copenhagen declaration formed the starting point for closer cooperation of the Commission, Member States and European social partners in VET. VET plays a key role in ensuring lifelong learning and supplying a skilled workforce relevant to the labour market. The Copenhagen process aims to make lifelong learning more easily accessible and to promote educational, occupational and geographical mobility. It triggered significant innovations with a direct or indirect effect on improving employability such as: common principles to increase transparency of qualifications, quality assurance in VET, lifelong guidance and validation of non-formal and informal learning. The Bordeaux communiqué of the European Ministers for Vocational Education and Training of 2008 introduced a new objective of strengthening the links between VET and the labour market and linked it to the new skills for new jobs initiative on anticipating and matching labour market and skills needs ( 7 ). Higher education : the Bologna process aims to create a European higher education area by 2010, in which students can choose from a wide and transparent range of high quality courses and benefit from smooth recognition procedures. The Bologna process proposed adopting a system essentially based on three cycles (bachelor-master-doctorate). The degree awarded after the first cycle shall be relevant to the European labour market as an appropriate level of qualification. The second cycle should lead to the master and/or doctorate degree as in many European countries. To meet the challenge of employability, links between VET and higher education become increasingly important in a lifelong learning setting. The possibility to access tertiary education is a major motivational factor for the learner to engage in VET. Member States have started to engage in bringing higher education and VET systems closer to one another. Adult learning: conclusions of the Council on adult learning (2008) stress it is vitally important both for employability and social inclusion that adults continue to learn and adapt to change: ongoing upskilling, reskilling and further development of competences are essential prerequisites for active participation in society. The Council conclusions on new skills for new jobs (Council of the European Union, 2009) state that the current economic crisis, global competition, technological changes towards the low carbon economy and an ageing population have made investing in skills at all levels and providing quality education for all critically important for Europeʼs short-term recovery and longer-term growth and competitiveness, as well as for equity and social cohesion. It is important to support Member States in anticipating future skills needs for workers and employers in the EU through regularly updated projections of labour market trends in local, regional, national and European labour markets and in analysing skills needs by sector ( 8 ).

Flexicurity strikes a balance between flexibility and security on the labour market and helps both employees and employers seize the opportunities globalisation offers. The common principles of flexicurity are: comprehensive lifelong learning strategies; effective active labour market policies; ease upward mobility and between unemployment or inactivity and work; continuous upgrading of skills. The European social partners have developed their own framework of actions for lifelong learning competence development and qualifications, but are also partners in the Commissionʼs and countriesʼ efforts to make VET in Europe better and more attractive. Study visits will present developments and measures on education and training for employability: (a) education and trainingʼs contribution to improving knowledge, skills and competence for the labour market; (b) analysing emerging skills needs and gaps in EU Member States labour markets and developing policies to address these; (c) designing and implementing activities such as transition from education and training to work, occupational guidance and workplace learning to increase employability. 4.2.

5. Implementing common European instruments and tools, principles and frameworks for lifelong learning, including lifelong guidance 5.1. Description To promote the mobility of European citizens as well as their qualifications and learning achievements, several common tools, principles and frameworks have been or are being developed at European level to reach the Lisbon goals ( 9 ). They all aim to strengthen European cooperation and improve transparency, recognition and quality assurance in all sectors of education and training. The European qualifications framework (EQF) is a common European reference framework which links countriesʼ qualifications to make qualifications more readable and understandable across different countries and systems in Europe. It has two principal aims: to promote citizensʼ mobility between countries and lifelong learning. More and more European countries are developing and implementing national qualifications frameworks (NQFs) which are closely – although not exclusively – related to EQF. Governments are interested in developing overarching frameworks to incorporate qualifications that represent learning outcomes from different fields, for example school, work, higher education and adult learning. These new frameworks are often linked to lifelong learning strategies and intended to open up to informal learning, or experience, that learners wish to have recognised. Common European principles for validation of non-formal and informal learning were set in 2004. They were transformed into guidelines in 2009 as a practical tool for developing and implementing methods and systems for validation in the Member States ( 10 ). The EQF also serves as a common European reference point for those international sector organisations that wish to develop their own qualifications across countries. This may also help to link the long-term skills demand of the labour market with education and training policies to adapt to change and restructuring brought about by globalisation. Most European countries are now engaged in the development of overarching national qualification frameworks (NQFs) which cover all subsystems. An NQF is a tool supporting coherence of policy development and lifelong learning aiming at improving access, progression and recognition of learning outcomes. Europass ( 11 ) is a tool to make citizensʼ knowledge, skills and qualifications clearly and easily understood, and foster mobility in Europe. It consists of five documents: curriculum vitae, language passport, Europass mobility, certificate supplement and diploma supplement. Transparency of qualifications and recognition of learning outcomes is further supported by tools that help learners transfer credits gained during learning periods in their own country or abroad. These are: the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET) ( 12 ) for vocational education and training (VET) and the European credit transfer and accumulation system (ECTS) for higher education. In 2009, the European Parliament and Council adopted a recommendation on establishing a European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET). In 2009, the European Parliament and Council adopted a recommendation on establishing a European quality assurance reference framework for vocational education and training ( 13 ) while common standards for 318 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 9 ) Education and training 2010 work programme (contribution to the Lisbon strategy).

higher education have already been developed. The recommendation includes a series of quality criteria and indicative descriptors as well as a reference set of quality indicators for VET. High quality guidance and counselling services support citizensʼ lifelong learning, career management and achievement of personal goals. Lifelong guidance contributes to achieving wider goals of full employment, high educational attainment and economic growth. In 2008, the Council of the European Union adopted a resolution on better integrating lifelong guidance into lifelong learning strategies ( 14 ) that reinforced the role of lifelong guidance in European education, training and employment policy development and implementation. Study visits will present European tools, principles and frameworks for lifelong learning such as: (a) developing and implementing qualifications frameworks with reference to the EQF; (b) promoting Europass and its use by education and training institutions, guidance and employment services and citizens; (c) designing and implementing quality assurance frameworks inspired by the European quality assurance reference framework; (d) tools for credit transfer to promote mobility of learners; (e) principles for recognising non-formal and informal learning; (f) promoting policy action on lifelong guidance for developing national/regional guidance delivery structures. 5.2.

Description The current economic crisis facing Europe emphasises the importance of education and training as a lever to Europeʼs recovery. The flexibility and security needed to achieve more and better jobs depend on ensuring that all citizens acquire key competences and update their skills throughout their lives. Lifelong learning supports creativity and innovation and enables full economic and social participation. That is why EU Member States and the European Commission have in recent years greatly strengthened their political cooperation through the Education and training 2010 work programme, aimed at achieving the Lisbon goals and promoting lifelong learning. The lifelong learning programme 2007-13 integrates previous actions in education and training at European level, including vocational education and training under the Copenhagen process, and links to the Bologna process, which is crucial for developing an European higher education area. The Education and training 2010 work programme uses the open method of coordination (OMC) as a strategic framework of cooperation between the Commission and Member States. The OMC is a way of spreading knowledge of best practice and achieving greater convergence towards the main EU goals by: • identifying and defining jointly the objectives to be reached; 320 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS 
• commonly defining benchmarks and indicators enabling Member States to know where they stand and to assess progress towards the set objectives; • ways to stimulate exchange and dissemination of good practice, such as peer learning activities. Recently, the European Commission in consultation with Member States reviewed European cooperation in education and training and set strategic priorities for cooperation up to 2020: • making lifelong learning and mobility a reality; • improving the quality and efficiency of education and training; • promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship; • improving creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship, at all levels of education and training. Cooperation should address learning in all contexts – whether formal, non-formal or informal – and at all levels: from early childhood education and schools through to higher education, vocational education and training and adult learning (Council of the European Union, 2009) ( 15 ). Exchanging information on different policy options can help advance reforms in national education and training systems and, with other common learning activities, further progress towards the common objectives and benchmarks for lifelong learning. Most countries have made progress in defining unified and overarching lifelong learning strategies. Within such frameworks, progress is evident in preprimary education, validation of non-formal and informal learning and most notably in national qualifications frameworks (NQFs) being developed by most EU Member States in response to the EQF based on learning outcomes. Despite progress in the above areas, the following challenges need to be addressed to achieve overarching lifelong learning strategies. Coherent and comprehensive lifelong learning strategies integrating education, higher education, adult learning and VET still need to be implemented. A holistic approach connecting lifelong learning and VET with other policy areas such as macroeconomics, employment, competition, enterprise, research and innovation, and social policies is crucial. One of the most important challenges for NQFs is whether they will be able to operate as instruments for integration, making it possible to create learning pathways across education and training sectors and build on learning outcomes acquired in non-formal and informal settings, including at the workplace. Adult participation in lifelong learning is still far from achieving the EU benchmark. Increased efforts are required to update their skills at various stages of their lives, broadening their access to education and training and have their learning valued, strengthening the quality of provisions and to achieve flexibility and security across the labour market. Low levels of educational attainment and insufficient skills are major factors of social exclusion and poor labour market performance. This is especially true for older workers, low-skilled and other disadvantaged groups (such as migrants) who risk losing or cannot find a job. Demographic and labour market trends will lead to increased demand for high skills and fewer opportunities for the low skilled. To face this challenge, further investment in human and social capital is needed and increased participation in lifelong learning encouraged. Study visits will present developments on: (a) reforms in education and training, policy measures for implementing integrated lifelong learning strategies; (b) policy measures to increase adult participation in lifelong learning; (c) implementation of flexible learning pathways and transition between different parts of national systems.

Description European education and training fulfils several important roles in our society. In addition to providing learners with the knowledge, skills and competences they need to exercise a job or profession, it also helps develop competences important for peopleʼs family and social lives. Opening up education and training systems to the wider world is one of the three strategic objectives of the work programme European education ministers agreed to help make Europe a knowledge-based society (Lisbon strategy). In its communication on Improving competences for the 21st century: an agenda for European cooperation on schools, the European Commission stresses the importance of ʻschool communitiesʼ which include partnerships with agencies, organisations and other actors outside the ʻclassicʼ school environment. 322 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS 
This makes education and training institutions more accountable to partners and enables representatives of the labour market, families, civic and environmental organisations and learners to work together to decide on intended learning outcomes, content and suitable forms of learning. Parentsʼ participation is also highly important, as it helps stimulate educational success and school improvements. Education and training institutions may contribute also to the prevention of, and the fight against, all forms of violence on children and young people and to attain a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion. In the updated strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training after 2010 (Council of the European Union, 2009) ( 16 ), it is important to develop partnerships between education and training providers ( 17 ) and businesses, research institutions, cultural actors and creative industries for acquiring the skills and competences required by the labour market and for fostering innovation. Study visits will present approaches and examples of good practice on: (a) incentives and initiatives developed at national and regional levels for education and training institutions to cooperate with external partners, including parents, municipalities, enterprises, social partners, NGOs, etc.; (b) national, regional and local examples of participative governance and evaluation of education and training institutions; (c) initiatives to prevent violence on children and young people. 7.2.

Description Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality is one strategic objective for European cooperation in education and training after 2010 (Council of the European Union, 2009) ( 18 ). Constructing a genuine European area of education is a priority for the European Union, both for cultural and economic reasons. The mobility of citizens, especially as part of education and training, helps promote a feeling of belonging to Europe, developing European awareness and emergence of European citizenship. More practically, it allows young people to improve their personal skills and employability, and teachers and trainers to broaden their experience and improve their skills. Finally, in an international economy, the ability to educate oneself and work in a multilingual environment is essential for the competitiveness of the European economy. The 2006 European quality charter for mobility is the quality reference document for education and training stays abroad. It complements the 2001 recommendation on mobility for students, persons engaged in training, volunteers, teachers and trainers. The charter, agreed by Member States, provides guidance on mobility arrangements for learning or other purposes, such as professional improvement, to both young people and adults. The European Commission launched in 2007 the new lifelong learning programme. It replaced previous education, vocational training and e-learning programmes, which ended in 2006 enabling the Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci and Grundtvig programmes to continue. The programme supports exchanges and connections between people, institutions and countries. For example student exchanges, in-service training courses in school or adult education and participation in specific short internships for vocational students in companies in another country apply to individuals. Exchanges between institutions include developing partnerships between schools in different countries, joint projects run by universities to develop joint curricula, short-term intensive programmes or establish thematic networks in different disciplines. Connections between countries include study visits for regional and national administrators in education, training and guidance, networks of national experts or publication of comparable statistics on education and training systems. 324 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 18 ) Council of the European Union (2009).

A high level expert forum on mobility was initiated by the European Commission and in July 2008 it recommended radically increasing mobility opportunities for young people in the mid-term. By 2020 at least 50 % of all young people should be able to engage in some form of cross-border mobility during their studies or training, in a work placement, or in voluntary activities. This offer should be irrespective of their social background and cover a wide range of learning contexts including school, university and vocational training as well as other formal and informal learning environments. The forum called for strategic action to eliminate barriers to mobility, ensure quality and exchange good practices. In July 2009, the European Commission launched public consultation on the green paper on promoting the learning mobility of young people ( 19 ). The green paper deals with issues from preparation until the follow up of a mobility period. It also addresses the main barriers and obstacles to mobility, and asks for suggestions and examples of good practice to overcome them. In addition to the above initiatives, common tools are being developed for transparency of qualifications and improve mobility across different countries and systems in Europe. These include the European qualifications framework for lifelong learning (EQF); the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET); the European credit transfer and accumulation system (ECTS) and Europass. Study visits will present developments and measures on implementing mobility in lifelong learning such as: (a) initiatives and projects on learning mobility in different learning contexts; (b) initiatives and projects which promote the widest access to mobility for individuals; (c) initiatives to make qualifications more readable and understandable across different countries and systems in Europe; (d) new approaches to simplify validation and recognition of knowledge, skills and competences acquired during mobility; (e) promoting Europass and its use by education and training institutions, employment services and citizens; (f) tools for transfer and recognition of learning outcomes to ease mobility of learners. 8.2.

1. Competencias clave para todos, incluyendo la creatividad, la innovación y el espíritu emprendedor 1.1. Descripción La Recomendación del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo sobre las competencias fundamentales para el apren- dizaje permanente (2006) establece un marco que combina los conocimientos, las capacidades y las actitu- des que todos necesitamos para la realización personal, la ciudadanía activa, la inclusión social y el empleo. Se trata de una herramienta de referencia para respaldar a los responsables de la formulación de políticas, las instituciones de educación y formación, los agentes sociales y los propios alumnos. Las competencias fundamentales constituyen una prioridad para todos los grupos de edad. Los jóvenes de- ben haber adquirido estas competencias al final de su educación y formación inicial para enfrentarse a la vida adulta, como punto de partida para el aprendizaje permanente y la vida laboral. Los adultos han de desarro- llar y actualizar estas competencias fundamentales a lo largo de la vida con el fin de adaptarse con flexibilidad a un mundo sujeto a rápidos cambios. Las competencias fundamentales son las siguientes: comunicación en la lengua materna, comunicación en lenguas extranjeras, competencias en matemáticas, ciencia y tecnología, competencia digital, la capacidad de aprender a aprender, competencias sociales y cívicas, espíritu emprendedor, y la expresión cultural. El marco estratégico europeo para la cooperación en el ámbito de la educación y la formación (ET 2020) ( 1 ) reforzó la necesidad de que todas las personas adquieran competencias clave, estableciéndola como uno de los objetivos estratégicos para incrementar la creatividad y la innovación, incluido el espíritu empresarial a to- dos los niveles de la educación y la formación. El Año Europeo de la Creatividad y la Innovación (2009) tiene como objetivo conseguir una mayor sensibi- lización sobre la importancia de la creatividad y la innovación en el desarrollo personal, social y económico. En las visitas de estudio que abordan este tema, se explorarán las medidas adoptadas por los países par- ticipantes con el fin de fomentar la adquisición de estas competencias fundamentales en jóvenes y adultos y fomentar los enfoques innovadores en el ámbito de la educación y la formación, tales como: (a) políticas nacionales, regionales y locales que tienden a incrementar el nivel de competencias fundamen- tales y apoyar la creatividad y la innovación; (b) reformas nacionales de los programas de estudios o reformas regionales y locales de los programas de estudios de los centros escolares; (c) iniciativas y proyectos específicos para promover la creación de competencias fundamentales, la creativi- dad y la innovación; (d) nuevos enfoques en la organización del aprendizaje y la enseñanza; (e) innovaciones en métodos, entornos de aprendizaje, materiales didácticos o técnicas de evaluación. 1.2. Lista de temas para las visitas de estudio • Incremento de los niveles de competencia lectora y matemática. • Enseñanza y aprendizaje de idiomas. • Aprendizaje de matemáticas y ciencias. • Uso de TIC en el aprendizaje. • Desarrollo del espíritu emprendedor. • Fomento de la educación intercultural. • Educación para la ciudadanía activa y el desarrollo sostenible. • Desarrollo de la creatividad en el aprendizaje y la enseñanza.

Mejora del acceso, la equidad, la calidad y la eficiencia en la educación y la formación 2.1. Descripción El programa de trabajo Educación y Formación 2010 engloba una serie de medidas e iniciativas dirigidas al cumplimiento de tres objetivos fundamentales para la mejora de los sistemas europeos de educación y forma- ción, establecidos por el Consejo Europeo de Estocolmo en 2001: 328 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS 
• mejorar la calidad y eficacia de los sistemas europeos de educación y formación; • facilitar el acceso a todos los sistemas de educación y formación; • y abrir los sistemas de educación y formación al mundo exterior. Estas metas completan a su vez los objetivos europeos más generales aprobados en 2000 dentro de la es- trategia de Lisboa para lograr un crecimiento económico sostenible, así como más y mejores empleos y una mayor cohesión social. A pesar de ciertos avances positivos por parte de los Estados miembros en educación y formación, la mayoría de los indicadores de referencia aprobados por el Consejo con vistas al 2010 no se cumplirán. Por ello, en la primavera de 2008, el Consejo Europeo instó a los Estados miembros a reducir drás- ticamente el número de abandonos escolares y la proporción de jóvenes que tienen dificultades de lectura. Se les invitó también a que adoptaran medidas para incrementar la proporción de adultos, especialmente los tra- bajadores poco cualificados y mayores, que participan en programas de educación y formación, mejorar los niveles de rendimiento de los alumnos de origen inmigrante o pertenecientes a grupos desfavorecidos, y faci- litar aún más la movilidad geográfica y profesional. Se han de mejorar así el acceso, la equidad, la calidad y la eficiencia de los sistemas de educación y formación. La mejora de la calidad y la eficiencia en la educación y la formación continúa siendo un objetivo estratégi- co para la cooperación europea en el ámbito de la educación y la formación después de 2010. Las Conclusio- nes del Consejo (Consejo de la Unión Europea, 2009) subrayaron la importancia de mejorar la gobernanza y la dirección de los centros de educación y formación e impulsar unos sistemas eficaces de aseguramiento de la calidad ( 2 ). El Año Europeo de Lucha contra la Pobreza y la Exclusión Social (2010) tendrá como objetivo conseguir una mayor sensibilización sobre la exclusión social y fomentar la inclusión activa. Entre otras prioridades, las acti- vidades de dicho año se centrarán en erradicar las desventajas en materia de educación y formación, abor- dando las necesidades específicas de las personas con discapacidad, inmigrantes y minoridades étnicas y gru- pos o personas en situaciones vulnerables (Comisión Europea, 2008) ( 3 ). El acceso, la equidad, la calidad y la eficiencia incluyen los aspectos siguientes: Acceso a la educación y formación : el acceso a la educación preescolar es esencial para empezar la vida con buen pie, ya que promueve la sociabilidad del niño y sienta las bases para el aprendizaje posterior. Es es- pecialmente importante para los niños procedentes de familias con un bajo nivel de ingresos, así como para los pertenecientes a minorías étnicas e inmigrantes. Los Estados miembros han introducido formas alternativas (más flexibles) de educación y formación, progra- mas que ofrecen una segunda oportunidad, mecanismos para informar a los padres del ausentismo escolar, ini- ciativas que reducen los costes mediante la entrega de materiales escolares y un servicio de transporte gratui- to. Es importante establecer una estrecha cooperación entre, por un lado, la educación general y la formación profesional y, por otro, las escuelas «de segunda oportunidad» que se dirigen a los adultos. Para los niños con necesidades especiales, el acceso ha de entenderse como la posibilidad de recibir educación general o espe- cial, dependiendo de lo que mejor responda a sus necesidades de aprendizaje. En la enseñanza superior, es fundamental la gratuidad, puesto que las tasas de matrícula pueden restringir el acceso a la misma. Los Estados miembros deben desarrollar distintos itinerarios en la FP para facilitar el aprendizaje comple- mentario y la empleabilidad de los ciudadanos. Asimismo, han de mejorar los programas públicos de forma- ción que se dirigen a los desempleados y a las personas desfavorecidas. La calidad y relevancia de este tipo CATALOGUE 2010/11 329 ( 2 ) Conclusiones del Consejo de 12 de mayo de 2009 sobre un marco estratégico para la cooperación europea en el ámbito de la educación y la formación («ET 2020»).

de programas pueden mejorarse fomentando las cooperaciones regionales y locales entre todas las institucio- nes interesadas y promoviendo la participación del sector privado. La formación de adultos desempeña una labor esencial a la hora de combatir la exclusión social. Los Esta- dos miembros han de implantar sistemas eficientes de formación de adultos que ofrezcan a éstos la adquisi- ción de competencias fundamentales y faciliten su inserción en el mercado laboral. La educación y la forma- ción pueden contribuir a superar las desventajas socioeconómicas, pero también pueden perpetuarlas. Equidad : todos los alumnos deben recibir las mismas oportunidades de éxito; independientemente de circuns- tancias externas, como la situación económica familiar, la educación y la situación laboral de los padres, el lu- gar de residencia, la pertenencia étnica y racial, el género y la discapacidad. En la enseñanza obligatoria, se tiende a ofrecer una “segunda oportunidad” a los alumnos que abandonan los estudios prematuramente. La formación profesional inicial contribuye a dotarles de capacidades, conocimientos y cualificaciones fundamen- tales para su integración en la sociedad. En la mayoría de los Estados miembros siguen necesitándose inicia- tivas encaminadas a reducir el abandono escolar y la desigualdad motivada por desventajas socioeconómicas. Calidad : es fundamental garantizar la calidad en todos los niveles de la educación y la formación. La mejora de la calidad exige desarrollar las capacidades de profesores, directores de los centros escolares, formado- res y responsables de formación, adoptar medidas que estrechen las relaciones con los padres, modernizar los programas de estudios y ampliar las actividades extracurriculares, mejorar las infraestructuras y crear un entorno respetuoso. Los mecanismos de garantía de la calidad son importantes en todos los niveles de edu- cación, e incluyen la evaluación de las competencias de los alumnos, la autoevaluación de los centros, las eva- luaciones externas e internas, la transparencia y la validación de resultados. Es cada vez más frecuente la par- ticipación, por ejemplo, de los agentes sociales y otros actores del mercado laboral (a través de «comunida- des de aprendizaje») en las evaluaciones y en la validación de los resultados de los centros educativos. Eficiencia : Entre las medidas básicas que contribuyen a mejorar la eficiencia de los centros adaptándola a los cambios que se producen en la demanda de educación y formación y a nuevas necesidades del mercado de trabajo, figuran la descentralización (mediante reformas que permitan el lanzamiento de iniciativas educativas por los propios centros), la desregulación, la evaluación del rendimiento mediante el uso de indicadores rela- tivos a la eficiencia educativa, la identificación de las carencias existentes en las cualificaciones y la anticipa- ción de las cualificaciones necesarias. Es también fundamental crear una cultura de evaluación en los siste- mas de educación y formación para valorar cómo utilizar con más eficiencia los recursos (inversiones de los sectores público y privado). Las visitas de estudio considerarán iniciativas y medidas relacionadas con los siguientes aspectos: (a) formulación y adopción de iniciativas para mejorar el acceso de grupos desfavorecidos a la educación y formación; (b) diseño y ejecución de actividades para conseguir la equidad; (c) formulación y puesta en práctica de medidas que refuercen la calidad en la educación y formación; (d) evaluación y análisis de la eficiencia de los sistemas de educación y formación. 2.2.

Convertir la docencia en una profesión atractiva y mejorar el liderazgo pedagógico 3.1. Descripción El incremento de la calidad de la enseñanza y la formación en todos los Estados miembros es un objetivo fun- damental del programa de trabajo Educación y Formación 2010.

do adecuada así como un desarrollo profesional continuo de profesores y formadores y hacer de la docencia una opción atractiva de carrera. Profesores y formadores han de adquirir nuevas capacidades y competencias para responder a los retos que plantean la creciente autonomía de los centros de educación y formación, así como los propios alumnos. Otras demandas a las que deben hacer frente están vinculadas tanto al uso de nuevas tecnologías como a necesi- dades de aprendizaje específicas. La formación continua del profesorado es obligatoria únicamente en 11 Es- tados miembros. Los profesores se ven confrontados a cada vez mayores desafíos, relacionados con el estrés y las conduc- tas agresivas en las aulas, como se reconoce en el documento de trabajo de la Comisión «La escuela para el siglo XXI», todo lo cual tiene un efecto negativo en el rendimiento y la satisfacción laboral y puede empujarles a abandonar la profesión docente. Dado que se espera la jubilación anticipada de un gran número de profesores mayores, es importante lo- grar que la profesión docente resulte más atractiva, prestando atención a la contratación de nuevos profeso- res y a la retención de los ya existentes. Los Estados miembros se enfrentan a varios retos: reemplazar la ex- periencia que se está perdiendo, invertir en la formación inicial de una nueva generación de profesores y me- jorar la cualificación de los actuales docentes y responsables educativos. La calidad del liderazgo en las escuelas y la cooperación entre los responsables educativos son fundamen- tales para mejorar la calidad de la educación. En 2007, el Consejo Europeo insistió en que debía fomentarse una formación de calidad para los directores y gestores de los centros escolares. En este contexto, los respon- sables educativos habrán de colaborar para responder a desafíos comunes que se plantean en los sistemas educativos europeos. La cooperación europea se rige por un proceso voluntario conocido como “método abierto de coordinación”. Desde 2004, se han establecido a escala europea unos principios comunes con el respaldo de los responsa- bles políticos de los Estados Miembros, relativos a las competencias y cualificaciones que ha de reunir el pro- fesorado, insistiéndose en la necesidad de contar con una plantilla muy cualificada, el desarrollo profesional continuo, la movilidad de los profesores y la colaboración entre profesores y otros interlocutores. En 2007, el Consejo de Ministros insistió en la necesidad de mejorar la formación del profesorado, dotándoles de capaci- dades de liderazgo y obrando para que la docencia resulte una alternativa profesional más atractiva. Estas ini- ciativas se dirigen a las instituciones responsables de la formación y selección del profesorado, los directores de escuelas y otras instituciones de formación, los organismos responsables de la certificación, inspección y calidad del profesorado, los agentes sociales, como los sindicatos, así como los responsables políticos nacio- nales y locales. En las visitas de estudio se valorarán las iniciativas y medidas que pretenden aumentar el atractivo de la en- señanza y la formación, mejorar el liderazgo pedagógico y elevar el nivel de calidad, haciendo hincapié en: (a) los programas diseñados para la contratación y retención de personal altamente cualificado en todas las profesiones relacionadas con la educación y la formación; (b) la mejora de la calidad y las competencias de los responsables de la educación y formación; (c) el desarrollo profesional continuo de profesores y formadores; (d) las iniciativas que sostienen la movilidad de profesores y formadores. 3.2.

Educación y formación para el empleo 4.1. Descripción La actual crisis económica a la que se enfrenta Europa requiere medidas inmediatas y eficaces que fomenten el desarrollo económico y social a largo plazo, refuercen la competitividad, mejoren la empleabilidad y forta- lezcan la cohesión social. En su comunicación para el Consejo Europeo de primavera «Gestionar la recupe- ración europea» (Comisión Europea 2009) ( 5 ), la Comisión Europea presentó una serie de elementos que de- berían poder ayudar a los Estados miembros a diseñar y aplicar políticas de empleo adecuadas y eficaces. Se definieron tres prioridades fundamentales : mantenimiento del empleo, creación de puestos de trabajo y fo- mento de la movilidad; mejora de los conocimientos y satisfacción de las necesidades del mercado laboral; me- jora del acceso al empleo. A causa de un bajo nivel de estudios y una cualificación insuficiente muchos jóvenes se ven excluidos del mercado laboral. Tanto las reestructuraciones económicas como los cambios en las cualificaciones demanda- das son un riesgo para la seguridad del empleo. Las personas han de tener la oportunidad de mejorar y ac- tualizar sus conocimientos, capacidades y competencias en diferentes etapas de su vida, muy especialmen- CATALOGUE 2010/11 333 ( 5 ) Comisión Europea .

te aquellas que cuentan con un empleo precario, corren el riesgo de perder su empleo o están en paro, los ma- yores, los trabajadores poco cualificados, las personas de origen inmigrante o los discapacitados Pese a que Europa no haya alcanzado todavía los objetivos para el empleo y las tendencias económicas no sean especialmente favorables, algunos países padecen ya una escasez de trabajadores cualificados. En un futuro cercano, Europa podría enfrentarse a un grave problema de cualificación. Como resultado de una es- peranza de vida cada vez más elevada y de tasas de natalidad cada vez más bajas, cada vez menos jóvenes se incorporan al mercado laboral, mientras la vida laboral se alarga. En 2020 se estima que el 50 % de los em- pleos requerirá un nivel medio de cualificación y en torno al 31,5 % una elevada cualificación, mientras que la demanda de trabajadores poco cualificados se reducirá de un tercio en comparación con los niveles de 1996, hasta llegar a un 18,5 %. Dado que las competencias exigidas en muchos puestos de trabajo cambiarán, los trabajadores tendrán que actualizarlas regularmente e incluso adaptarse a un cambio de empleo. La educación y formación inicial ofrecen unas capacidades básicas que han de desarrollarse más adelan- te. Los conocimientos, capacidades y competencias que vamos adquiriendo pueden ayudarnos a conseguir un empleo más fácilmente y adaptarnos a nuevos requisitos, métodos de trabajo y empleos que hoy en día se desconocen. A través de una cooperación estrecha con las empresas, la educación y la formación pueden atender me- jor a las necesidades del mundo laboral. El aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo puede contribuir a que alumnos, que de lo contrario abandonarían los estudios prematuramente, prosigan su educación y formación. En un mer- cado de trabajo globalizado y más móvil, los trabajadores necesitan además competencias lingüísticas y cul- turales para tener éxito. La carencia de competencias lingüísticas puede así dificultar que los inmigrantes en- cuentren un empleo adecuado o dificultar el éxito internacional de las pequeñas y medianas empresas. Para escoger programas de educación y formación adecuados y optar por empleos idóneos, se requiere in- formación sobre las cualificaciones que demandan las empresas y servicios de orientación que tengan en cuen- ta las competencias y necesidades individuales. Con el fin de animar a las personas a retomar su formación, ahorrando tiempo y costes, es importante también que tanto los centros de educación y formación como los empresarios valoren los conocimientos, capacidades y competencias previamente adquiridos en el trabajo, en actividades de ocio y voluntariado o en la vida familiar. El desarrollo de capacidades es un aspecto importante de la flexi-seguridad, con la que se pretende que las personas conserven o encuentren fácilmente un empleo aunque tengan que cambiar en ocasiones de traba- jo o interrumpir temporalmente su carrera profesional. Para ello, son necesarias estrategias integrales de apren- dizaje permanente que abarquen todos los niveles y sectores de la educación, vinculando la educación y la for- mación con las políticas de empleo, economía y asuntos sociales. No todos los países han puesto en prácti- ca este tipo de estrategias. Numerosas iniciativas conjuntas por parte de la Comisión Europea, los diferentes países y los agentes so- ciales, pretenden garantizar la capacidad de encontrar y mantener un empleo. Las principales iniciativas polí- ticas a escala europea se centran en los siguientes aspectos: Competencias fundamentales para el aprendizaje permanente: el Consejo de la Unión Europea y el Par- lamento Europeo han recomendado a los Estados miembros ( 6 ) que permitan a los alumnos adquirir compe- tencias fundamentales que les permitan adaptarse a los cambios en las demandas del mercado de trabajo y contribuir activamente a la sociedad. 334 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 6 ) Recomendación del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo sobre las competencias fundamentales para el aprendizaje permanente (2006/962/CE).

Formación profesional (FP): firmada en 2002 a raíz de la estrategia de Lisboa en el ámbito de la coopera- ción para la educación y formación, la declaración de Copenhague constituyó el punto de partida para una cooperación más estrecha entre la Comisión, los Estados miembros y los agentes sociales europeos en el ám- bito de la FP. La FP contribuye al aprendizaje permanente, permitiendo que los trabajadores desarrollen ca- pacidades que respondan a las necesidades del mercado laboral. El proceso de Copenhague pretende facili- tar el acceso al aprendizaje permanente y promover la movilidad educativa, profesional y geográfica. Innova- ciones importantes repercuten directa o indirectamente en la mejora de la empleabilidad, como la adopción de principios comunes relativos a la transparencia de las cualificaciones, la garantía de la calidad en la FP, la orien- tación permanente y la validación del aprendizaje no formal e informal. El Comunicado de Burdeos de los ministros europeos de Educación y Formación Profesional de 2008 incor- poró un nuevo objetivo de fortalecimiento de los vínculos entre la FP y el mercado laboral y lo vinculó a la ini- ciativa nuevas capacidades para nuevos empleos sobre la previsión de las capacidades necesarias y su ade- cuación a las exigencias del mercado laboral ( 7 ). Enseñanza superior : El proceso de Bolonia pretende construir un espacio europeo de enseñanza superior hacia 2010, de manera que los estudiantes puedan elegir entre un conjunto amplio y transparente de cursos de alta calidad y contar con unos procedimientos de reconocimiento sencillos. El proceso de Bolonia propo- ne la adopción de un sistema fundamentalmente basado en tres ciclos (licenciatura-master-doctorado). La ti- tulación obtenida después de cada ciclo ha de tener relevancia en el mercado de trabajo europeo por medio de un nivel de cualificación adecuado. El segundo ciclo debe desembocar en la obtención del grado de mas- ter y/o doctorado, como sucede ya en muchos países europeos. Para responder al reto de la empleabilidad, es importante estrechar vínculos entre la FP y la enseñanza su- perior en el marco del aprendizaje permanente. La posibilidad de acceder a la enseñanza terciaria es un fac- tor de motivación importante para que el alumno opte por la FP. Los Estados miembros se esfuerzan por es- tablecer puentes entre sus sistemas de enseñanza superior y de FP. Aprendizaje de adultos: Las Conclusiones del Consejo sobre el aprendizaje de los adultos (2008) insisten en que la inserción laboral y social requieren que los adultos sigan aprendiendo y adaptándose al cambio: en este sentido, la mejora continua, la actualización y ampliación de las capacidades y conocimientos son requisitos esenciales para participar activamente en la sociedad. Las Conclusiones del Consejo sobre nuevas capacidades para nuevos empleos (Consejo de la Unión Eu- ropea, 2009) la actual crisis económica, la competencia a nivel mundial, los cambios tecnológicos hacia una economía hipo carbónica y el envejecimiento de la población han otorgado una importancia crucial a las inver- siones en capacidades a todos los niveles y al existencia de una educación de calidad para la recuperación europea a corto plazo y el crecimiento y la competitividad a largo plazo, así como la igualdad y la cohesión so- cial. Es importante ayudar a los Estados miembros a prever las futuras necesidades de capacidades para los trabajadores y los empresarios en la UE mediante previsiones actualizadas de forma periódica sobre las ten- dencias de los mercados laborales a escala local, regional y europea y a analizar las necesidades en materia de capacidades en función de los sectores ( 8 ).

La flexi-seguridad tiene por objeto el equilibrio entre flexibilidad y seguridad en el mercado laboral, de modo que tanto los trabajadores como los empresarios aprovechen las oportunidades que ofrece la globalización. Entre sus principios básicos, figura la adopción de estrategias integrales para el aprendizaje permanente, la elaboración de políticas eficaces y activas de inserción laboral, la adopción de medidas para favorecer la mo- vilidad ascendente y las transiciones entre desempleo o inactividad y trabajo, y la actualización continua de las competencias. Los agentes sociales europeos han desarrollado su propio marco de actuación para promover la adquisición y actualización de competencias y cualificaciones a lo largo de la vida, pero también colaboran en las iniciati- vas emprendidas por la Comisión Europea y los distintos países con objeto de mejorar la FP y de que ésta re- sulte más atractiva en Europa. En las visitas de estudio se considerarán las iniciativas y medidas de educación y formación que fomentan la capacidad de encontrar y mantener un empleo (empleabilidad), en particular: (a) contribución de la educación y formación a la mejora de los conocimientos, capacidades y competencias para el mercado de trabajo; (b) análisis de nuevas necesidades y carencias de capacidades en los mercados laborales de los Estados miem- bros de la UE y formulación de políticas para atender dichas necesidades; (c) diseño y ejecución de iniciativas como la transición de la educación y formación al mundo laboral, la orien- tación profesional y el aprendizaje en el espacio laboral. 4.2.

Aplicar herramientas, principios y marcos europeos comunes para el aprendizaje per- manente, incluida la orientación permanente 5.1. Descripción Para favorecer la movilidad de los ciudadanos europeos y promover sus cualificaciones y logros educativos, se han desarrollado o se están desarrollando algunas herramientas, principios y marcos comunes a escala eu- ropea, encaminados al cumplimiento de los objetivos de Lisboa ( 9 ). Todos ellos tienen como fin reforzar la co- operación europea y mejorar la transparencia, el reconocimiento y la garantía de la calidad en todos los sec- tores de la educación y formación. El Marco Europeo de Cualificaciones (MEC) es un marco de referencia europeo común que enlaza las cua- lificaciones nacionales para que resulten más inteligibles y comprensibles en los diferentes países y sistemas. Sus dos objetivos principales son promover la movilidad transnacional de los ciudadanos y el aprendizaje per- manente. Cada vez son más los países europeos que elaboran e implantan marcos nacionales de cualifica- ciones (MNC) estrechamente relacionados – aunque no de forma exclusiva – con el MEC. Los Estados miembros están interesados en elaborar marcos generales de cualificaciones basados en los resultados del aprendizaje en distintos ámbitos, como la escuela, el mundo laboral, la enseñanza superior y la educación de adultos. Estos nuevos marcos suelen estar vinculados a estrategias de aprendizaje permanen- te y se pretende que den cabida al aprendizaje informal o la experiencia que los ciudadanos desean que les sean reconocidos. En 2004 se establecieron principios a nivel europeo para la validación del aprendizaje no formal e informal. Dichos principios fueron transformados en directrices en 2009 como herramienta práctica para el desarrollo y la implantación de métodos y sistemas de reconocimiento en los Estados miembros ( 10 ). El MEC es también un referente europeo común para las organizaciones internacionales que representan a determinados sectores económicos y deseen desarrollar sus propias cualificaciones en distintos países. Pue- de así contribuir vincular la demanda de cualificaciones a largo plazo del mercado laboral y las políticas de edu- cación y formación, para responder a los cambios y las reestructuraciones derivados de la globalización. La mayoría de los países europeos han iniciado la creación de marcos nacionales de cualificaciones (MNC) que abarcan todos los sistemas secundarios. Un MNC es una herramienta que ayuda a mantener la coherencia en la elaboración de políticas y el aprendizaje permanente destinados a mejorar el acceso, el progreso y el re- conocimiento de los resultados del aprendizaje. 338 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 9 ) Programa de trabajo detallado para el seguimiento de los objetivos concretos de los sistemas de educación y formación en Europa.

Europass ( 11 ) es una herramienta que permite que los conocimientos, capacidades y cualificaciones de los ciudadanos sean más inteligibles, fomentando así la movilidad en Europa. Consta de cinco documentos: cu- rriculum vitae, pasaporte de lenguas europeas, movilidad Europass, suplemento de certificado y suplemento de diploma. La transparencia de las cualificaciones y el reconocimiento de los resultados del aprendizaje se apoyan tam- bién en otras herramientas que permiten a los alumnos transferir los créditos obtenidos en el curso de distin- tos períodos de aprendizaje tanto en sus países de origen como en extranjero. Se trata del Sistema Europeo de Créditos para la Formación Profesional (ECVET) ( 12 ) para la formación profesional (FP) y el Sistema Eu- ropeo de Transferencia y Acumulación de Créditos (ECTS) para la enseñanza superior. En 2009, el Par- lamento Europeo y el Consejo aprobaron una Recomendación relativa a la creación de un Sistema Europeo de Créditos para la Formación Profesional (ECVET). En 2009, el Parlamento Europeo y el Consejo aprobaron una Recomendación sobre el establecimiento de un Marco de Referencia Europeo de Garantía de la Calidad en la Educación y Formación Profesionales ( 13 ), mientras que ya se han creado normas comunes para la enseñanza superior. La Recomendación incluye una serie de criterios de calidad y descriptores indicativos, así como una referencia establecida para los indicado- res de calidad de la FP. La orientación de alta calidad y los servicios de asesoría apoyan el aprendizaje permanente de los ciuda- danos, sus carreras profesionales y el logro de sus objetivos personales. La orientación permanente contribu- ye a lograr los objetivos más amplios de pleno empleo, un elevado nivel educativo y crecimiento económico. En 2008, el Consejo de la Unión Europea aprobó una resolución titulada «Incluir mejor la orientación perma- nente en las estrategias permanentes de educación y formación permanente» ( 14 ) que reforzó el papel de la orientación permanente en la educación y formación europeas y la elaboración y aplicación de las políticas de empleo. Las visitas de estudio considerarán las herramientas, principios y marcos europeos para el aprendizaje per- manente, tales como: (a) creación e implantación de marcos de cualificaciones con referencia al MEC; (b) promoción de Europass y su utilización por centros de educación y formación, servicios de orientación y empleo y los propios ciudadanos; (c) diseño e implantación de marcos de garantía de la calidad inspirados en el marco de referencia europeo de garantía de la calidad; (d) herramientas de transferencia de créditos para promover la movilidad de los alumnos; (e) principios para el reconocimiento del aprendizaje no formal e informal; (f) fomento de la acción política sobre orientación permanente para desarrollar estructuras nacionales y re- gionales para la orientación.

Tendencias y retos en las estrategias de aprendizaje permanente 6.1. Descripción La actual crisis económica a la que se enfrenta Europa subraya la importancia de la educación y la formación como factor de recuperación europea. La flexibilidad y la seguridad que son necesarias para lograr más y me- jores empleos dependen de que los ciudadanos adquieran competencias fundamentales y actualicen sus ca- pacidades a lo largo de la vida. El aprendizaje permanente favorece la creatividad y la innovación, así como una plena participación económica y social. Los Estados miembros de la UE y la Comisión Europea han re- forzado en los últimos años su cooperación política mediante el programa de trabajo Educación y Formación 2010, que tiene por objeto la realización de los objetivos de Lisboa y la promoción del aprendizaje permanen- te. El programa integra acciones de educación y formación a escala europea, tales como la formación profe- sional en el marco del proceso de Copenhague, y enlaza con el proceso de Bolonia, indispensable para el lo- gro de un espacio europeo de enseñanza superior. El programa de trabajo Educación y Formación 2010 utiliza el método abierto de coordinación (MAC) como marco estratégico para la cooperación entre la Comisión y los Estados miembros. El MAC permite intercam- biar y explorar en profundidad buenas prácticas y lograr una mayor convergencia respecto a los principales ob- jetivos de la UE mediante: • la identificación y definición conjunta de objetivos; • la definición común de referentes e indicadores que permitan a los Estados miembros valorar en qué situa- ción se encuentran y evaluar los progresos realizados respecto a los objetivos establecidos; • el intercambio y la divulgación de buenas prácticas, a través de actividades de aprendizaje mutuo. CATALOGUE 2010/11 341 
Recientemente, la Comisión Europea en consulta con los Estados miembros reexaminó la cooperación eu- ropea en materia de educación y formación, y estableció prioridades estratégicas para la cooperación hasta 2020: • hacer realidad el aprendizaje permanente y la movilidad; • mejorar la calidad y eficacia de la educación y la formación; • promover la equidad, la cohesión social y la ciudadanía activa; • incrementar la creatividad y la innovación en todos los niveles de la educación y la formación. La cooperación debería abordar el aprendizaje en todos los contextos − formal, no formal e informal − y en todos los niveles − desde la educación en la primera infancia y la escuela hasta la enseñanza superior, la edu- cación y formación profesional y el aprendizaje de adultos (Consejo de la Unión Europea, 2009) ( 15 ). El intercambio de información sobre iniciativas políticas puede impulsar reformas en los sistemas naciona- les de educación y formación y, junto a otras actividades comunes de aprendizaje, progresar en el cumplimien- to de los objetivos comunes y los criterios de referencia establecidos para el aprendizaje permanente. La mayoría de los países han hecho avances en lo referente al diseño de estrategias para el aprendizaje permanente concertadas y globales. Así, se han conseguido logros importantes en los ámbitos de la educa- ción preescolar, la validación del aprendizaje no formal e informal y, sobre todo, el desarrollo de marcos na- cionales de cualificaciones (MNC) que la mayoría de los Estados miembros de la UE están poniendo en prác- tica, en respuesta al MEC, tomando como referencia los resultados del aprendizaje. A pesar de todos estos avances, la ejecución de estrategias generales para el aprendizaje permanente plan- tea todavía retos importantes. En este ámbito, todavía queda por implantar estrategias coherentes y globales, que integren la educación, la enseñanza superior, la educación de adultos y la FP. Es fundamental adoptar un enfoque global que vincu- le el aprendizaje permanente y la FP con otros ámbitos políticos, como la macroeconomía, las políticas de em- pleo, la competitividad económica, la empresa, la investigación e innovación y las políticas sociales. Uno de los desafíos más importantes para los MNC reside en su capacidad para funcionar como instrumen- tos de integración, haciendo posibles itinerarios de aprendizaje en los sectores de la educación y formación, e incorporando los resultados del aprendizaje adquirido en entornos no formales e informales, incluido el ám- bito laboral. La participación de los adultos en iniciativas de aprendizaje permanente no ha alcanzado aún los índices establecidos para la UE. Se precisan mayores esfuerzos con el fin de que los adultos puedan actualizar sus capacidades en las distintas etapas de la vida, se facilite el acceso a la educación y formación valorando el aprendizaje no formal e informal, se refuerce la calidad de la enseñanza impartida y se aúne la flexibilidad y la seguridad en el mercado de trabajo. A causa de un bajo nivel de estudios y una cualificación insuficiente muchos jóvenes se ven excluidos del mercado laboral, especialmente en el caso de los trabajadores mayores, aquellos con baja cualificación y quie- nes pertenecen a grupos desfavorecidos (como los inmigrantes), que pueden correr mayor riesgo de perder su empleo o de permanecer en paro. La evolución de la demografía y del mercado laboral apunta a incremen- to de la demanda de trabajadores muy cualificados y una reducción de las oportunidades para los trabajado- res con baja cualificación. Para afrontar este reto, es preciso invertir más en capital humano y social, promo- viendo una mayor participación en actividades de aprendizaje permanente. En las visitas de estudio se considerarán los siguientes aspectos: (a) reformas en materia de educación y formación, medidas políticas para la aplicación de estrategias integra- les de aprendizaje permanente; 342 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 15 ) Conclusiones del Consejo de 12 de mayo de 2009 sobre un marco estratégico para la cooperación europea en el ámbito de la educación y la formación («ET 2020»).

7. Creación de comunidades de aprendizaje con la participación todos los agentes de la educación y la formación 7.1. Descripción La educación y la formación desempeñan una función sustancial en la sociedad europea, al ofrecer a los alum- nos los conocimientos, capacidades y competencias fundamentales para la vida laboral y darles la oportuni- dad de adquirir competencias indispensables para la vida familiar y social. Entre los tres objetivos estratégicos del programa de trabajo acordado por los Ministros de Educación eu- ropeos con el fin de que Europa se convierta en una sociedad del conocimiento (Estrategia de Lisboa), figura el de Abrir los sistemas de educación y formación al mundo . En su comunicación Mejorar las competencias en el siglo XXI: agenda para la cooperación europea en las escuelas , la Comisión Europea insiste en la im- portancia de las «comunidades escolares», que conllevan colaboraciones estrechas con instituciones y acto- res externos al entorno escolar «clásico». Los centros de educación y formación adquieren así una mayor responsabilidad ante estos actores, hasta el punto de que los representantes del mercado laboral, las familias, las organizaciones cívicas y medioam- bientales, así como los propios alumnos pongan manos a la obra para definir conjuntamente los resultados por alcanzar, el contenido y los métodos de aprendizaje adecuados. La participación de los padres es primordial, ya que ayuda a promover el éxito educativo y las mejoras en las escuelas. Los centros de educación y forma- ción tienen una función en la prevención y lucha contra todo tipo de violencia dirigida contra los niños y jóve- nes, así como en los ámbitos de la protección de la salud, el bienestar y la cohesión social. En el marco estratégico actualizado para la cooperación europea en el ámbito de la educación y la forma- ción posterior a 2010 (Comisión Europea, 2008) ( 16 ), es importante desarrollar asociaciones entre los centros de educación y de formación ( 17 ) y las empresas, los institutos de investigación, los agentes culturales y las in- dustrias creativas para adquirir las capacidades y competencias que exige el mercado laboral y fomentar la in- novación. Las visitas de estudio considerarán enfoques y ejemplos de buenas prácticas relacionados con: (a) incentivos e iniciativas de ámbito nacional y regional que fomentan la colaboración de los centros de en- señanza y formación con interlocutores externos, incluidos padres, municipios, empresas, agentes socia- les, ONG, etc.; (b) ejemplos nacionales, regionales y locales de gestión participativa y evaluación de los centros de educa- ción y formación. (c) iniciativas para prevenir la violencia contra los niños y los jóvenes. 7.2. Lista de temas para las visitas de estudio • Cooperación entre centros de educación y formación y las comunidades locales. • Contribución de los padres y los agentes sociales a la gestión participativa. • Contribución de las escuelas y comunidades a la prevención de la violencia. 7.3.

Promoción de la movilidad transnacional en el aprendizaje permanente 8.1. Descripción Hacer realidad el aprendizaje permanente y la movilidad es un objetivo estratégico de la cooperación europea en materia de educación y formación después de 2010 (Consejo de la Unión Europea, 2009) ( 18 ). La construcción de un espacio europeo de educación es una prioridad para la Unión Europea, por motivos tanto culturales como económicos.

ropea y estimulando la ciudadanía europea. Desde un punto de vista práctico, ofrece a los jóvenes la oportu- nidad de mejorar sus capacidades personales y su empleabilidad, y a los profesores y formadores la posibili- dad de ampliar su experiencia y mejorar sus capacidades. Por último, en una economía internacional, la ca- pacidad de actualizar competencias y de trabajar en un entorno multilingüe es esencial para la competitividad de la economía europea. La Carta de calidad de la movilidad europea 2006 es el documento de referencia en materia de calidad para la educación y formación en el extranjero. Complementa la recomendación de 2001 sobre la movilidad de alum- nos, personal en prácticas, voluntarios, profesores y formadores. La Carta, aprobada por los Estados miem- bros, ofrece orientación sobre los mecanismos de movilidad con fines educativos y de otro tipo, como la me- jora profesional, tanto para jóvenes como para adultos. La Comisión Europea presentó en 2007 el nuevo programa de aprendizaje permanente , que sustituyó a los anteriores programas de educación, formación profesional y aprendizaje a distancia finalizados en 2006, ga- rantizando la continuidad de los programas Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci y Grundtvig. El programa promueve los intercambios y contactos entre personas físicas, centros y países. Las personas fí- sicas se benefician, por ejemplo, de los intercambios de alumnos, los cursos de formación continua en escue- las o en centros de educación para adultos, así como los períodos cortos de prácticas en empresas de otro país para estudiantes de formación profesional. Los intercambios entre centros incluyen, por ejemplo, activi- dades de colaboración entre escuelas de diferentes países, proyectos conjuntos gestionados por universida- des para la elaboración de programas de estudios comunes, programas intensivos de corta duración o la cre- ación de redes temáticas en diferentes disciplinas. Los intercambios entre países abarcan las visitas de estu- dio por parte de responsables regionales y nacionales de educación, formación y orientación, el establecimien- to de redes de expertos nacionales o la publicación de estadísticas comparativas sobre los sistemas de edu- cación y formación. El foro de expertos de alto nivel en movilidad creado por la Comisión Europea recomendó en julio de 2008 incrementar drásticamente las oportunidades de movilidad para los jóvenes a medio plazo. En 2020, al me- nos el 50 % de todos los jóvenes han de tener la posibilidad de participar en alguna iniciativa de movilidad trans- nacional durante sus estudios o formación, ya sea encontrando trabajo o bien trabajando de forma voluntaria. Para que esta oferta no se vea condicionada por determinadas circunstancias sociales, ha de abarcar una am- plitud de contextos de aprendizaje, como escuelas, universidades y centros de formación profesional, e incluir entornos de aprendizaje formal e informal. El foro propuso una acción estratégica para eliminar las barreras que frenan la movilidad, garantizar la igualdad y favorecer el intercambio de buenas prácticas. En julio de 2009, la Comisión Europea inició una consulta pública sobre el Libro Verde relativo al Fomento de la movilidad en la formación de los jóvenes ( 19 ). Dicho Libro Verde aborda cuestiones desde la preparación hasta el seguimiento de un periodo de movilidad. También considera las principales barreras y obstáculos que existen frente a la movilidad y pide que se presenten sugerencias y ejemplos de buenas prácticas para supe- rarlos. Además de las iniciativas mencionadas, se han desarrollado herramientas comunes para garantizar la trans- parencia de las cualificaciones y favorecer la movilidad entre diferentes países y sistemas en Europa. Entre ellas, figuran el marco europeo de cualificaciones para el aprendizaje permanente (MEC); el Sistema Europeo de Créditos para la Formación Profesional (ECVET); el Sistema Europeo de Transferencia y Acumulación de Créditos (ECTS) y Europass. 346 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 19 ) Comisión Europea.

CATALOGUE 2010/11 349 1. Schlüsselkompetenzen für alle, einschließlich, Kreativität, Innovation und Unternehmertum 1.1. Beschreibung In der Empfehlung des Europäischen Parlaments und des Rates zu Schlüsselkompetenzen für lebensbeglei- tendes Lernen (2006) wurde ein Rahmen festgelegt, der Kenntnisse mit Qualifikationen und Einstellungen ver- eint, die alle Menschen für ihre persönliche Entfaltung, für aktive Bürgerschaft, soziale Integration und Beschäf- tigung benötigen. Er dient als Referenzinstrument zur Unterstützung von politischen Entscheidungsträgern, Bil- dungs- und Ausbildungsanbietern, Arbeitgebern und Lernenden. Schlüsselkompetenzen haben für alle Altersgruppen Priorität. Junge Menschen sollten bis zum Ende der all- gemeinen und beruflichen Erstausbildung ausreichende Schlüsselkompetenzen erworben haben, um für das Erwachsenenleben gerüstet zu sein und über eine solide Grundlage für das Arbeitsleben und für weiteres Ler- nen zu verfügen. Erwachsene müssen ihre Schlüsselkompetenzen ihr Leben lang weiterentwickeln und aktua- lisieren, um sich flexibel an den raschen Wandel anpassen zu können. Zu den Schlüsselkompetenzen zählen muttersprachliche Kompetenz, Fremdsprachenkenntnisse, mathema- tische Kompetenz und grundlegende naturwissenschaftlich-technische Kompetenz, Computerkompetenz, Lern- kompetenz, soziale Kompetenz und Bürgerkompetenz, Eigeninitiative und unternehmerische Kompetenz, Kul- turbewusstsein und kulturelle Ausdrucksfähigkeit. In dem strategischen Rahmen für die europäische Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und be- ruflichen Bildung (ET 2020) ( 1 ) wird die Notwendigkeit, dass jeder Einzelne Schlüsselkompetenzen erwirbt, er- neut bekräftigt und zu einem strategischen Ziel erhoben, um Kreativität und Innovation sowie unter anderem unternehmerisches Denken auf allen Ebenen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung zu fördern. 2009 wurde zum Europäischen Jahr der Kreativität und Innovation ausgerufen, um das Bewusstsein für die Bedeutung von Kreativität und Innovation für die persönliche, soziale und wirtschaftliche Entwicklung zu schärfen. Bei den Studienbesuchen zu diesem Themenkreis werden Maßnahmen vorgestellt, die Teilnehmerländer er- greifen, um Schlüsselkompetenzen für junge Menschen und Erwachsene sowie kreative und innovative Kon- zepte für den Bereich der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung zu fördern. Beispiele für solche Maßnahmen sind: (a) nationale, regionale und lokale politische Strategien zur Verstärkung der Schlüsselkompetenzen und zur Unterstützung von Kreativität und Innovation; (b) Reformen der nationalen Curricula bzw. Erarbeitung regionaler und lokaler Schulcurricula; (c) spezifische Initiativen und Projekte zur Förderung des Erwerbs von Schlüsselkompetenzen, von Kreativi- tät und Innovation; (d) neue Ansätze für die Organisation von Lernen und Lehre; (e) innovative Methoden, Lernumgebungen, Lernmaterialien oder Bewertungstechniken. 1.2.

Verbesserung von Zugangsmöglichkeiten, Gleichbehandlung, Qualität und Effizienz in der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung 2.1. Beschreibung Zum Arbeitsprogramm „Allgemeine und berufliche Bildung 2010“ zählen verschiedene Maßnahmen und Initia- tiven, die alle auf die drei allgemeinen Ziele zur Verbesserung der europäischen Systeme der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung abheben, welche vom Europäischen Rat auf seiner Tagung im März 2001 in Stockholm ver- einbart wurden: • Verbesserung der Qualität und Wirksamkeit der Systeme der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung in der EU; • Erleichterung des Zugangs zur allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung für alle; 350 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS 
• Öffnung der Systeme der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung gegenüber der Welt. Diese Ziele fügen sich in die breiter gefassten europäischen Ziele ein, die in der Lissabon-Strategie für ein dauerhaftes Wirtschaftswachstum mit mehr und besseren Arbeitsplätzen und einem größeren sozialen Zusam- menhalt im Jahr 2000 festgelegt wurden. Obwohl einige positive Entwicklungen im Bereich der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung in den Mitgliedstaaten zu verzeichnen sind, werden die meisten Ziele nicht, wie vom Rat angestrebt, bis 2010 erreicht. Daher mahnte der Europäische Rat auf seiner Frühjahrstagung 2008 die Mitglied- staaten, Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um die Zahl der Schulabbrecher und der jungen Menschen mit unzureichen- den Lese- und Schreibfähigkeiten deutlich zu reduzieren. Außerdem wurden die Mitgliedstaaten aufgefordert, mehr Erwachsene, vor allem gering qualifizierte und ältere Arbeitnehmer, für die allgemeine und berufliche Bil- dung zu gewinnen, um das Bildungsniveau von Lernenden mit Migrationshintergrund oder aus benachteiligten Gruppen anzuheben sowie die geografische und berufliche Mobilität weiter zu erleichtern. Zu diesem Zweck müssten die Zugangsmöglichkeiten, die Gleichbehandlung und die Qualität und Effizienz der Systeme der all- gemeinen und beruflichen Bildung verbessert werden. Die Verbesserung von Qualität und Effizienz des Bildungssystems bleibt auch nach 2010 ein strategisches Ziel der europäischen Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung. In seinen Schluss- folgerungen zu einem strategischen Rahmen für diese Zusammenarbeit betonte der Rat, wie wichtig es ist, die Verwaltung und Leitung der Bildungs- und Ausbildungseinrichtungen zu optimieren und wirksame Qualitäts - sicherungssysteme zu entwickeln ( 2 ). Mit der Ausrufung des Jahres 2010 zum Europäischen Jahr zur Bekämpfung von Armut und sozialer Aus- grenzung soll für das Phänomen der sozialen Ausgrenzung sensibilisiert und die aktive Eingliederung gefördert werden. Zu den Prioritäten, die für dieses Jahr gesetzt wurden, gehören die Beseitigung von Benachteiligun- gen in Bildung und Ausbildung; die Berücksichtigung der Erfordernisse von Menschen mit Behinderungen, von Zuwanderern und ethnischen Minderheiten sowie Gruppen bzw. Personen in schwierigen Lagen und die Be- wältigung der geschlechts- und altersspezifischen Dimension sollen hierzu einen Beitrag leisten ( 3 ). Zugangsmöglichkeiten, Gleichbehandlung, Qualität und Effizienz beinhalten folgende Einzelaspekte: Zugang zu allgemeiner und beruflicher Bildung : Der Zugang zu Vorschulbildung ist für einen guten Start ins Leben wesentlich, da so die Sozialkompetenz der Kinder gefördert und eine Grundlage für weiteres Lernen ge- legt wird. Dies ist besonders wichtig für Kinder aus Familien, die über ein niedriges Einkommen verfügen, ei- ner ethnischen Minderheit angehören oder einen Migrationshintergrund haben. Die Mitgliedstaaten haben alternative (flexiblere) Formen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung, Nachqua- lifizierungsprogramme sowie Mechanismen zur Information von Eltern über Fehlzeiten eingeführt und die Kos- ten durch die Bereitstellung kostenloser Unterrichtsmaterialien und durch kostenlose Beförderung reduziert. Von Bedeutung ist auch eine enge Zusammenarbeit des Sektors der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung mit Aus- bildungsstätten des zweiten Bildungswegs für Erwachsene. Für Kinder mit besonderen Erfordernissen wird die Zugangsmöglichkeit zunehmend als Chance gesehen, eine allgemeinbildende Schule oder eine Förderschu- le zu besuchen, je nachdem, welche Option für das einzelne Kind die besten Lernmöglichkeiten bietet. Kos- tenlose Hochschulbildung ist ein entscheidender Faktor, denn Studiengebühren können ein Hindernis für den Zugang darstellen. Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten im Rahmen der Berufsbildung verschiedene Wege zur Förderung von Lernen und Beschäftigung entwickeln. Auch öffentliche Ausbildungsprogramme für Erwerbslose und benachteiligte Lernen- CATALOGUE 2010/11 351 ( 2 ) Rat der Europäischen Union, 2009, Schlussfolgerungen des Rates zu einem strategischen Rahmen für die europäische Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung (ET 2020), 9845/09, Brüssel, 13.05.2009.

de sollten verbessert werden. Die Qualität und praktische Bedeutung solcher Programme kann durch die För- derung von Partnerschaften mit Interessengruppen auf regionaler und lokaler Ebene und durch die Beteiligung des privaten Sektors optimiert werden. Die Erwachsenenbildung nimmt bei der Bekämpfung der sozialen Ausgrenzung eine zentrale Rolle ein. Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten effiziente Angebote der Erwachsenenbildung umsetzen, über die Erwachsenen Schlüs- selkompetenzen vermittelt werden und der Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt erleichtert wird. Die allgemeine und be- rufliche Bildung kann bei der Überwindung von sozioökonomischer Benachteiligung helfen, jedoch auch zu ih- rer Festigung beitragen. Gleichbehandlung : Alle Lernenden sollten die gleiche Chance auf Erfolg haben; Erfolg sollte nicht von Um- ständen abhängen, die sich dem Einfluss des Lernenden entziehen, z. B. von der finanziellen Situation der Fa- milie, der elterlichen Erziehung, dem Beschäftigungsstatus der Eltern, der geografischen Lage, der ethnischen und rassischen Zugehörigkeit, von Geschlecht oder Behinderungen. Im Bereich der Pflichtschulzeit wurde zu- dem der Möglichkeit der Nachqualifizierung für Schulabbrecher („zweite Chance“) große Aufmerksamkeit ge- schenkt. Die berufliche Erstausbildung zur Vermittlung von Kompetenzen, Kenntnissen und Qualifikationen ist für die Eingliederung dieser Schüler in die Gesellschaft von entscheidender Bedeutung. In den meisten Mitglied- staaten sind noch weitere Initiativen notwendig, um die Abbrecherquote zu senken und Ungleichheit aufgrund von sozioökonomischer Benachteiligung zu bekämpfen. Qualität : Die Gewährleistung hoher Qualitätsstandards ist auf allen Ebenen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung von wesentlicher Bedeutung. Die Ausrichtung auf Qualität beinhaltet die Stärkung der Kapazitäten von Lehrkräften, Schulleitern, Ausbildern und Ausbildungsleitern, Strategien zur besseren Verständigung mit den Eltern, die Modernisierung der Curricula und die Ausweitung außerschulischer Aktivitäten, die Verbesserung der Infrastruktur und die Schaffung eines respektvollen Umfelds. Die Einführung von Qualitätssicherungssystemen ist auf allen Bildungsebenen wichtig, unter anderem bei der Bewertung der Kompetenzen von Lernenden, bei institutionellen Selbstbewertungen, externen und internen Bewertungen, in Bezug auf Transparenz und die Va- lidierung von Ergebnissen. Immer häufiger werden beispielsweise Sozialpartner und Akteure des Arbeitsmarkts zu Bewertungen und zur Validierung von Ergebnissen hinzugezogen („Lerngemeinschaften“). Effizienz : Die zentralen Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung der institutionellen Effizienz und Anpassungsfähigkeit an sich ändernde Erfordernisse im Bereich der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung und auf dem Arbeitsmarkt sind: Dezentralisierung (einschließlich Reformen, um den Einrichtungen Spielraum für Eigeninitiative in der Bil- dung zu geben); Deregulierung; Überwachung von Leistungen anhand von Indikatoren für Bildungseffizienz; Bestandsaufnahme der Qualifikationslücken und Vorhersage von Qualifikationserfordernissen. Auch die Schaffung einer Bewertungskultur in allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildungssystemen, die bei der Suche nach Wegen zur effizienten (effizienteren) Nutzung der Ressourcen (Investitionen des öffentlichen und privaten Sek- tors) helfen soll, ist ein wesentlicher Faktor. Bei den Studienbesuchen werden Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen in folgenden Bereichen vorgestellt: (a) Entwicklung und Umsetzung von Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Zugangs zu allgemeiner und berufli- cher Bildung für benachteiligte Gruppen; (b) Planung und Durchführung von Maßnahmen zur Erzielung von Gleichbehandlung; (c) Planung und Umsetzung von Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der Qualität der Angebote im Bereich der allge- meinen und beruflichen Bildung; (d) Evaluierung und Analyse der Effizienz von Systemen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung. 352 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS

3. Attraktivität von Lehre und Lernen wahren und Führungsqualitäten verbessern 3.1. Beschreibung Die Verbesserung der Qualität von Lehre und Ausbildung in allen Mitgliedstaaten ist eines der zentralen Ziele des Arbeitsprogramms „Allgemeine und berufliche Bildung 2010“. In dem strategischen Rahmen für die euro- päische Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung ( 4 ) nach 2010 wird die Not- wendigkeit bekräftigt, einen Unterricht von hoher Qualität sicherzustellen und zu diesem Zweck eine adäqua- te Grundausbildung für Lehrer sowie Fortbildungsmöglichkeiten für Lehrer und Ausbilder zu bieten und die Lehr- berufe zu einer attraktiven Karriereoption zu machen. In zunehmendem Maße müssen Lehrkräfte und Ausbilder neue Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen entwickeln, um sich den Herausforderungen stellen zu können, die mit der größer werdenden Autonomie von Einrichtun- gen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung und Lernenden einhergehen. Weitere Anforderungen an Lehrkräf- te und Ausbilder ergeben sich aus dem Einsatz neuer Technologien und der Notwendigkeit, auf individuelle Ler- nerfordernisse einzugehen. Berufsbegleitende Weiterbildung von Lehrkräften schreiben nur elf Mitgliedstaaten verbindlich vor. Im Arbeitspapier der Dienststellen der Kommission „Schulen für das 21. Jahrhundert“ wird darauf hingewie- sen, dass die Anforderungen an die Lehrkräfte auch aufgrund von Stress und aggressivem Verhalten im Klas- senzimmer steigen. Diese Faktoren wirken sich in ihrer Gesamtheit negativ auf die Arbeitsleistung und die Zu- friedenheit aus und können dazu führen, dass Lehrkräfte frühzeitig aus dem Berufsleben ausscheiden. Viele ältere Lehrkräfte werden bald in den Ruhestand treten. Die Berufe im Bereich der Lehre und des le- benslangen Lernens müssen daher attraktiver gemacht werden, wobei darauf zu achten ist, neue Lehrkräfte einzustellen und gleichzeitig vorhandene zu halten. Die Mitgliedstaaten sind auf zwei Ebenen gefordert: Sie müs- sen zum einen der Herausforderung begegnen, verloren gehende Erfahrung zu ersetzen, und zum anderen die Chance wahrnehmen, in die Erstausbildung einer neuen Generation von Lehrkräften zu investieren und gleich- zeitig die Qualifikationen vorhandener Lehrkräfte und unterrichtender Leiter anzuheben. Die Verbesserung der Qualität der Schulleitung und die Förderung der Zusammenarbeit von Führungskräf- ten im Bildungswesen sind ebenfalls unerlässlich, wenn eine höhere Qualität der Bildung als Ganzes erreicht werden soll. 2007 betonte der Europäische Rat die Bedeutung des Zugangs zu qualitativ hochwertiger Ausbil- dung für die Schulleitung und das Management. Darüber hinaus brachte er die Hoffnung zum Ausdruck, dass eine Zusammenarbeit der Leiter von Bildungseinrichtungen zustande kommt, um sich den gemeinsamen He- rausforderungen der europäischen Bildungssysteme zu stellen. Die europäische Zusammenarbeit erfolgt im Rahmen eines freiwilligen Prozesses, der so genannten offe- nen Koordinierungsmethode. Seit 2004 werden gemeinsame Grundsätze für die Kompetenzen und Qualifika- tionen von Lehrkräften auf europäischer Ebene festgelegt. Auf diese Weise wird den politischen Entscheidungs- trägern in den Mitgliedstaaten die Bedeutung von hoch qualifizierten Arbeitskräften, von beruflicher Weiterent- wicklung, Mobilität der Lehrkräfte sowie von Partnerschaften zwischen Lehrkräften und anderen Stellen deut- lich gemacht. 2007 hob der Ministerrat erneut hervor, wie wichtig es ist, die Qualität der Lehrerausbildung zu verbessern, Lehrkräften Führungsqualitäten zu vermitteln und unterstützende Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um den Lehrberuf als Berufswahl attraktiver zu machen. Zu den von diesen Entwicklungen betroffenen Akteuren ge- hören Einrichtungen für die Ausbildung und Einstellung von Lehrkräften, Schulleiter und Bildungsanbieter, für die Registrierung, Aufsicht und Qualitätssicherung in Bezug auf Lehrkräfte zuständige Stellen, Sozialpartner wie Gewerkschaften sowie nationale und lokale politische Entscheidungsträger. 354 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 4 ) Rat der Europäischen Union, 2009, Schlussfolgerungen des Rates zu einem strategischen Rahmen für die europäische Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung (ET 2020), 9845/09, Brüssel, 13.05.2009.

Allgemeine und berufliche Bildung für Beschäftigungsfähigkeit 4.1. Beschreibung Die derzeitige Wirtschaftskrise in Europa erfordert sofortige und wirksame Maßnahmen, die die langfristige wirt- schaftliche und soziale Entwicklung fördern, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Beschäftigungsfähigkeit stärken und den sozialen Zusammenhalt festigen. In ihrer Mitteilung für die Frühjahrstagung des Europäischen Rates mit CATALOGUE 2010/11 355 
dem Titel Impulse für den Aufschwung in Europa ( 5 ) legte die Europäische Kommission mehrere Vorschläge vor, die die Mitgliedstaaten bei der Planung und Durchführung geeigneter und wirksamer Beschäftigungspolitiken unterstützen sollen. Sie setzte dabei drei Schlüsselprioritäten : Erhaltung und Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen und Förderung der Mobilität; Steigerung des Kompetenzniveaus und Anpassung an die Erfordernisse des Ar- beitsmarkts; Ausweitung des Zugangs zur Beschäftigung. Viele junge Menschen sind aufgrund ihres niedrigen Bildungsstands und unzureichender Qualifikationen vom Arbeitsmarkt ausgeschlossen. Die Umstrukturierung der Wirtschaft und sich ändernde Qualifikationserforder- nisse gefährden die Sicherheit von Arbeitsplätzen. Menschen müssen die Möglichkeit haben, in verschiedenen Lebensphasen Kenntnisse, Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen neu zu erwerben bzw. dem neuesten Stand an- zupassen. Dies ist besonders wichtig für Menschen in prekären Arbeitsverhältnissen, vom Verlust des Arbeits- platzes bedrohte Menschen und Arbeitslose, ältere oder gering qualifizierte Menschen, Menschen mit Migrati- onshintergrund oder Menschen mit Behinderungen. Obwohl die Beschäftigungsziele in Europa noch nicht erreicht sind und die Wirtschaftsentwicklung nicht be- sonders günstig ausfällt, besteht in einigen Ländern bereits ein Mangel an Qualifikationen. Europa wird sich in naher Zukunft möglicherweise auf ein größeres Qualifikationsdefizit einstellen müssen. Aufgrund der gestiege- nen Lebenserwartung und der rückläufigen Geburtenraten fließen dem Arbeitsmarkt weniger junge Menschen zu, während auf der anderen Seite das Arbeitsleben immer länger dauert. 2020 wird voraussichtlich bei 50 % aller Arbeitsplätze ein mittlerer, bei 31,5 % ein hoher Bildungsstand vorausgesetzt, während der Anteil der Ar- beitsplätze für Geringqualifizierte von einem Drittel im Jahr 1996 auf rund 18,5 % zurückgehen wird. Für viele derzeitige Arbeitsplätze werden sich die Anforderungen an die Qualifikationen ändern, was für die Menschen entweder die kontinuierliche Anpassung an diese Neuerungen bedeutet oder die Vorbereitung auf die Anfor- derungen an neuen Arbeitsplätzen. Die allgemeine und berufliche Erstausbildung liefert die Grundlage an Qualifikationen, auf der die weitere Bil- dung aufbaut. Der Erwerb von Wissen, Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen kann den Menschen dabei helfen, sie erfolgreich in Arbeit zu bringen und sich neuen, noch unbekannten Anforderungen, Arbeitsmethoden und Arbeitsplätzen anzupassen. Eine enge Zusammenarbeit mit Unternehmen kann dazu beitragen, die allgemeine und berufliche Bildung besser auf die Arbeitswelt abzustimmen. Lernen am Arbeitsplatz kann Lernende, die vielleicht die Schule vor- zeitig abbrechen würden, darin bestärken, ihren Bildungsweg fortzusetzen. Auf einem globalisierten und mo- bileren Arbeitsmarkt sind zudem sprachliche und kulturelle Kompetenzen vonnöten, um erfolgreich zu sein. Mangelnde berufsbezogene Sprachkenntnisse können es beispielsweise Migranten erschweren, (angemes- sene) Arbeitsplätze zu finden, oder kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen den Weg zu internationalen Märkten versperren. Bei der Wahl von geeigneten Bildungs- und Berufsbildungsprogrammen und Arbeitsplätzen sind Informatio- nen über die Qualifikationserfordernisse von Unternehmen sowie eine Beratung, bei der die Kompetenzen und Erfordernisse des Einzelnen berücksichtigt werden, unabdingbar. Um Menschen zu ermutigen, erstmalig oder wieder Lernangebote zu nutzen, und um Zeit und Kosten zu sparen, ist es außerdem wichtig, dass Einrichtun- gen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung und Arbeitgeber den Wert der am Arbeitsplatz, bei einer ehren- amtlichen Tätigkeit oder im Familienleben erworbenen Kenntnisse, Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen schätzen. Die Gewährleistung der Entwicklung von Qualifikationen ist auch wesentlicher Bestandteil des Flexicurity- Ansatzes. Diesem Konzept liegt die Überlegung zugrunde, dass die Beschäftigung aufrechterhalten bzw. er- leichtert werden kann, wenn häufiger Arbeitsplatzwechsel oder Karriereunterbrechungen in Kauf genommen wer- den. Dazu sind umfassende Strategien des lebenslangen Lernens notwendig, die alle Ebenen und Sektoren 356 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 5 ) Europäische Kommission, 2009, Mitteilung für die Frühjahrstagung des Europäischen Rates, Impulse für den Aufschwung in Europa, Teil 1, Brüssel, 4.3.2009, KOM(2009) 114 endgültig.

der Bildung berühren und die Politikfelder allgemeine und berufliche Bildung, Beschäftigung, Wirtschaft und So- ziales miteinander verbinden. Derartige Strategien haben noch nicht alle Länder umgesetzt. Zentraler Beweggrund vieler gemeinsamer Initiativen der Europäischen Kommission, der Mitgliedstaaten und der europäischen Sozialpartner ist es, einen Beitrag zur Gewährleistung der Beschäftigungsfähigkeit von Men- schen zu leisten. Beispiele für die wichtigsten politischen Initiativen auf europäischer Ebene sind: Schlüsselkompetenzen für lebensbegleitendes Lernen: Der Rat der Europäischen Union und das Europäi- sche Parlament empfahlen den Mitgliedstaaten ( 6 ), Lernende in die Lage zu versetzen, Schlüsselkompetenzen zu erwerben, die sie bei der Anpassung an die sich ändernden Erfordernisse des Arbeitsmarkts unterstützen und es ihnen ermöglichen, einen aktiven Beitrag zur Gesellschaft zu leisten. Berufsbildung: Die im Jahr 2002 im Anschluss an die Lissabon-Strategie und die Zusammenarbeit im Bereich der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung unterzeichnete Kopenhagener Erklärung bildete den Ausgangspunkt für eine engere Zusammenarbeit zwischen der Kommission, den Mitgliedstaaten und den europäischen Sozi- alpartnern in der Berufsbildung. Die Berufsbildung ist von entscheidender Bedeutung, wenn es darum geht, le- benslanges Lernen sicherzustellen und den Erfordernissen des Arbeitsmarkts angepasste qualifizierte Arbeits- kräfte auszubilden. Der Kopenhagen-Prozess zielt darauf ab, den Zugang zu lebenslangem Lernen zu erleich- tern und die ausbildungsbezogene, berufliche und geografische Mobilität zu fördern. Dieser Prozess war der Auslöser für bedeutende Innovationen mit direkter oder indirekter Auswirkung auf die Verbesserung der Beschäf- tigungsfähigkeit, unter anderem gemeinsame Grundsätze zur Steigerung der Transparenz von Qualifikationen, Qualitätssicherung in der Berufsbildung, lebenslange Bildungs- und Berufsberatung und Validierung von nicht formalem und informellem Lernen. Die für die berufliche Aus- und Weiterbildung zuständigen Minister der EU-Mitgliedstaaten legten 2008 im Bor- deaux-Kommuniqué als neues Ziel fest, die Verbindungen zwischen der Berufsbildung und dem Arbeitsmarkt zu stärken, und knüpften damit an die Initiative „Neue Kompetenzen für neue Beschäftigungen“ an, bei der es darum geht, die Nachfrage nach Arbeitskräften und Qualifikationen zu antizipieren und besser mit dem Ange- bot in Einklang zu bringen ( 7 ). Hochschulbildung : Das Ziel des Bologna-Prozesses ist es, bis 2010 einen Europäischen Hochschulraum zu schaffen, in dem Lernende aus einem breiten und transparenten Angebot qualitativ hochwertiger Studiengän- ge auswählen können und von reibungslosen Anerkennungsverfahren profitieren. Der Bologna-Prozess sieht die Umsetzung eines Systems vor, das im Wesentlichen auf drei Zyklen beruht (Bachelor-Grad, Master-Grad, Promotion). Der Abschluss der ersten Stufe ist ein dem europäischen Arbeitsmarkt angepasster Qualifikations- grad. Die zweite Stufe soll zum Master-Abschluss bzw. zur Promotion führen, wie es in vielen europäischen Län- dern der Fall ist. Zur Stärkung der Beschäftigungsfähigkeit gewinnen Verbindungen zwischen Berufs- und Hochschulbildung im Rahmen des lebenslangen Lernens immer mehr an Bedeutung. Die Möglichkeit des Zugangs zum Tertiär- bereich ist für den Lernenden ein wichtiger Grund, sich für die Berufsbildung zu entscheiden. Die Mitgliedstaa- ten haben erste Initiativen zur engeren Verknüpfung der Hochschul- und Berufsbildungssysteme ergriffen.

Erwachsenenbildung: Der Rat betont in seinen Schlussfolgerungen zur Erwachsenenbildung (2008), dass es sowohl für die Beschäftigungsfähigkeit als auch für die soziale Eingliederung entscheidend ist, dass Erwach- sene im Lernprozess verbleiben und sich Änderungen anpassen. Kontinuierliche Weiterqualifizierung, Umschu- lung und Weiterentwicklung von Kompetenzen sind wesentliche Voraussetzungen für die aktive Beteiligung an der Gesellschaft. In seinen Schlussfolgerungen zu neuen Kompetenzen für neue Beschäftigungen (2009) stellt der Rat fest, dass Investitionen in Kompetenzen auf allen Ebenen und die Bereitstellung eines qualitativ hochwertigen Bildungs- angebots für alle in Anbetracht der derzeitigen Wirtschaftskrise, des globalen Wettbewerbs, des technologischen Wandels hin zu einer CO 2-armen Wirtschaft und der Alterung der Bevölkerung kurzfristig für Europas Aufschwung und längerfristig für Wachstum und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit sowie Gleichbehandlung und sozialen Zusammen- halt in Europa von entscheidender Bedeutung ist. Die Mitgliedstaaten sind unbedingt bei der Vorhersage künf- tiger Qualifikationserfordernisse für Arbeitnehmer und Arbeitgeber in der EU zu unterstützen, und zu diesem Zweck sind regelmäßige Prognosen der Entwicklungen auf den lokalen, regionalen, nationalen und europäi- schen Arbeitsmärkten vorzunehmen und die Qualifikationserfordernisse nach Sektoren zu analysieren ( 8 ). Der Flexicurity -Ansatz zielt darauf ab, Flexibilität (flexibility) und Sicherheit (security) auf dem Arbeitsmarkt in Einklang zu bringen, und ermöglicht es sowohl Arbeitnehmern als auch Arbeitgebern, die Chancen der Globa- lisierung zu nutzen. Die allgemeinen Grundsätze des Flexicurity-Ansatzes lauten: umfassende Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen, wirksame aktive arbeitsmarktpolitische Strategien, Erleichterung des beruflichen Aufstiegs und der Mobilität zwischen Phasen der Arbeitslosigkeit oder der wirtschaftlichen Inaktivität und der Beschäfti- gung, kontinuierliche Aktualisierung von Qualifikationen. Die europäischen Sozialpartner haben einen eigenen Aktionsrahmen für die Entwicklung von Kompetenzen des lebenslangen Lernens und Qualifikationen entworfen, unterstützen jedoch auch die Kommission und die Mitgliedstaaten dabei, die Berufsbildung in Europa zu verbessern und attraktiver zu gestalten. Bei den Studienbesuchen werden Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen im Bereich der allgemeinen und berufli- chen Bildung zur Stärkung der Beschäftigungsfähigkeit vorgestellt: (a) Beitrag der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung zur Verbesserung von Kenntnissen, Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen für den Arbeitsmarkt; (b) Analyse von Qualifikationserfordernissen und - lücken, die auf den Arbeitsmärkten der EU-Mitgliedstaaten entstehen, und Ausarbeitung von politischen Problemlösungen; (c) Planung und Umsetzung von Aktivitäten wie den Übergang von der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung zum Arbeitsleben, Berufsberatung und Lernen am Arbeitsplatz zur Verbesserung der Beschäftigungsfähig- keit. 4.2.

Einführung gemeinsamer europäischer Instrumente, Grundsätze und Rahmen für lebenslanges Lernen; einschließlich lebensbegleitender 5.1. Beschreibung Zur Förderung sowohl der Mobilität der Bürger Europas als auch ihrer Qualifikationen und Lernleistungen wur- den oder werden zurzeit mehrere gemeinsame Instrumente, Grundsätze und Rahmen auf europäischer Ebe- ne entwickelt, um die Ziele von Lissabon zu erreichen ( 9 ). Sie alle dienen dem Zweck, die Zusammenarbeit in Europa zu stärken und in allen Bereichen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung Transparenz, Anerkennung und Qualitätssicherung zu verbessern. Der Europäische Qualifikationsrahmen (EQR) ist ein gemeinsamer europäischer Referenzrahmen, der die Qualifikationen in den einzelnen Ländern miteinander verbindet, um sie über Länder- und Systemgrenzen hin- weg in Europa besser vergleichbar und verständlicher zu machen. Er verfolgt dabei zwei Kernziele: Förderung der grenzüberschreitenden Mobilität von Bürgern und Unterstützung des lebenslangen Lernens. Immer mehr Länder in Europa erstellen nationale Qualifikationsrahmen (NQR), die sich eng, aber nicht ausschließlich am EQR orientieren, und setzen diese um. Die Regierungen streben an, übergeordnete Rahmen für Qualifikationen zu entwickeln, die Lernergebnisse aus verschiedenen Bereichen beispielsweise aus Schule, Beruf, Hochschule und Erwachsenenbildung darstel- len. Diese neuen Rahmen sind oft mit Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen verknüpft und sollen die Bildungs- systeme für die Bereiche des informellen Lernens oder der Erfahrung erschließen, deren Anerkennung die Ler- nenden wünschen. 2004 wurden gemeinsame europäische Grundsätze für die Validierung von nicht formalem und informellem Lernen festgelegt. 2009 folgte die Ausarbeitung dieser Grundsätze in einem Leitfaden, der als praktisches Hilfsmittel für die Entwicklung und Umsetzung von Methoden und Systemen zur Validierung in den Mitgliedstaaten dient ( 10 ). Der EQR dient außerdem als gemeinsamer europäischer Bezugspunkt für die im Bildungswesen tätigen in- ternationalen Organisationen, die länderübergreifend eigene Qualifikationen entwickeln möchten. Auf diese Wei- se kann auch eine Verbindung zwischen den langfristigen Qualifikationserfordernissen des Arbeitsmarkts und den Politiken für die Bereiche Aus- und Weiterbildung hergestellt werden, um eine bessere Anpassung an glo- 360 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 9 ) Arbeitsprogramm „Allgemeine und berufliche Bildung 2010“ (Beitrag zur Lissabon-Strategie).

balisierungsbedingte Änderungen und Umstrukturierungen zu erreichen. Die meisten europäischen Länder ent- wickeln zurzeit übergreifende nationale Qualifikationsrahmen (NQR), die alle Untersysteme unter einem Dach vereinen sollen. Ein nationaler Qualifikationsrahmen ist ein Instrument, mit dem die Kohärenz der Entwicklung von politischen Strategien und des lebenslangen Lernens zur Verbesserung der Zugangsmöglichkeiten, der Wei- terentwicklung und Anerkennung von Lernergebnissen gefördert werden soll. Der Europass ( 11 ) wurde entwickelt, um den Bürgern dabei zu helfen, ihr Wissen, ihre Kompetenzen und Qua- lifikationen in klarer und leicht verständlicher Form nachzuweisen, und um die europaweite Mobilität zu fördern. Er setzt sich aus fünf Dokumenten zusammen: Lebenslauf, Sprachenpass, Mobilitätsnachweis, Zeugniserläu- terung und Diplomzusatz. Die Transparenz von Qualifikationen und die Anerkennung von Lernergebnissen werden zudem durch Instru- mente gefördert, die Lernenden die Anrechnung von Lernleistungen, die sie während Lernperioden im eigenen Land oder im Ausland erbracht haben, erleichtern sollen. Diese Instrumente sind: das Europäische Leistungs- punktesystem für die Berufsbildung (ECVET) und das Europäische System zur Übertragung von Stu - dienleistungen (ECTS) in der Hochschulbildung. 2009 verabschiedeten das Europäische Parlament und der Rat die Empfehlung zur Einrichtung eines europäischen Leistungspunktesystems für die Berufsbildung (ECVET) ( 12 ). 2009 verabschiedeten das Europäische Parlament und der Rat eine Empfehlung zur Einrichtung eines eu- ropäischen Bezugsrahmens für die Qualitätssicherung in der beruflichen Aus- und Weiterbildung ( 13 ); für den Bereich der Hochschulbildung lagen bereits gemeinsame Standards vor. Die Empfehlung sieht mehrere Qua- litätskriterien und als Richtgrößen zu verstehende Deskriptoren sowie Referenzindikatoren für die Qualität der beruflichen Bildung vor. Qualitativ hochwertige Beratungsdienste unterstützen die Bürger beim lebenslangen Lernen, beim Karriere- management und bei der Verwirklichung persönlicher Ziele. Die lebenslange Bildungs- und Berufsberatung leis- tet einen Beitrag zur Umsetzung der umfassenderen Ziele Vollbeschäftigung, hohes Bildungsniveau und Wirt- schaftswachstum. 2008 verabschiedete der Rat der Europäischen Union eine Entschließung zu einer besse- ren Integration lebensumspannender Beratung in die Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen ( 14 ), in der die Bedeu- tung der lebenslangen Bildungs- und Berufsberatung im Rahmen der Ausarbeitung und Durchführung politischer Strategien in den Bereichen Bildung, Ausbildung und Beschäftigung bekräftigt wurde. Bei den Studienbesuchen werden europäische Instrumente, Grundsätze und Rahmen für das lebenslange Lernen vorgestellt, unter anderem: (a) Erstellung und Umsetzung von Qualifikationsrahmen, die sich am EQR orientieren; (b) Förderung des Europasses und dessen Verwendung durch Aus- und Weiterbildungseinrichtungen, Bera- tungs- und Arbeitsvermittlungsdienste und Bürger; (c) Planung und Umsetzung von Qualitätssicherungsrahmen in Anlehnung an den Europäischen Bezugsrah- men für die Qualitätssicherung; (d) Instrumente für die Anrechnung von Studienleistungen, um die Mobilität der Lernenden zu fördern; (e) Grundsätze für die Anerkennung des nicht formalen und informellen Lernens; (f) Förderung politischer Maßnahmen im Bereich der lebenslangen Bildungs- und Berufsberatung zur Unter- stützung nationaler/regionaler Beratungsdienste.

Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen – Trends und Handlungsbedarf 6.1. Beschreibung Die derzeitige Wirtschaftskrise in Europa macht deutlich, wie wichtig allgemeine und berufliche Bildung für den Aufschwung der Region sind. Flexibilität und Sicherheit sind Voraussetzung für die Schaffung von mehr und bes- seren Arbeitsplätzen und können nur erreicht werden, wenn sichergestellt ist, dass alle Bürger Schlüsselkom- petenzen erwerben und ihre Kompetenzen ihr Leben lang weiterentwickeln. Das lebenslange Lernen fördert Krea- tivität und Innovation und ermöglicht die vollständige Teilnahme am wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Leben. Aus diesem Grund haben die EU-Mitgliedstaaten und die Europäische Kommission in den vergangenen Jahren ihre politische Zusammenarbeit mit dem Arbeitsprogramm „Allgemeine und berufliche Bildung 2010“, das zur Errei- chung der Ziele von Lissabon und zur Förderung des lebenslangen Lernens beitragen soll, erheblich ausge- baut. Das Programm für lebenslanges Lernen 2007-2013 integriert auf europäischer Ebene frühere Aktionen im Bereich der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung, einschließlich der Berufsbildung im Rahmen des Kopen- hagen-Prozesses, und stellt die Verbindung zum Bologna-Prozess her, der für den Aufbau eines europäischen Hochschulraums (EHR) von zentraler Bedeutung ist. Bei dem Arbeitsprogramm „Allgemeine und berufliche Bildung 2010“ wird die offene Koordinierungsmetho- de (OKM) als strategischer Rahmen für die Zusammenarbeit der Kommission mit den Mitgliedstaaten angewandt. Die OKM bietet die Möglichkeit, Wissen über Beispiele bewährter Praxis zu verbreiten und eine bessere An- gleichung an die Hauptziele der EU durch folgende Maßnahmen zu erreichen: • Ermittlung und Definition gemeinsamer Zielvorgaben; • gemeinsame Definition von Benchmarks und Indikatoren, anhand deren sich die Mitgliedstaaten mit ande- ren Mitgliedstaaten vergleichen und ihren Fortschritt bei der Erreichung der Zielvorgaben bewerten können; • Förderung des Austauschs und der Verbreitung von Informationen über bewährte Praktiken, wie Peer-Lear- ning-Aktivitäten. Die Europäische Kommission hat die europäische Zusammenarbeit im Bereich der allgemeinen und beruf- lichen Bildung kürzlich in Abstimmung mit den Mitgliedstaaten einer Überprüfung unterzogen und folgende stra- tegische Prioritäten für die Zusammenarbeit bis 2020 gesetzt: • Verwirklichung des lebenslangen Lernens und der Mobilität, • Verbesserung der Qualität und Wirksamkeit der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung, • Förderung von Chancengleichheit, sozialem Zusammenhalt und aktiver Bürgerschaft, • Verbesserung von Kreativität und Innovation sowie von unternehmerischem Denken auf allen Ebenen der all- gemeinen und beruflichen Bildung. Die Zusammenarbeit sollte sich auf das Lernen in allen formalen, nicht formalen oder informellen Umgebun- gen beziehen: angefangen bei der frühkindlichen Erziehung über Schulbildung bis hin zur Hochschulbildung, Berufsbildung und Erwachsenenbildung ( 15 ).

Der Austausch von Informationen über verschiedene politische Alternativen kann sich positiv auf die Durch- führung von Reformen nationaler Systeme der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung auswirken und zusammen mit anderen gemeinsamen Lernaktivitäten die Erreichung der gemeinsamen Ziele und Benchmarks für lebens- langes Lernen vorantreiben. Die meisten Länder haben bei der Festlegung einheitlicher und übergeordneter Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen Fortschritte gemacht. Dies zeigt sich deutlich innerhalb solcher Rahmen an der Vorschulbildung, der Va- lidierung des nicht formalen und informellen Lernens und insbesondere der nationalen Qualifikationsrahmen (NQR), die die Mehrheit der EU-Mitgliedstaaten analog zum EQR auf der Grundlage der Lernergebnisse er- stellen. Trotz des Fortschritts in den genannten Bereichen besteht weiterer Handlungsbedarf, damit übergeordnete Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen umgesetzt werden können. Noch steht die Durchführung kohärenter und umfassender Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen aus, die die Bereiche Bildung, Hochschulbildung, Erwachsenenbildung und Berufsbildung umfassen. Hierbei ist ein ganz- heitlicher Ansatz, der lebenslanges Lernen und berufliche Bildung mit anderen Politikfeldern wie Makroökono- mie, Beschäftigung, Wettbewerb, Unternehmen, Forschung und Innovation sowie Sozialpolitik verknüpft, von entscheidender Bedeutung. Eine der größten Herausforderungen bei NQR besteht darin, dass sie als Integrationsinstrumente zur Schaf- fung von Bildungswegen durch alle Sektoren der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung und zur Anerkennung von in nicht formalen und informellen Umfeldern, unter anderem am Arbeitsplatz, erworbenen Lernergebnissen als Basis für weiteres Lernen, fungieren können müssen. Die Beteiligung der Erwachsenen am lebenslangen Lernen ist noch weit vom EU-Richtwert entfernt. Verstärk- te Bemühungen sind erforderlich, um ihre Kompetenzen in verschiedenen Lebensabschnitten weiterzuentwi- ckeln, ihren Zugang zu allgemeiner und beruflicher Bildung zu verbessern, ihre Lernergebnisse bewerten zu lassen, die Qualität der Angebote zu optimieren sowie Flexibilität und Sicherheit auf dem gesamten Arbeitsmarkt zu erreichen. Ein niedriges Bildungsniveau und unzureichende Qualifikationen sind die Hauptfaktoren für soziale Ausgren- zung und mangelnden Erfolg auf dem Arbeitsmarkt. Dies gilt insbesondere für ältere Arbeitnehmer, Geringqua- lifizierte und andere benachteiligte Gruppen (z. B. Migranten), die vom Verlust ihres Arbeitsplatzes bedroht sind oder keinen Arbeitsplatz finden können. Die demografische Entwicklung und die Entwicklung auf dem Arbeits- markt bewirken eine Verstärkung der Nachfrage nach hoch qualifizierten Arbeitskräften und die Verknappung der Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten für Arbeitnehmer mit geringer Qualifikation. Um diese Herausforderung zu meis- tern ist es notwendig, weitere Investitionen in Human- und Sozialkapital zu tätigen und die Teilnahme am le- benslangen Lernen zu fördern. Bei den Studienbesuchen werden Entwicklungen in folgenden Bereichen vorgestellt: (a) Reformen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung, politische Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung der integrier- ten Strategien für lebenslanges Lernen; (b) politische Maßnahmen zur Förderung der Beteiligung von Erwachsenen am lebenslangen Lernen; (c) Einführung flexibler Bildungswege und Übergänge zwischen verschiedenen Bereichen der nationalen Sys- teme. 6.2.

Entwicklung von Lerngemeinschaften, Beteiligung aller Akteure der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung 7.1. Beschreibung Die allgemeine und berufliche Bildung in Europa erfüllt mehrere wichtige Aufgaben in unserer Gesellschaft. Sie bietet den Lernenden nicht nur das Wissen, die Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen, die sie für die Ausübung ei- nes Berufs oder einer Tätigkeit benötigen, sondern unterstützt auch die Entwicklung von Kompetenzen, die für das Familien- und Sozialleben wichtig sind. Die Öffnung der Systeme der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung ist eines der drei strategischen Ziele des Arbeitsprogramms, auf das sich die europäischen Bildungsminister verständigt haben, um Europa zu einer wis- sensbasierten Gesellschaft zu machen (Lissabon-Strategie). In ihrer Mitteilung Bessere Kompetenzen für das 21. Jahrhundert: eine Agenda für die europäische Zusammenarbeit im Schulwesen betont die Europäische Kom- mission die Bedeutung von „Lerngemeinschaften“, die Partnerschaften mit Agenturen, Organisationen und an- deren Akteuren außerhalb des „klassischen“ Schulumfelds beinhalten. Auf diese Weise wird die Verantwortlichkeit der Einrichtungen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung ge- genüber den Partnern gestärkt, und Vertreter des Arbeitsmarkts, Familien, bürgerschaftliche und ökologische CATALOGUE 2010/11 365 
Organisationen sowie Lernende haben die Möglichkeit, gemeinsam über angestrebte Ergebnisse, Inhalte und geeignete Formen des Lernens zu entscheiden. Darüber hinaus ist die Elternbeteiligung überaus wichtig, weil sie einen Beitrag zum Bildungserfolg und zu schulischen Verbesserungen leistet. Die Einrichtungen der allge- meinen und beruflichen Bildung können außerdem zur Prävention und Bekämpfung aller Formen von Gewalt gegen Kinder und junge Menschen beitragen sowie Gesundheitsschutz, Wohlbefinden und sozialen Zusam- menhalt auf hohem Niveau erreichen. Innerhalb des aktualisierten strategischen Rahmens für die europäische Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung in der Zeit nach 2010 ( 16 ) ist die Gründung von Partnerschaften der Bildungs- und Ausbildungseinrichtungen ( 17 ) mit Unternehmen, Forschungseinrichtungen, kulturellen Akteuren und kreativen Branchen wichtig, um auf dem Arbeitsmarkt verlangte Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen zu er- werben und Innovation zu fördern. Bei den Studienbesuchen werden Ansätze und Beispiele bewährter Praxis vorgestellt: (a) Anreize und Initiativen, die auf nationaler und regionaler Ebene für die Einrichtungen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung entwickelt wurden, damit diese mit externen Partnern, wie Eltern, Kommunen, Unter- nehmen, Sozialpartnern, Nichtregierungsorganisationen (NRO) usw. zusammenarbeiten; (b) nationale, regionale und lokale Beispiele für partizipative Führung und Bewertung von Einrichtungen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung; (c) Initiativen zur Prävention von Gewalt gegen Kinder und junge Menschen. 7.2.

Förderung der grenzüberschreitenden Mobilität beim lebenslangen Lernen 8.1. Beschreibung Die Verwirklichung des lebenslangen Lernens und der Mobilität ist ein strategisches Ziel der europäischen Zu- sammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung nach 2010 ( 18 ). Der Aufbau eines echten europäischen Bildungsraums hat für die Europäische Union sowohl aus kulturellen als auch aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen hohe Priorität. Die Mobilität der Bürger, insbesondere bei der allgemei- nen und beruflichen Bildung, trägt dazu bei, ein Zugehörigkeitsgefühl zu Europa, ein europäisches Bewusst- sein und eine europäische Bürgerschaft zu fördern. Konkret bedeutet dies für junge Menschen, dass sie ihre persönlichen Kompetenzen und ihre Beschäftigungsfähigkeit stärken können, und für Lehrkräfte und Ausbilder, dass sie ihren Erfahrungsschatz erweitern und ihre Kompetenzen verbessern können. In einer internationalen Wirtschaft ist schließlich die Fähigkeit, selbständig zu lernen und in einer mehrsprachigen Umgebung zu arbei- ten, eine Voraussetzung für die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der europäischen Wirtschaft. Die Europäische Qualitätscharta für Mobilität aus dem Jahr 2006 dient als Bezugsdokument für die Quali- tät von Auslandsaufenthalten zur Bildung und Ausbildung. Sie ergänzt die Empfehlung von 2001 zur Mobilität von Studierenden, in der Ausbildung tätigen Personen, Freiwilligen, Lehrkräften und Ausbildern. Die von den Mitgliedstaaten verabschiedete Charta gibt Orientierungshilfen für Mobilitätsmaßnahmen für Jugendliche und Erwachsene, zum Lernen oder zu sonstigen Zwecken, wie der Verbesserung ihrer beruflichen Fähigkeiten. 2007 brachte die Europäische Kommission das neue Programm für lebenslanges Lernen auf den Weg. Die- ses Programm ersetzte frühere 2006 ausgelaufene Programme in den Bereichen allgemeine und berufliche Bil- dung und eLearning, so dass die Programme Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci und Grundtvig fortgesetzt werden konnten. Das Programm für lebenslanges Lernen unterstützt den Austausch und Verbindungen zwischen Personen, Einrichtungen und Ländern. Zu den Programmen für Einzelpersonen gehören der Studentenaustausch, berufs- CATALOGUE 2010/11 367 ( 18 ) Rat der Europäischen Union, 2009, Schlussfolgerungen des Rates zu einem strategischen Rahmen für die europäische Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung (ET 2020), 9845/09, Brüssel, 13.05.2009: http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/de/ 09/st09/st09845.de09.pdf 
begleitende Fortbildungskurse in Schulen oder in der Erwachsenenbildung und Teilnahme an speziellen Kurz- praktika für Berufsschüler in Unternehmen im Ausland. Der Austausch zwischen Einrichtungen umfasst die Grün- dung von Partnerschaften zwischen Schulen in verschiedenen Ländern, Gemeinschaftsprojekte von Universi- täten zur Erarbeitung gemeinsamer Curricula, Intensivprogramme mit kurzer Laufzeit oder die Bildung thema- tischer Netzwerke in verschiedenen Fächern. Verbindungen zwischen Ländern werden gefördert durch Studi- enbesuche, die sich an Verwaltungsmitarbeiter aus den Bereichen allgemeine und berufliche Bildung sowie Be- ratung der regionalen und nationalen Ebene richten, Netzwerke nationaler Sachverständiger oder Veröffentli- chung von Vergleichsstatistiken zu Systemen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung. Die Europäische Kommission hat ein hochrangiges Expertenforum für Mobilität ins Leben gerufen, das im Juli 2008 die Empfehlung aussprach, Maßnahmen zur deutlichen Verbesserung der Mobilität von jungen Men- schen zu ergreifen. Bis 2020 sollten mindestens 50 % aller jungen Menschen in der Lage sein, im Rahmen ih- res Studiums, ihrer Ausbildung, eines Praktikums oder einer ehrenamtlichen Tätigkeit eine Form der grenzüber- schreitenden Mobilität zu nutzen. Dieses Angebot sollte unabhängig vom sozialen Hintergrund wahrgenommen werden können und sich auf verschiedene Lernumgebungen, wie Schule, Universität und Berufsschule, sowie andere formale und informelle Lernumgebungen erstrecken. Das Expertenforum empfahl strategische Maßnah- men zur Beseitigung von Hindernissen für Mobilität, zur Qualitätssicherung und zum Austausch von Beispie- len bewährter Praxis. Im Juli 2009 leitete die Europäische Kommission eine öffentliche Konsultation zum Grünbuch über die För- derung der Mobilität junger Menschen zu Lernzwecken ein ( 19 ). In diesem Grünbuch werden verschiedene As- pekte von der Vorbereitung bis zur Nachbereitung von Mobilitätsphasen behandelt. Zudem werden die wich- tigsten Hindernisse für Mobilität beleuchtet und Anregungen und Beispiele bewährter Praxis zur Beseitigung die- ser Hindernisse erbeten. Zusätzlich zu den genannten Initiativen werden gemeinsame Instrumente entwickelt, die die Transparenz von Qualifikationen und die Mobilität in Europa über Länder- und Systemgrenzen hinweg verbessern sollen. Hier- zu gehören der Europäische Qualifikationsrahmen für lebenslanges Lernen (EQR), das Europäische Leistungs- punktesystem für die Berufsbildung (ECVET), das Europäisches System zur Übertragung von Studienleistun- gen (ECTS) und der Europass. Bei den Studienbesuchen werden Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung der Mobilität zum Zwe- cke des lebenslangen Lernens vorgestellt: (a) Initiativen und Projekte für Mobilität zu Lernzwecken in verschiedenen Lernumgebungen; (b) Initiativen und Projekte zur Förderung des größtmöglichen Zugangs zu Mobilitätsmaßnahmen für Einzel- personen; (c) Initiativen, die dazu beitragen, Qualifikationen in Europa über Länder- und Systemgrenzen hinweg klarer und verständlicher zu machen; (d) neue Ansätze, die die Validierung und Anerkennung von im Zuge der Mobilität erworbenen Kenntnissen, Qualifikationen und Kompetenzen vereinfachen; (e) Werbung für den Europass und seine Verwendung durch Einrichtungen der allgemeinen und beruflichen Bildung, Arbeitsvermittlungsdienste und Bürger; (f) Instrumente für die Anrechnung und Anerkennung von Lernergebnissen, um die Mobilität der Lernenden zu erhöhen. 368 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 19 ) Grünbuch, Die Mobilität junger Menschen zu Lernzwecken fördern, KOM(2009) 329 endgültig.

1. Des compétences clés pour tous, dont la créativité, le sens de l’innovation et l’esprit d’entreprise 1.1. Description La recommandation du Parlement européen et du Conseil sur les compétences clés pour lʼéducation et la for- mation tout au long de la vie (2006) a défini un cadre combinant les connaissances, compétences et attitudes dont tous les individus ont besoin pour leur épanouissement personnel, la citoyenneté active, lʼinsertion sociale et lʼemploi. Il sʼagit dʼun outil de référence sur lequel peuvent sʼappuyer les responsables politiques, les pres- tataires dʼenseignement et de formation, les employeurs et les apprenants. Les compétences clés sont une priorité pour tous les groupes dʼâge. Les jeunes doivent avoir acquis des com- pétences clés à la fin de leur éducation et formation initiales pour être suffisamment préparés à la vie adulte et dotés de moyens de base appropriés pour lʼenseignement ultérieur et la vie professionnelle. Les adultes doi- vent développer et actualiser leurs compétences clés tout au long de leur vie afin de sʼadapter aisément à un environnement en mutation rapide. Les compétences clés sont les suivantes: communication dans la langue maternelle, communication dans une langue étrangère, culture mathématique et compétences de base en sciences et technologies, compétence numérique, capacité dʼapprendre à apprendre, compétences sociales et civiques, sens de lʼinitiative et esprit dʼentreprise, sensibilité et expression culturelles. Le cadre stratégique pour la coopération européenne dans le domaine de lʼéducation et de la formation («Édu- cation et formation 2020») ( 1 ) a renforcé la nécessité pour tout individu dʼacquérir des compétences clés, en lʼénonçant parmi les objectifs stratégiques visant à encourager la créativité et lʼinnovation, y compris lʼesprit dʼen- treprise, à tous les niveaux de lʼéducation et de la formation. LʼAnnée européenne de la créativité et de lʼinnovation (2009) vise à mieux faire connaître lʼimportance de la créativité et de lʼinnovation pour le développement personnel, social et économique. Les participants aux visites dʼétude sur ce thème se familiariseront avec les mesures prises par les pays par- ticipants en vue de développer les compétences clés des jeunes et des adultes et de promouvoir les approches créatives et innovantes dans lʼéducation et la formation, mesures parmi lesquelles figurent entre autres: (a) des politiques locales, régionales et nationales visant à relever le niveau des compétences clés et à pro- mouvoir la créativité et lʼinnovation; (b) des réformes nationales des programmes ou des évolutions régionales et locales des programmes scolaires; (c) des initiatives et projets spécifiques destinés à promouvoir le développement des compétences clés, la créa- tivité et lʼinnovation; (d) de nouvelles approches de lʼorganisation de lʼapprentissage et de lʼenseignement; (e) des méthodes, des environnements dʼapprentissage, du matériel pédagogique ou des techniques dʼéva- luation innovants. 1.2.

Description Le programme «Éducation et formation 2010» comprend plusieurs mesures et initiatives visant à réaliser les trois grands objectifs convenus par le Conseil européen de Stockholm, en 2001, pour améliorer les systèmes européens dʼéducation et de formation: • améliorer la qualité et lʼefficacité des systèmes européens dʼéducation et de formation; • faciliter lʼaccès de tous aux systèmes dʼéducation et de formation; • ouvrir les systèmes dʼéducation et de formation sur le monde. Ces objectifs contribuent à leur tour à la réalisation des objectifs européens élargis de la stratégie de Lisbonne sur la croissance économique durable grâce à des emplois plus nombreux et de meilleure qualité et une plus CATALOGUE 2010/11 371 
grande cohésion sociale, adoptée en 2000. Malgré plusieurs évolutions positives en matière dʼéducation et de formation dans les États membres, la plupart des critères de référence adoptés par le Conseil pour 2010 ne seront pas atteints. En conséquence, le Conseil européen du printemps 2008 a encouragé les États membres à prendre des actions pour réduire substantiellement le nombre de jeunes en rupture scolaire et ne maîtrisant pas bien la lecture. Il a également été demandé aux États membres de prendre des actions pour attirer davan- tage dʼadultes, notamment parmi les personnes peu qualifiées et les travailleurs âgés, vers les structures dʼédu- cation et de formation, pour améliorer les niveaux dʼétudes des apprenants issus de lʼimmigration ou de groupes défavorisés et pour faciliter la mobilité géographique et la mobilité professionnelle. Lʼéquité, la qualité et lʼeffi- cacité des systèmes dʼéducation et de formation, ainsi que lʼaccès à ces systèmes, devaient donc être amé- liorés. Améliorer la qualité et lʼefficacité de lʼéducation et de la formation demeure un objectif stratégique pour la coo- pération européenne dans le domaine de lʼéducation et de la formation après 2010. Les conclusions du Conseil relatives au cadre stratégique pour cette coopération (Conseil de lʼUnion européenne, 2009) soulignent lʼim- portance dʼaméliorer la gouvernance et lʼencadrement des établissements dʼenseignement et des organismes de formation et dʼélaborer des systèmes efficaces dʼassurance de la qualité ( 2 ). LʼAnnée européenne de lutte contre la pauvreté et lʼexclusion sociale 2010 aura pour objet dʼattirer davan- tage lʼattention sur lʼexclusion sociale et dʼencourager une insertion active. Lʼune des activités prioritaires sera dʼéradiquer les inégalités en matière dʼéducation et de formation, en veillant en particulier à répondre aux be- soins des personnes souffrant de handicaps, des immigrés, des minorités ethniques et autres groupes ou in- dividus en situation de vulnérabilité et en prenant en considération les dimensions de lʼégalité hommes/femmes et de lʼâge (Commission européenne, 2008) ( 3 ). Lʼaccès, lʼéquité, la qualité et lʼefficacité englobent les éléments suivants: Accès à lʼéducation et la formation : lʼaccès à un enseignement préprimaire est essentiel pour un bon départ dans la vie, car il favorise la sociabilité des enfants et facilite lʼapprentissage ultérieur. Il est particulièrement im- portant pour les enfants de familles aux revenus modestes, de minorités ethniques et de migrants. Les États membres ont introduit des formes alternatives (plus flexibles) dʼéducation et de formation, des pro- grammes de la seconde chance, des dispositifs pour informer les parents sur les absences et ont réduit les coûts en fournissant du matériel scolaire gratuit et en assurant la gratuité du transport. Il importe dʼassurer une étroite coopération entre les secteurs de lʼenseignement général et de lʼenseignement professionnel et les écoles de la seconde chance pour les adultes. Pour les enfants présentant des besoins particuliers, lʼaccès est de plus en plus considéré comme le fait dʼavoir la possibilité de bénéficier dʼun enseignement général ou spécialisé, selon que lʼun ou lʼautre offre les meilleures possibilités dʼapprentissage pour un enfant donné. Au niveau de lʼenseignement supérieur, la gratuité de lʼéducation est déterminante, étant donné que les droits dʼinscription peuvent limiter lʼaccès. Les États membres devraient développer différentes passerelles dans lʼenseignement et la formation pro- fessionnels (EFP) vers lʼenseignement ultérieur et lʼemploi. Ils devraient également améliorer les programmes de formation publics pour les chômeurs et pour les apprenants issus de milieux défavorisés. La qualité et la per- tinence de ces programmes peuvent être améliorées en encourageant les partenariats avec les parties prenantes aux niveaux régional et local et en promouvant lʼimplication du secteur privé. Lʼéducation des adultes peut jouer un rôle clé en apportant une réponse à lʼexclusion sociale. Les États mem- bres devraient mettre en œuvre des systèmes efficaces dʼéducation des adultes qui fournissent aux adultes des 372 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 2 ) Conseil de lʼUnion européenne (2009).

compétences clés et augmentent leurs possibilités dʼaccéder au marché du travail. Lʼéducation et la formation peuvent contribuer à surmonter les désavantages socio-économiques mais elles peuvent aussi les perpétuer. Équité : lʼégalité des chances de réussite devrait être garantie pour tous les étudiants; la réussite ne devrait pas dépendre de circonstances indépendantes de la volonté de lʼélève ou de lʼétudiant, telles que la situation finan- cière de la famille, lʼéducation des parents ou leur situation professionnelle, la localisation géographique, lʼiden- tité ethnique et raciale, le genre et le handicap. En ce qui concerne la scolarité obligatoire, une attention parti- culière a été apportée à la possibilité dʼoffrir aux élèves ayant quitté prématurément lʼécole une «seconde chance» dʼapprendre. La formation professionnelle initiale joue un rôle important pour leur intégration dans la société en leur apportant les compétences, les connaissances et les qualifications nécessaires. La plupart des États membres devraient prendre encore davantage dʼinitiatives pour réduire le nombre des jeunes quittant lʼécole prématurément et pour lutter contre lʼinégalité découlant des désavantages socio-économiques. Qualité : il est essentiel de garantir des normes élevées de qualité à tous les niveaux de lʼenseignement et de la formation. Le renforcement de la qualité implique dʼaccroître les capacités des enseignants, directeurs dʼéta- blissement, formateurs et responsables de formation et des politiques à établir des liens avec les parents, mo- derniser les programmes et élargir les activités périscolaires, améliorer les infrastructures et instaurer un en- vironnement basé sur le respect. Les mécanismes dʼassurance qualité sont importants à tous les niveaux de lʼenseignement, y compris lʼévaluation des compétences des élèves, les autoévaluations des établissements, les évaluations externes et internes, la transparence et la validation des résultats. Il devient par exemple de plus en plus courant dʼimpliquer les partenaires sociaux et les acteurs du marché du travail («communautés dʼap- prentissage») dans les évaluations et la validation des résultats. Efficacité : les mesures clés visant à améliorer lʼefficacité institutionnelle et lʼadaptabilité aux exigences de for- mation et aux besoins du marché du travail en pleine mutation sont les suivantes: décentralisation (y compris les réformes visant à créer de lʼespace pour les initiatives éducatives des institutions); déréglementation; suivi des progrès au moyen dʼindicateurs de lʼefficacité éducative; recensement des pénuries de compétences et an- ticipation des besoins de compétences. Il est également essentiel de renforcer la culture de lʼévaluation dans les systèmes dʼenseignement et de formation afin de rechercher comment utiliser (plus) efficacement les res- sources (investissements des secteurs public et privé). Les visites dʼétude présenteront les évolutions et les mesures relatives aux éléments suivants: (a) développement et mise en œuvre de mesures destinées à améliorer lʼaccès des groupes défavorisés à lʼen- seignement et à la formation; (b) élaboration et réalisation dʼactivités favorisant lʼéquité; (c) élaboration et mise en œuvre de mesures visant à accroître la qualité de lʼoffre dʼéducation et de forma- tion; (d) évaluation et analyse de lʼefficacité des systèmes dʼenseignement et de formation. 2.2.

Maintenir l’attrait des métiers d’enseignant et de formateur et améliorer la direction des établissements 3.1. Description Relever la qualité de lʼenseignement et de la formation dans les États membres était un objectif important du programme de travail «Éducation et formation 2010». Le cadre stratégique pour la coopération européenne dans le domaine de lʼéducation et de la formation (Conseil de lʼUnion européenne, 2009) ( 4 ) après 2010 réaffirme la nécessité de dispenser un enseignement de grande qualité et, à cet égard, de proposer aux enseignants une formation initiale adéquate et un développement professionnel continu et de faire de la profession dʼenseignant un choix de carrière intéressant. 374 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 4 ) Conseil de lʼUnion européenne (2009).

Les enseignants et les formateurs doivent de plus en plus développer de nouvelles compétences pour faire face aux défis associés à lʼautonomie grandissante des établissements dʼenseignement et de formation, et des étudiants. De nouvelles compétences sont exigées de la part des enseignants et formateurs, notamment lʼuti- lisation des nouvelles technologies et lʼattention pour les besoins dʼapprentissage individuels. Or la formation en cours dʼemploi pour les enseignants nʼest obligatoire que dans 11 États membres. Les défis croissants auxquels sont confrontés les enseignants sont également dus au stress, et aux com- portements agressifs dans la salle de classe, comme cela est mentionné dans le document de travail des ser- vices de la Commission «Quelle école pour le 21 e siècle?»; tous ces facteurs ont un impact négatif sur les per- formances et la satisfaction au travail et peuvent inciter les enseignants à arrêter prématurément dʼexercer leur profession. De nombreux enseignants âgés devraient prendre leur retraite bientôt, ce qui signifie que la profession dʼen- seignant et lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie doivent être rendus encore plus attrayants, et quʼil faut veil- ler à recruter de nouveaux enseignants tout en retenant ceux actuellement en poste. Si cette situation met les États membres face à une difficulté (remplacer lʼexpérience perdue), elle leur offre aussi lʼopportunité dʼinves- tir dans la formation initiale des nouveaux enseignants et dans la consolidation des compétences des ensei- gnants déjà en poste. Pour rehausser le niveau de qualité de lʼenseignement dans son ensemble, il est également indispensable dʼaméliorer la qualité de la direction des écoles et de promouvoir la coopération entre les responsables en ma- tière dʼéducation. En 2007, le Conseil européen a mis lʼaccent sur lʼimportance de lʼaccès des directions dʼécole et responsables dʼétablissement à une formation de qualité élevée. Il est également souhaitable que les res- ponsables en matière dʼéducation puissent travailler ensemble pour relever des défis communs posés aux sys- tèmes éducatifs européens. La coopération européenne est régie par un processus volontaire connu en tant que méthode ouverte de coor- dination. Depuis 2004, des principes communs pour les compétences et les qualifications des enseignants ont été convenus au niveau européen, en attirant lʼattention des responsables politiques sur lʼimportance dʼune main- dʼœuvre hautement qualifiée, du développement professionnel continu, de la mobilité des enseignants et des partenariats entre les écoles et les autres institutions. En 2007, le Conseil des ministres a rappelé la nécessité dʼaméliorer la qualité de la formation des enseignants, de les doter de compétences de direction, et de fournir des moyens qui rendent la profession dʼenseignant plus attrayante. Parmi les acteurs concernés par ces dé- veloppements figurent les institutions responsables de la formation et du recrutement des enseignants, les di- recteurs dʼécole et les prestataires de services éducatifs, les organismes responsables de lʼhabilitation, lʼins- pection et la qualité des enseignants, les partenaires sociaux (syndicats), ainsi que les responsables politiques locaux et nationaux. Les visites dʼétude présenteront les développements et les mesures destinées à rendre la profession dʼen- seignant et la formation plus attrayantes, en mettant lʼaccent sur la direction et la qualité, grâce aux aspects suivants: (a) élaboration de programmes visant à recruter et retenir des personnels hautement qualifiés dans toutes les professions de lʼenseignement et de la formation; (b) renforcement de la qualité et des compétences des responsables des prestataires dʼenseignement et de formation; (c) développement professionnel continu des enseignants et formateurs; (d) initiatives favorisant la mobilité des enseignants et des formateurs. 3.2.

Description La crise économique qui frappe actuellement lʼEurope exige des mesures immédiates et efficaces pour stimu- ler le développement économique et social à long terme, renforcer la compétitivité et la cohésion sociale et sou- tenir lʼemployabilité. La Commission européenne, dans sa communication au Conseil européen de printemps intitulée «LʼEurope, moteur de la relance» (Commission européenne, 2009) ( 5 ), énonce plusieurs éléments qui devraient aider les États membres à élaborer et à mettre en œuvre des politiques de lʼemploi appropriées et efficaces. À cet égard, elle a défini trois priorités essentielles : préserver les emplois existants, en créer de nouveaux et encourager la mobilité; mettre à niveau les compétences et assurer leur cohérence avec les be- soins du marché du travail; faciliter lʼaccès à lʼemploi. Un grand nombre de jeunes sont exclus du marché du travail en raison de leur faible niveau dʼétudes et de lʼinsuffisance de leurs compétences. Les restructurations économiques et lʼévolution des besoins de compé- tences représentent des risques pour la sécurité de lʼemploi. Les travailleurs doivent avoir la possibilité dʼac- tualiser leurs connaissances, qualifications et compétences et dʼen développer de nouvelles à différents stades de leur vie. Cʼest particulièrement important pour les personnes en situation dʼemploi précaire, celles sans em- ploi ou sur le point de perdre leur emploi, les travailleurs âgés, les personnes faiblement qualifiées, les personnes issues de lʼimmigration ou les personnes handicapées. 376 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 5 ) Commission européenne (2009). LʼEurope, moteur de la relance. Communication au Conseil européen de printemps, volume 1. Bruxelles, 4.3.2009, COM(2009) 114 final: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0114:FIN:FR:PDF 
Bien que lʼEurope nʼait pas encore réalisé ses objectifs en matière dʼemploi et que les tendances économiques ne soient pas particulièrement favorables, certains pays sont déjà confrontés à des pénuries de compétences. Dans un proche avenir, lʼEurope devra peut-être faire face à un problème majeur de compétences. Compte tenu de lʼaugmentation de la durée de vie et de la baisse du taux de natalité, le nombre de jeunes arrivant sur le mar- ché de lʼemploi va en diminuant tandis que la durée dʼactivité professionnelle sʼallonge. En 2020, 50 % de tous les emplois devraient exiger un niveau moyen de qualification, environ 31,5 % des emplois devraient exiger un niveau élevé, alors que la demande en main-dʼœuvre faiblement qualifiée devrait passer de 1/3 en 1996 à en- viron 18,5 %. Les compétences de nombreux emplois actuels évolueront et nécessiteront que les personnes réactualisent leurs connaissances en permanence; dans dʼautres cas, les personnes devront sʼadapter à de nou- veaux emplois. Lʼéducation et la formation initiales fournissent des compétences de base sur lesquelles pourront sʼappuyer des apprentissages ultérieurs. Les connaissances et les compétences que les personnes acquièrent peuvent les aider à entrer sur le marché du travail et aussi à sʼadapter à de nouvelles exigences, de nouvelles méthodes de travail et des emplois qui sont encore inconnus. Une étroite coopération avec les entreprises peut permettre dʼaméliorer la pertinence de lʼenseignement et de la formation vis-à-vis du monde du travail. Lʼapprentissage sur le lieu de travail peut encourager les appre- nants – qui, sans ce dispositif, auraient quitté lʼécole prématurément – à poursuivre leur éducation et forma- tion. Dans le contexte du marché du travail mondialisé et plus mobile, les travailleurs ont également besoin de compétences linguistiques et culturelles pour réussir. Faute de compétences linguistiques professionnelles suf- fisantes, par exemple, les migrants auront du mal à trouver un emploi (approprié) ou les petites et moyennes entreprises auront des difficultés à réussir au niveau international. Pour choisir des programmes dʼenseignement et de formation et des emplois adéquats, il faut, entre autres conditions préalables indispensables, disposer dʼinformations sur les compétences recherchées par les entre- prises et de conseils dʼorientation prenant en considération les compétences et les besoins de lʼindividu. Pour encourager les personnes à (re)faire un apprentissage et à économiser du temps et de lʼargent, il importe que les établissements dʼenseignement et de formation et les employeurs évaluent les connaissances, les qualifi- cations et les compétences que les personnes ont acquises au travail, dans le cadre dʼactivités bénévoles ou dans le contexte familial. Le développement des compétences sʼinscrit également dans le cadre de la flexicurité. Lʼidée est dʼassurer que les personnes conservent leur emploi, ou trouvent facilement un emploi bien quʼelles soient éventuellement contraintes de changer dʼemploi ou dʼinterrompre leur carrière à un moment donné. Cette approche exige des stratégies globales dʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie qui couvrent tous les niveaux et tous les secteurs de lʼéducation et qui établissent un lien entre lʼéducation et la formation, lʼemploi et les politiques économiques et sociales. De telles stratégies ne sont pas encore en place dans tous les pays. Lʼaide à lʼemployabilité des personnes est au cœur de nombreuses initiatives conjointes entre la Commis- sion européenne et les pays, ainsi que les partenaires sociaux européens. Les principales initiatives dans ce domaine au niveau européen englobent les éléments suivants: Compétences clés pour lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie : le Conseil de lʼUnion européenne et le Par- lement européen recommandent aux États membres ( 6 ) de permettre aux apprenants dʼacquérir des compé- tences clés qui les aideront à sʼadapter à lʼévolution des demandes sur le marché du travail et à contribuer ac- tivement à la société. Enseignement et formation professionnels (EFP): signée en 2002 dans le sillage de la stratégie de Lisbonne et de la coopération en matière dʼéducation et de formation, la déclaration de Copenhague a été le point de CATALOGUE 2010/11 377 ( 6 ) Recommandation du Parlement européen et du Conseil sur les compétences clés pour lʼéducation et la formation tout au long de la vie (2006/962/CE): http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:394:0010:0018:FR:PDF 
départ dʼune coopération plus étroite entre la Commission, les États membres et les partenaires sociaux eu- ropéens en matière dʼEFP. LʼEFP joue un rôle clé en assurant lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie et en four- nissant ainsi une main-dʼœuvre qualifiée en adéquation avec le marché du travail. Le processus de Copenhague vise à faciliter lʼaccès à lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie et à promouvoir la mobilité éducative, profession- nelle et géographique. Il a entraîné dʼimportantes innovations qui ont eu directement ou indirectement pour ef- fet dʼaméliorer lʼemployabilité; au rang de ces innovations figurent les principes communs visant à accroître la transparence des qualifications, lʼassurance qualité dans lʼEFP, lʼorientation tout au long de la vie et la valida- tion des acquis non formels et informels. Le communiqué de Bordeaux des ministres européens chargés de lʼEFP de 2008 introduit un nouvel objec- tif qui est de renforcer les liens entre lʼEFP et le marché du travail, et relie cet objectif à lʼinitiative «Des com- pétences nouvelles pour des emplois nouveaux» visant à anticiper et faire coïncider les compétences requises et les besoins du marché du travail ( 7 ). Enseignement supérieur : le processus de Bologne vise à créer dʼici 2010 un espace européen de lʼensei- gnement supérieur, dans lequel les étudiants pourront choisir un cursus de qualité dans une offre vaste et trans- parente et bénéficier de lʼassouplissement des procédures de reconnaissance. Le processus de Bologne a proposé lʼadoption dʼun système principalement basé sur trois cycles (licence/bachelor-master-doctorat). La li- cence, obtenue à lʼissue du premier cycle, doit correspondre à un niveau de qualification approprié pour lʼin- sertion sur le marché du travail européen. Le deuxième cycle conduira au master et/ou à un doctorat, comme cʼest déjà le cas dans de nombreux pays européens. Pour relever le défi de lʼemployabilité, les liens entre lʼEFP et lʼenseignement supérieur deviennent de plus en plus importants dans le contexte de lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie. La possibilité dʼaccéder à lʼen- seignement supérieur est un important facteur de motivation pour inciter lʼapprenant à sʼengager dans lʼEFP. Les États membres ont entamé le rapprochement entre les systèmes dʼenseignement supérieur et dʼEFP. Éducation des adultes : les conclusions du Conseil sur lʼéducation des adultes (2008) soulignent quʼil est crucial, à la fois pour lʼemployabilité et pour lʼinsertion sociale, que les adultes continuent dʼapprendre à sʼadap- ter au changement: lʼamélioration permanente des compétences, lʼactualisation des compétences et le déve- loppement continu des capacités sont des conditions indispensables à la participation active au sein de la société. Les conclusions du Conseil sur les compétences nouvelles pour des emplois nouveaux (Conseil de lʼUnion européenne, 2009) soulignent quʼeu égard à la crise économique actuelle, à la concurrence mondiale, aux évo- lutions technologiques vers une économie à faibles émissions de CO 2 et au vieillissement démographique, il est vital que lʼEurope investisse dans les compétences, à tous les niveaux, et fournisse à tous ses citoyens un enseignement de qualité, non seulement pour son redressement à court terme mais aussi pour sa croissance et sa compétitivité à plus long terme, ainsi que pour lʼéquité et la cohésion sociale. Il importe dʼaider les États membres à anticiper les besoins futurs de compétences pour les travailleurs et les employeurs de lʼUE, en éla- borant des projections régulièrement mises à jour concernant les tendances du marché du travail à lʼéchelon local, régional, national et européen et à analyser les compétences requises par secteur ( 8 ). 378 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 7 ) Communiqué de Bordeaux sur la coopération renforcée en matière dʼenseignement et de formation professionnels.

La flexicurité établit un compromis entre la flexibilité et la sécurité sur le marché du travail et aide à la fois les employés et les employeurs à saisir les opportunités quʼoffre la mondialisation. Les principes communs de la flexicurité sont les suivants: stratégies globales dʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie; politiques actives effi- caces sur le marché du travail; facilitation de la mobilité ascensionnelle et de la mobilité entre les situations de chômage ou dʼinactivité et de travail; actualisation permanente des compétences. Les partenaires sociaux européens ont développé leur propre cadre dʼactions pour le développement des com- pétences dʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie et les qualifications, mais participent aux efforts de la Commis- sion et des pays visant à améliorer lʼEFP en Europe et à la rendre plus attractive. Les visites dʼétude présenteront les développements et les mesures relatives à lʼéducation et lʼenseignement pour lʼemployabilité: (a) contribution de lʼéducation et de la formation en vue dʼaméliorer les connaissances, les qualifications et les compétences pour le marché du travail; (b) analyse des déficits et des besoins de compétences émergents sur les marchés du travail des États mem- bres de lʼUE et élaboration de politiques visant à traiter ce problème; (c) conception et mise en œuvre dʼactivités (transition de lʼenseignement et de la formation à la vie active, orien- tation professionnelle et apprentissage sur le lieu de travail, etc.) en vue dʼaccroître lʼemployabilité. 4.2. Liste de thèmes pour les visites dʼétude • Transition de lʼenseignement et de la formation à la vie active • Apprentissage sur le lieu de travail • Intégration des groupes défavorisés sur le marché du travail • Renforcement de lʼattrait de lʼEFP • Contribution des partenaires sociaux à lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie • Compétences nouvelles pour des emplois nouveaux 4.3.

5. Mise en œuvre d’outils, de principes et de cadres européens communs pour l’apprentissage tout au long de la vie, y inclus l'orientation tout au long de la vie 5.1. Description Plusieurs outils, principes et cadres communs ont été ou sont développés au niveau européen en vue dʼatteindre les objectifs de Lisbonne ( 9 ) en termes de promotion de la mobilité des citoyens européens ainsi que de leurs qua- lifications et acquis dʼapprentissage. Ils visent tous à renforcer la coopération européenne et à améliorer la trans- parence, la reconnaissance et lʼassurance de la qualité dans tous les secteurs de lʼéducation et la formation. Le cadre européen des certifications (CEC) est un cadre de référence commun, qui permet aux pays euro- péens dʼétablir un lien entre leurs systèmes de certification et de faciliter la lecture et la compréhension des cer- tifications dans différents pays et systèmes européens. Il a deux objectifs principaux: promouvoir la mobilité des citoyens entre les pays et lʼéducation et la formation tout au long de la vie. De plus en plus de pays européens mettent en place et appliquent des cadres nationaux des certifications qui sont étroitement liés – mais pas ex- clusivement toutefois – au CEC. Les gouvernements sont intéressés par la mise en place de cadres globaux permettant dʼenglober des qua- lifications qui correspondent à des acquis dʼapprentissage dans différents domaines, par exemple le milieu sco- laire, le milieu professionnel, lʼenseignement supérieur et lʼéducation des adultes. Ces nouveaux cadres sont souvent liés aux stratégies dʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie et destinés à sʼouvrir à lʼapprentissage infor- mel, ou à lʼexpérience, que les apprenants souhaitent voir reconnus. Des principes européens communs pour la validation des acquis non formels et informels ont été énoncés en 2004, puis transformés en 2009 en lignes directrices, afin de mettre en place un instrument pour lʼélaboration et la mise en œuvre de méthodes et de sys- tèmes de validation dans les États membres ( 10 ). Le cadre européen des certifications sert également de référence européenne commune aux organisations internationales qui souhaitent mettre en place leurs propres certifications à travers les pays. Il peut également contribuer à concilier la demande de compétences à long terme du marché du travail et les politiques relatives à lʼéducation et la formation afin de sʼadapter aux changements et aux restructurations engendrés par la mon- dialisation. La plupart des pays ont dʼores et déjà entrepris dʼélaborer des cadres nationaux génériques de cer- tifications, englobant tous les sous-systèmes. Un cadre national des certifications est un outil qui permet dʼas- surer une meilleure cohérence en matière de développement des politiques et dʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie et qui vise à faciliter lʼaccès, la progression et la reconnaissance des acquis. LʼEuropass ( 11 ) est un outil permettant aux citoyens de faire comprendre clairement et facilement leurs connais- sances, leurs compétences et leurs qualifications et favorisant la mobilité en Europe. Il comprend cinq docu- ments: le curriculum vitae, le passeport de langues, lʼEuropass mobilité, le supplément descriptif du certificat et le supplément au diplôme. La transparence des qualifications et la reconnaissance des acquis dʼapprentissage sont également soute- nues par des outils qui aident les apprenants à transférer les crédits obtenus au cours de périodes dʼappren- tissage dans leur propre pays ou à lʼétranger. Il sʼagit du système européen de transfert et dʼaccumulation de crédits (ECTS) pour lʼenseignement supérieur et, pour lʼEFP, du système européen de crédits dʼappren- tissage pour la formation et lʼenseignement professionnels (ECVET) . LʼECVET a été formellement établi par une recommandation adoptée en 2009 par le Parlement européen et le Conseil ( 12 ).

En 2009, le Parlement européen et le Conseil ont par ailleurs adopté une recommandation établissant un cadre européen de référence pour lʼassurance qualité dans lʼEFP ( 13 ), tandis que des normes communes ont déjà été élaborées pour lʼenseignement supérieur. Cette recommandation définit également des critères de qua- lité et des descripteurs indicatifs, ainsi quʼun ensemble de référence dʼindicateurs de qualité pour lʼEFP. Des services dʼorientation et de conseil de grande qualité aident les citoyens à apprendre tout au long de leur vie, à gérer leur carrière et à réaliser leurs objectifs personnels. Lʼorientation tout au long de la vie sʼinscrit dans le cadre dʼobjectifs plus larges de plein emploi, dʼélévation des niveaux dʼéducation et de croissance éco- nomique. En 2008, le Conseil de lʼUnion européenne a adopté une résolution pour une meilleure inclusion de lʼorientation dans les stratégies dʼéducation et de formation tout au long de la vie ( 14 ) qui renforce le rôle de lʼorien- tation tout au long de la vie dans le développement et la mise en œuvre des politiques européennes dʼéduca- tion, de formation et dʼemploi. Les visites dʼétude présenteront les outils, les principes et les cadres européens en faveur de lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie, et notamment: (a) lʼélaboration et la mise en œuvre des cadres des certifications en référence au CEC; (b) la promotion de lʼEuropass et son utilisation par les établissements dʼenseignement et de formation, les ser- vices dʼorientation et de lʼemploi ainsi que par les citoyens; (c) la conception et la mise en œuvre de cadres dʼassurance de la qualité inspirés du cadre européen de ré- férence pour lʼassurance de la qualité; (d) des outils pour le transfert de crédits visant à promouvoir la mobilité des apprenants; (e) les principes de reconnaissance des apprentissages non formels et informels; (f) la promotion dʼune action politique pour lʼorientation tout au long de la vie en vue de développer les struc- tures dʼorientation au niveau national/régional. 5.2.

6. Tendances et défis dans les stratégies d’apprentissage tout au long de la vie 6.1. Description La crise économique qui frappe actuellement lʼEurope met en évidence combien lʼéducation et la formation sont des leviers importants pour la relance européenne. La flexibilité et la sécurité nécessaires pour des emplois plus nombreux et de meilleure qualité dépendent de la capacité à garantir que tous les citoyens acquièrent des com- pétences clés et mettent à jour leurs qualifications tout au long de leur vie. Lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie soutient la créativité et lʼinnovation et permet une participation économique et sociale à part entière. Cʼest la raison pour laquelle les États membres de lʼUE et la Commission européenne ont considérablement renforcé au cours de ces dernières années leur coopération politique dans le cadre notamment du programme de tra- vail «Éducation et formation 2010», visant à atteindre les objectifs de Lisbonne et à promouvoir lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie. Le programme pour lʼéducation et la formation tout au long de la vie 2007-2013 reprend des actions préalablement menées dans le domaine de lʼéducation et la formation sur le plan européen, no- tamment dans lʼEFP dans le cadre du processus de Copenhague, et les liens avec le processus de Bologne qui est fondamental pour lʼétablissement dʼun espace européen de lʼenseignement supérieur. Le programme de travail «Éducation et formation 2010» applique la méthode ouverte de coordination en tant que cadre stratégique de coopération entre la Commission et les États membres. Cette méthode permet de dif- fuser des bonnes pratiques et de parvenir à une plus grande convergence vers les principaux objectifs com- munautaires: • en identifiant et en définissant conjointement les objectifs à atteindre; • en définissant en commun les critères de référence et les indicateurs permettant aux États membres de sa- voir où ils se situent et dʼévaluer les progrès réalisés dans la réalisation des objectifs fixés; • en indiquant les moyens de favoriser les échanges et la diffusion des bonnes pratiques, notamment avec des activités dʼapprentissage entre pairs. La Commission européenne, en concertation avec les États membres, a récemment réexaminé la coopéra- tion européenne dans le domaine de lʼéducation et de la formation et défini des priorités stratégiques pour cette coopération jusquʼen 2020: • faire en sorte que lʼéducation et la formation tout au long de la vie et la mobilité deviennent une réalité; • améliorer la qualité et lʼefficacité de lʼéducation et de la formation; • faciliter lʼéquité, la cohésion sociale et la citoyenneté active; • encourager la créativité et lʼinnovation, y compris lʼesprit dʼentreprise, à tous les niveaux de lʼéducation et de la formation. Cette coopération devrait porter sur lʼapprentissage dans tous les contextes – quʼil soit formel, non formel ou informel – et à tous les niveaux: de lʼenseignement préscolaire et scolaire jusquʼà lʼenseignement supérieur, lʼEFP et lʼéducation et la formation des adultes (Conseil de lʼUnion européenne, 2009) ( 15 ). Les échanges dʼinformations sur les différentes options politiques peuvent contribuer à faire progresser les réformes des systèmes nationaux dʼéducation et de formation et, avec dʼautres activités dʼapprentissage com- munes, à avancer vers les objectifs et les références communs pour lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie. La plupart des pays ont progressé dans la définition de stratégies unifiées et globales dʼéducation et de for- mation tout au long de la vie. Dans ces cadres, les avancées sont évidentes dans lʼenseignement préscolaire, la validation des acquis non formels et informels et tout particulièrement les cadres nationaux des certifications qui ont été mis en place dans la plupart des États membres de lʼUE en réponse au cadre européen des certi- fications basé sur les acquis dʼapprentissage. 384 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 15 ) Conseil de lʼUnion européenne (2009).

Malgré les progrès dans les domaines susmentionnés, les défis suivants restent à relever pour mettre en œu- vre les stratégies dʼéducation et de formation tout au long de la vie. Il convient dʼappliquer des stratégies dʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie cohérentes et exhaustives inté- grant lʼéducation, lʼenseignement supérieur, lʼéducation des adultes et lʼEFP. Il est essentiel dʼadopter une ap- proche intégrée mettant en relation lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie et lʼEFP avec dʼautres domaines po- litiques tels que la macroéconomie, lʼemploi, la concurrence, lʼentreprise, la recherche et lʼinnovation ainsi que les politiques sociales. Lʼun des principaux défis des cadres nationaux des certifications sera leur capacité à se positionner comme des instruments dʼintégration, permettant dʼétablir des passerelles entre les secteurs de lʼéducation et la for- mation et dʼexploiter les acquis de lʼapprentissage non formel et informel, y compris sur le lieu de travail. La participation des adultes à lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie est encore loin des objectifs européens. Des efforts supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour mettre à jour leurs compétences à différents stades de leur vie, étendre leur accès à lʼéducation et la formation et la valorisation de leurs apprentissages, améliorer la qua- lité des prestations et accroître la flexibilité et la sécurité sur le marché du travail. De faibles niveaux dʼétudes et des compétences insuffisantes sont les principaux facteurs expliquant lʼex- clusion sociale et la situation peu satisfaisante sur le marché du travail. Ce constat sʼapplique notamment aux travailleurs âgés, aux travailleurs peu qualifiés et autres groupes défavorisés (tels que les migrants) qui risquent de perdre leur emploi ou de ne pas en trouver. Les tendances démographiques et relatives au marché du tra- vail conduiront à une augmentation de la demande de main-dʼœuvre hautement qualifiée et à des opportuni- tés toujours plus minces pour les travailleurs faiblement qualifiés. Pour relever ce défi, il faudra accroître les investissements en termes de capital humain et social et améliorer la participation à lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie. Les visites dʼétude présenteront les évolutions concernant: (a) les réformes de lʼéducation et de la formation ainsi que les mesures politiques visant à mettre en œuvres les stratégies intégrées dʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie; (b) les mesures politiques permettant dʼaccroître la participation des adultes à lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie; (c) la mise en œuvre de filières dʼapprentissage souples et de possibilités de transition entre différentes par- ties des systèmes nationaux. 6.2.

Mise en place de communautés d’apprentissage associant tous les acteurs de l’éducation et de la formation 7.1. Description Lʼéducation et la formation européennes jouent plusieurs rôles importants au sein de notre société. Elles four- nissent aux apprenants les connaissances, qualifications et compétences dont ils ont besoin pour exercer un emploi ou une profession, mais elles contribuent également au développement de compétences importantes pour la vie familiale et sociale de chacun. Ouvrir au monde extérieur les systèmes dʼéducation et de formation est lʼun des trois objectifs stratégiques du programme de travail adopté par les ministres de lʼéducation européens afin de faire de lʼEurope une so- ciété fondée sur la connaissance (stratégie de Lisbonne). Dans sa communication intitulée «Améliorer les com- pétences pour le XXI e siècle: un programme de coopération européenne en matière scolaire», la Commission européenne souligne lʼimportance des «communautés dʼapprentissage» qui englobent les partenariats avec des agences, des organisations et dʼautres acteurs extérieurs à lʼenvironnement scolaire «classique». Les établissements dʼenseignement et de formation deviennent ainsi davantage responsables vis-à-vis des partenaires et les représentants du marché du travail, les familles, les organisations civiques et environnemen- tales ainsi que les apprenants peuvent travailler ensemble pour déterminer les résultats escomptés de lʼappren- tissage, le contenu et les formes dʼapprentissage adaptées. La participation des parents est également primor- diale car elle contribue à la réussite scolaire et à lʼamélioration de lʼécole. Les établissements dʼenseignement et de formation peuvent également favoriser la prévention et la lutte contre toutes les formes de violence à lʼen- contre des enfants et des jeunes et contribuer à instaurer un niveau élevé de protection de la santé, de bien- être et de cohésion sociale. Le cadre stratégique actualisé pour la coopération européenne dans le domaine de lʼéducation et de la for- mation après 2010 (Conseil de lʼUnion européenne, 2009) ( 16 ) souligne lʼimportance de développer des parte- 386 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS 
nariats entre les prestataires dʼenseignement et de formation et les partenaires sociaux ( 17 ), les entreprises, les instituts de recherche, les acteurs culturels et les industries créatives pour doter les individus des compétences et qualifications requises sur le marché du travail et pour encourager lʼinnovation. Les visites dʼétude présenteront des approches et des exemples de bonnes pratiques concernant: (a) les incitations et les initiatives mises en place sur le plan national et régional en faveur de la coopération entre les établissements dʼenseignement et de formation et les partenaires extérieurs, dont les parents, les municipalités, les entreprises, les partenaires sociaux, les ONG, etc.; (b) des exemples nationaux, régionaux et locaux de gouvernance participative et dʼévaluation des établisse- ments dʼenseignement et de formation; (c) les initiatives en matière de prévention de la violence à lʼencontre des enfants et des jeunes. 7.2.

Description Faire en sorte que lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie et la mobilité deviennent une réalité est lʼun des ob- jectifs stratégiques pour la coopération européenne dans le domaine de lʼéducation et de la formation après 2010 (Conseil de lʼUnion européenne, 2009) ( 18 ). La construction dʼun véritable espace européen de lʼenseignement constitue une priorité pour lʼUnion euro- péenne, tant pour des raisons culturelles quʼéconomiques. La mobilité des citoyens, notamment dans le cadre de lʼéducation et la formation, contribue à promouvoir le sentiment dʼappartenance à lʼEurope en renforçant la conscience européenne et lʼémergence dʼune citoyenneté européenne. Dʼun point de vue plus pratique, elle per- met aux jeunes dʼaméliorer leurs compétences personnelles et leur capacité dʼinsertion professionnelle et aux enseignants et formateurs dʼélargir le champ de leurs expériences et dʼaméliorer leurs compétences. Enfin, dans une économie internationalisée, la capacité à se former et à travailler dans un environnement plurilingue est essentielle à la compétitivité de lʼéconomie européenne. La charte européenne de qualité pour la mobilité de 2006 est le document de référence en matière de qua- lité pour les séjours à lʼétranger dʼéducation et de formation. Elle complète la recommandation de 2001 en fa- veur de la mobilité des étudiants, des personnes en formation, des jeunes volontaires, des enseignants et des formateurs. Cette charte, qui a été adoptée par les États membres, dégage des orientations concernant les mo- dalités de la mobilité à des fins dʼapprentissage ou à dʼautres fins, comme lʼévolution professionnelle, des jeunes et des adultes. La Commission européenne a lancé en 2007 le nouveau programme dʼéducation et de formation tout au long de la vie . Il a remplacé les anciens programmes en matière dʼéducation, formation professionnelle et e- learning qui se sont achevés en 2006 permettant aux programmes Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci et Grundtvig de se poursuivre. Ce programme soutient les échanges et les relations entre personnes, établissements et pays. Par exem- ple, les échanges dʼétudiants, les formations en cours dʼemploi dans les écoles ou lʼéducation des adultes et la participation à de courts stages spécifiques pour les étudiants de lʼenseignement professionnel dans des en- treprises dʼun autre pays concernent les personnes. Les échanges entre établissements impliquent la mise en place de partenariats entre écoles de différents pays ainsi que des projets conjoints menés par des universi- tés afin dʼélaborer des cursus communs et des programmes intensifs de courte durée ou de constituer des ré- seaux thématiques dans différentes disciplines. Les relations entre pays comprennent les visites dʼétude pour 388 CEDEFOP – STUDY VISITS ( 18 ) Conseil de lʼUnion européenne (2009).

les administrateurs régionaux et nationaux en matière dʼéducation, de formation et dʼorientation, les réseaux dʼexperts nationaux ou la publication de statistiques comparables sur les systèmes dʼéducation et de forma- tion. Un forum dʼexperts de haut niveau sur la mobilité a été mis en place par la Commission européenne et en juillet 2008, il a préconisé dʼaccroître radicalement les possibilités de mobilité des jeunes à moyen terme. Dʼici 2020, au moins 50 % des jeunes devraient pouvoir bénéficier dʼune forme de mobilité transfrontalière au cours de leurs études ou de leur formation, sous la forme dʼun stage ou dans le cadre dʼactivités de volontariat. Cette offre devrait sʼappliquer quelle que soit la catégorie sociale des personnes et couvrir une vaste gamme de contextes dʼapprentissage, dont lʼécole, lʼuniversité et la formation professionnelle ainsi que dʼautres environnements dʼap- prentissages informels. Le forum a appelé à une action stratégique afin de supprimer les obstacles à la mobi- lité et de garantir la qualité et lʼéchange de bonnes pratiques. En juillet 2009, la Commission européenne a lancé une consultation publique sur le Livre vert «Promouvoir la mobilité des jeunes à des fins dʼapprentissage» ( 19 ). Ce livre vert traite des divers aspects dʼune période de mobilité, de sa préparation à son prolongement, ainsi que des principaux obstacles à la mobilité, et invite à for- muler des propositions et à présenter des exemples de bonnes pratiques en vue dʼéliminer ces obstacles. Outre les initiatives ci-dessus, des outils communs sont conçus pour la transparence des qualifications et une mobilité accrue entre les différents pays et systèmes en Europe. Il sʼagit du cadre européen des certifications pour lʼapprentissage tout au long de la vie (CEC), du système européen de crédits dʼapprentissage pour la for- mation et lʼenseignement professionnels (ECVET), du système européen de transfert et dʼaccumulation de cré- dits (ECTS) et de lʼEuropass. Les visites dʼétude présenteront les évolutions et les mesures concernant la mise en place de la mobilité dans lʼéducation et la formation tout au long de la vie, telles que: (a) les initiatives et les projets relatifs à la mobilité des apprenants dans différents contextes dʼapprentissage; (b) les initiatives et les projets promouvant un meilleur accès de tous les individus à la mobilité; (c) les initiatives permettant que les qualifications soient plus claires et compréhensibles à travers les différents pays et systèmes dʼEurope; (d) les nouvelles approches visant à simplifier la validation et la reconnaissance des savoirs, aptitudes et com- pétences acquis au cours de la période de mobilité; (e) la promotion de lʼEuropass et son utilisation par les établissements dʼenseignement et de formation, les ser- vices de lʼemploi et les citoyens; (f) les outils pour le transfert et la reconnaissance des acquis dʼapprentissage en vue de faciliter la mobilité des apprenants. 8.2.

Women’s opportunities for progression and higher pay in the workplace are affected by their family responsibilities. The gender pay gap widens when women have children and when they work part-time. The employment rate for women with dependent children is only 62.4% compared with 91.4 % for men with children. More than three-quarters of part-time workers are women (76.5 %). Women and men still tend to work in different jobs. Women often work in sectors where wages are, on average, lower than those dominated by men. The gender pay gap exists even though women represent as many as 59 % of all university graduates. Women’s skills and competences are under- valued especially in those occupations where women predominate. What is the gender pay gap?   On average, women in the EU earn around 17.4 % less than men   The gender pay gap is the difference between men’s and women’s pay (based on hourly earnings across the economy)   In some countries the gender pay gap is widening   The gender pay gap is a complex issue with multiples causes often interrelated   The effect of the gender pay gap on lifetime earnings means that women have lower pensions and have a higher risk of poverty Stereotypes shape women’s and men’s roles in society, starting at a very early age. Whilst this may reflect personal preferences, traditions and stereotypes may influence, for example, the choice of educational paths and employment patterns. The gender pay gap reduces lifetime earnings and women’s pensions. When women retire their lower pensions mean higher risk of poverty. Boy or girl, equal opportunities? Will having a child harm my career? Same job, same pension? Is our work valued the same? Close the gender pay gap It makes sense for everyone E N

M. whereas the demand for illegal wildlife products in destination markets promotes corruption across the wildlife trafficking supply chain; N. whereas the EU is a significant destination market and transit route for illegal wildlife trade but also a source of trafficking in certain European endangered species of flora and fauna; O. whereas the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution of April 2013, endorsed by the UN Economic and Social Council on 25 July 2013, encourages its ‘Member States to make illicit trafficking in protected species of wild fauna and flora involving organised criminal groups a serious crime’, thereby placing it on the same level as human trafficking and drug trafficking; General remarks 1. Welcomes the Commission’s Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking, which highlights the need for coordinated actions to address the causes of wildlife trafficking, to implement and enforce existing rules effectively, and to strengthen global cooperation between source, transit and destination countries; 2. Calls on the Commission, the Member States, the European External Action Service and the EU agencies Europol and Eurojust to recognise that wildlife crime is a serious and growing threat and to address it with the greatest political urgency; highlights the need for comprehensive and coordinated approaches across policy areas including trade, development, foreign affairs, transport and tourism, and justice and home affairs; 3. Stresses that the identification and allocation of appropriate financial and human resources is essential for the implementation of the Action Plan; underlines the need to provide adequate financial resources in the EU budget and the national budgets in order to ensure effective implementation of this plan; 4. Acknowledges the importance of the Action Plan, but stresses its shortcomings as regards the incorporation of aquatic species; 5. Insists on the full and timely implementation of all elements of the Action Plan reflecting the urgent need to stop illegal and unsustainable practices and prevent further species decline; calls on the Commission to provide Parliament and the Council with yearly written implementation updates and to set up an ongoing detailed monitoring and evaluation mechanism to measure progress, including the actions taken by Member States; 6. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to better increase the protection of the habitats of target species and stresses that increased protection should be ensured for areas designated as Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems, Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas and Natura 2000 network sites; 7. Calls on the Commission to establish a dedicated Wildlife Trafficking Coordinator’s office, mirroring the model used to fight human trafficking, in order to ensure a joined-up effort by different Commission services and the Member States; 8. Reminds the Commission that many aquatic species are also in danger of being extinct, which will affect the sustainability of many ecosystems; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to further develop scientific studies on technological adaptations of fishing gears in order to avoid bycatch, given the fact that a number of species, including turtles, are threatened by both bycatch and wild animal trafficking; C 224/120 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2018 Thursday 24 November 2016 
Preventing wildlife trafficking and addressing its root causes 10. Calls for a targeted and coordinated series of awareness-raising campaigns by the EU, third countries, stakeholders and civil society with the aim of reducing demand related to the illegal trade in wildlife products through real and lasting individual and collective behavioural change; recognises the role civil society organisations can play in supporting the Action Plan; 11. Calls on the EU to support initiatives promoting the development of alternative sustainable livelihoods for rural communities close to wildlife, which increase local benefits from conservation measures, minimise human-wildlife conflicts and promote wildlife as a valuable community income; believes that such initiatives, when taken in consultation with the communities concerned, will increase support for conservation and contribute to the recovery, conservation and sustainable management of wildlife populations and their habitats; 12. Stresses that wildlife protection must be a key element in the EU’s global poverty-reduction strategies and calls for actions that enable local communities to benefit directly from engaging in wildlife protection to be included in the various cooperation agreements negotiated with third countries; 13. Reminds the Commission that illegal trafficking in aquatic species also affects the economic development of coastal communities and the environmental suitability of our waters; 14. Calls for the EU, as a matter of urgency, to address corruption and the shortcomings of international governance measures across the wildlife trafficking chain; calls for the EU and its Member States to engage with partner countries through the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and other fora to tackle the problem in source, transit and destination markets; calls on all Member States to fully comply with and effectively implement the provisions of UNCAC; welcomes the international commitment on counter-corruption under Article 10 of UN General Assembly Resolution 69/314 of July 2015; 15. Recognises the need to provide assistance, guidance and training to authorities in source, transit and destination countries concerning investigation, enforcement and judicial procedures at local, regional and national level; underlines the need to coordinate these efforts in an efficient way among all agencies involved in this work; calls for the EU to support the exchange of best practices and to enable specialised equipment and expertise to be provided where necessary; 16. Takes note of the Council conclusions on the EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking of 20 June 2016, recognising that wildlife crime is a serious and growing threat to biodiversity and the environment but also to global security, the rule of law, human rights and sustainable development; strongly regrets the lack of clear commitments by the Member States; stresses the decisive role of the Member States in the full and coherent implementation of the Action Plan at national level and in delivering the objectives set out therein; 17. Urges governments of the supply countries to: (i) improve the rule of law and create effective deterrents by strengthening criminal investigation, prosecution and sentencing; (ii) enact stronger laws treating illicit wildlife trafficking as a ‘serious crime’ deserving the same level of attention and gravity as other forms of transnational organised crime; (iii) allocate more resources to combating wildlife crime, particularly to strengthen wildlife law enforcement, trade controls, monitoring, and customs detection and seizure; (iv) commit to a zero-tolerance policy on corruption; Making implementation and enforcement more effective 18. Calls on the Member States to put in place wildlife trafficking action plans detailing enforcement policies and penalties, and to publish and exchange the information on seizures and arrests relating to wildlife crimes, in order to ensure consistency and harmonised approaches between Member States; supports the setting up of a mechanism to provide the Commission with regular data and information updates on seizures and arrests in the Member States and promote the sharing of best practice; 27.6.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 224/121 Thursday 24 November 2016 
19. Insists on the importance of the full implementation and enforcement of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations; 20. Proposes that the penalties for wildlife trafficking, especially in areas with vulnerable marine ecosystems or falling within the Natura 2000 network, should be sufficiently severe as to deter potential offenders; 21. Urges the Member States to ensure that enforcement agencies, prosecution services and national judiciaries have the necessary financial and human resources and appropriate expertise to combat wildlife crime; strongly encourages the Commission and the Member States to increase their efforts to train and raise the awareness of all relevant agencies and institutions; 22. Welcomes the efforts of the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL), the European Network of Prosecutors for the Environment (ENPE), the EU Forum of Judges for the Environment (EUFJE) and the network of police officers focusing on tackling environmental crime (EnviCrimeNet); 23. Notes the inclusion of illegal wildlife trade in the EU Agenda for Security 2015-2020, which recognises that the illegal trade in wildlife threatens biodiversity in source regions, sustainable development and regional stability; 24. Suggests that Member States invest the proceeds from fines imposed for trafficking in the protection and conservation of wild flora and fauna; 25. Calls for a step change in intelligence-gathering, law-making and law enforcement, and in the fight against corruption, in relation to wildlife trafficking in the Member States and other destination and transit countries; calls, therefore, on the Commission to pay very close attention to these aspects of administrating and monitoring the enforcement of international standards in relation to wildlife trafficking; 26. Stresses that in order to avoid the ‘migration’ of wildlife criminal networks, the harmonisation of policies and legal frameworks with respect to wildlife crime is particularly important; 27. Underlines the need for improved inter-agency cooperation and for functioning and timely data sharing between national and EU-level implementation and enforcement agencies; calls for the creation of strategic enforcement networks at both EU and Member State level in order to facilitate and improve such cooperation; calls on all the Member States to establish wildlife crime units to facilitate implementation across the various agencies; 28. Calls on the Member States to provide Europol with continuous and relevant intelligence and data; urges Europol to consider wildlife crime in the next EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA); calls for the establishment of a specialised Wildlife Crime Unit within Europol, with transnational powers and responsibilities and sufficient financial and human resources, enabling centralised information and analysis and coordinated enforcement strategies and investigations; 29. Calls on the Commission to promote the EU-TWIX system as a proven and well-functioning tool for Member States to share data and information, and to ensure a long-term financial commitment to it; believes that civil society organisations can play an important role in monitoring enforcement and reporting on wildlife crime; calls for further cooperation from the EU and the Member States to support such efforts by NGOs; 30. Notes the links between wildlife crime and other forms of organised crime, including money laundering and the financing of militias and terrorist groups, and considers international cooperation for the combating of illicit financial flows to be a priority; calls for the EU and the Member States to use all relevant instruments, including cooperation with the financial sector, and to monitor and carry out research on the effects of emerging financial products and practices that are involved in this activity; C 224/122 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2018 Thursday 24 November 2016 
31. Urges the Member States to fully implement the provisions of Directive 2008/99/EC on the protection of the environment through criminal law and to set appropriate levels of sanctions for wildlife crime offences; is concerned that some Member States have not yet fully implemented the directive and calls on the Commission to assess the implementation in each Member State, especially in terms of penalties, and to provide guidance; calls on the Commission to undertake a review of Directive 2008/99/EC, in particular with regard to its effectiveness in combating wildlife crime, within the time frame set out in the EU Agenda for Security, and to make a proposal to revise it as appropriate; calls on the Commission to take steps towards establishing and implementing common minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions relating to wildlife trafficking, pursuant to Article 83(1) TFEU on particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension; 32. Considers that the customs dimension of the Action Plan should be further highlighted, with regard to both cooperation with partner countries and better and more effective implementation within the Union; looks forward, therefore, to the Commission’s 2016 review of the implementation and enforcement of the EU’s current legal framework, and asks for this review to include an assessment of customs procedures; 33. Urges the Member States to effectively implement and comply with the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) as a basis for international action and mutual legal assistance and as a key step towards a common coordinated approach to combating wildlife crime; deeply regrets, in this connection, the fact that eleven Member States have not yet implemented UNTOC; calls on the Member States in question to implement the Convention as soon as possible; 34. Considers that action against wildlife crime requires consistent, effective and dissuasive criminal penalties; urges the Member States to define wildlife trafficking as a serious crime in accordance with Article 2(b) of UNTOC; 35. Recognises the need for guidance on prosecution and sentencing for Member State judiciaries and prosecutors and the need for training for customs and enforcement officers at entry points into the EU; considers UNEP’s ‘Global Judges Programme’ and the ‘Green Customs Initiative’ partnership as models to follow; 36. Calls on the Commission, the relevant EU agencies and the Member States to recognise the scale of online wildlife trafficking and to build capacity within environmental crime and customs units, coordination with cybercrime units, and engagement with civil society organisations, in order to ensure that channels exist to trigger assistance from cross-border units specialised in cybercrime; 37. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to engage with the operators of social media platforms, search engines and e-commerce platforms on the problem of the illegal internet trade in wildlife; calls on the Commission and the Member States to strengthen control measures and to develop policies to address potential illegal activity on the internet; in this regard, calls on the Commission to develop guidelines on how to address the problem of online wildlife crime at EU level; 38. Calls on EU and Member State enforcement agencies to identify and monitor the patterns of other forms of serious and organised crime, such as human trafficking, in order to aid prevention activities and the investigation of irregularities in the supply chain when tackling wildlife trafficking, for example suspicious shipments and financial transactions; 39. Welcomes the fact that the EU participated in COP17 for the first time as a party to CITES and welcomes the fact that the EU and the Member States demonstrate strong dedication and provide substantial financial support for CITES; 40. Welcomes UNEP’s expert review process, which is seeking to create a universally recognised definition of environmental crime; in this regard, notes that the legal boundaries between different types of environmental crimes are sometimes unclear, which can reduce opportunities for effective prosecution and punishment; 27.6.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 224/123 Thursday 24 November 2016 
Strengthening the global partnership 41. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to step up dialogue and cooperation with source, transit and destination countries in the wildlife trafficking supply chain and to provide them with technical and economic assistance and diplomatic support; believes that the EU must act at international level to support third countries in combating wildlife trafficking and contribute to the further development of necessary legal frameworks through bilateral and multilateral agreements; 42. Highlights that widespread corruption, institutional weaknesses, state erosion, mismanagement and weak penalties for wildlife crime are major challenges that need to be addressed if transnational wildlife trafficking is to be combated effectively; urges the EU to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce poaching incentives by improving economic opportunities and promoting good governance and the rule of law; 43. Calls on the EU institutions, the Member States and all states concerned to investigate more systematically the links between wildlife trafficking and regional conflicts and terrorism; 44. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to establish a trust fund or similar facility under Article 187 of the revised Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union, with the objective of safeguarding protected areas and combating wildlife trafficking and poaching, as part of the Action Plan against wildlife trafficking; 45. Calls on the EU to upgrade the financial and technical support, provided through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Development Fund (EDF), aimed at helping developing countries implement national wildlife regulations in line with CITES recommendations, particularly for those with insufficient resources to enforce legislation and prosecute smugglers; 46. Calls on the Commission to consider funding under the Partnership Instrument for initiatives aimed at reducing demand for illicit wildlife products in key markets, in line with Priority 1 of the Action Plan; highlights that the involvement of civil society in the monitoring structures under the trade and sustainable development chapters of EU trade agreements can make significant contributions in this regard; 47. Stresses the importance of addressing, in the context of the EU-China Strategic Partnership, the sensitive issue of the growing demand for wildlife products, such as elephant ivory, rhino horn and tiger bones, which represents a real threat to the conservation of the species concerned and to biodiversity in general; 48. Calls on the Commission to include mandatory and enforceable sustainable development chapters in all EU trade agreements and negotiations, with specific reference to halting illegal trade in wildlife in all economic sectors, and calls on the Commission to include analyses of these provisions in its implementation reports; urges the Commission to emphasise the implementation of CITES and measures against wildlife crime in the GSP+ trade scheme; 49. Notes that corruption is one of the main enablers and contributors to the trade in illegal wildlife and wildlife products; welcomes the commitment made in the Commission strategy entitled ‘Trade for All’ to include ambitious anti- corruption provisions to tackle the direct and indirect impact of both corruption and wildlife trafficking in all future trade agreements; requests, therefore, that the Commission pay the utmost attention to the facets of administration and monitoring of the enforcement of international standards in relation to wildlife trafficking; 50. Calls on the EU to explore, within the scope of the WTO framework, how global trade and environmental regimes can better support each other, especially in the context of ongoing work on strengthening coherence between the WTO and Multilateral Environmental Agreements, as well as in light of the Trade Facilitation Agreement, which opens up new avenues for cooperation between customs and wildlife and trade officials, especially in developing countries; considers that further opportunities for cooperation between the WTO and CITES should be explored, in particular in terms of offering technical assistance and capacity-building on trade and environment matters to officials from developing countries; C 224/124 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2018 Thursday 24 November 2016 
51. Underlines the key role of international cooperation by the organisations in the enforcement chain; calls on the EU and the Member States to continue to support the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC); welcomes any strengthening of this support, including through the provision of financial resources and specialist expertise, in order to facilitate capacity-building, promote the exchange of information and intelligence and support enforcement and compliance; calls on the Commission to use ICCWC indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of EU funding to third countries in support of actions against wildlife trafficking and to facilitate a uniform and credible assessment of development funding; 52. Welcomes international law enforcement operations such as Operation COBRA III, which result in significant seizures of illegal wildlife products and arrests of traffickers and provide increased public visibility of wildlife trafficking as a serious organised crime; 53. Calls on the Member States to reinforce the CITES budget so that the organisation can expand its monitoring activity and species designation; in this regard, regrets that six Member States still have outstanding payments from the years 1992 to 2015 to be made to CITES; 54. Welcomes also the fact that the EU Action Plan makes a major contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, agreed by heads of state at a UN summit in September 2015; EU as a destination market, source and transit point 55. Notes that CITES, the EU Timber Regulation and the EU IUU regulatory framework are important tools for regulating international wildlife trade; is concerned, however, about the lack of proper implementation and enforcement and calls on Member States to step up their joint and coordinated efforts to ensure effective implementation; is concerned, furthermore, about gaps in the current regulatory framework with regard to species and actors; calls, therefore, for the EU to review the existing legislative framework with a view to supplementing it with a prohibition on the making available and placing on the market, transport, acquisition and possession of wildlife that has been illegally harvested or traded in third countries; considers that such legislation could harmonise the existing EU framework and that the transnational impact of such legislation could play a key role in reducing global wildlife trafficking; in this respect, highlights that such legislation must provide full transparency regarding any trade prohibitions of species based on their illegal status in a third country in order to ensure legal certainty for those involved in legal trade; 56. Underlines that trophy hunting has contributed to large-scale declines in endangered species listed in CITES Appendices I and II and urges the Commission and the Member States to establish a precautionary approach for the import of hunting trophies from species protected under the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations, to support the further strengthening of the EU’s legal provisions governing the import of hunting trophies into EU Member States, and to require permits for the import of trophies of all species listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 338/97; 57. Welcomes the 2016 Buckingham Palace Declaration, in which signatories from airlines, shipping firms, port operators, customs agencies, intergovernmental organisations and conservation charities commit to raising standards across the transport sector with a focus on information sharing, staff training, technological improvements, and resource sharing across companies and organisations worldwide; calls on all parties to fully implement the commitments of the Declaration; encourages the Member States to promote voluntary commitments similar to the Buckingham Palace Declaration in other areas, in particular the financial and e-commerce sectors; 58. Calls for the full and immediate ban at European level of trade, export or re-export within the EU and to destinations outside the EU of ivory, including ‘pre-Convention’ ivory, and rhino horns; calls for the establishment of a mechanism to assess the need for similar restrictions for other endangered species; 27.6.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 224/125 Thursday 24 November 2016 
59. Notes that the EU regulation to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing has made an impact, but insists that implementation should be more robust in order to ensure that no illegal fish enter the European market; suggests that the EU Member States should be more consistent and effective in checks of catch documentation (catch certificates) and consignments (in particular from countries judged as high-risk) in order to ensure that fish have been caught legally; 60. Highlights the importance of the private sector’s involvement in the fight against wildlife trafficking by means of self-regulation and through corporate social responsibility; considers traceability in the supply chain essential for legal and sustainable trade, whether commercial or non-commercial; highlights the need for cooperation and coordination at international level as well as between the public and private sectors and calls on the EU to strengthen the existing control instruments, including the use of traceability mechanisms; considers that the transport sector should play a pivotal role, for example by implementing an early warning detection system; notes the important role public-private partnerships can play in this regard; 61. Calls, in addition to border checks required under Regulation (EC) No 338/97, for Member States to introduce in- country compliance monitoring with regular checks on traders and permit holders such as pet shops, breeders, research centres and nurseries, and including monitoring of trades such as fashion, art, medicine and catering, that may use illegal plant and animal parts; 62. Calls on the Member States to ensure the immediate confiscation of any seized specimens and the care and re- homing of seized or confiscated live specimens at animal rescue centres appropriate to the species; calls on the Commission to provide guidance to ensure that all wildlife rescue centres used by the Member States are of adequate standard; calls, furthermore, on the EU and the Member States to ensure adequate financing of animal rescue centres; 63. Calls on the Member States to adopt national plans for the handling of live confiscated specimens in line with Annex 3 to CITES Resolution Conference 10.7 (Rev. CoP15); stresses that Member States should report all seized live specimens to EU-TWIX and that annual summary reports should be published, and that Member States should ensure that the training of enforcement officers includes welfare and safety considerations for the handling of live animals; calls on the EU and the Member States to commit adequate financial support to wildlife rescue centres; 64. Calls on the Member States to consider ‘positive list’ species systems, whereby exotic species are assessed objectively and according to scientific criteria for their safety and suitability for trading and keeping as pets; o o o 65. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission. C 224/126 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2018 Thursday 24 November 2016

Brussels, 26 January 1999 OPINION of the Committee of the Regions of 14 January 1999 on the Communication from the Commission on the Social Action Programme 1998-2000 (COM(1998) 259 final) CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh 

The Committee of the Regions, HAVING REGARD TO the Communication from the Commission on the Social Action Programme 1998-2000 (COM(1998) 259 final); HAVING REGARD TO the decision of the Commission on 5 May 1998 to consult the Committee, under the first paragraph of Article 198c of the Treaty establishing the European Community; HAVING REGARD TO the decision of its Bureau on 13 May 1998 to instruct Commission 5 for Social Policy, Public Health, Consumer Protection, Research and Tourism to draw up the relevant opinion; HAVING REGARD TO the Draft Opinion (CdR 277/98 rev. 1) adopted by Commission 5 on 9 November 1998 (rapporteur: Ms Buron); adopted the following opinion at its 27th plenary session held on 13 and 14 January 1999 (meeting of 14 January). 1. Introduction Justification of the Commission communication 1.1 A new stage in social policy The Committee of the Regions feels that the European Commission's Communication on the Social Action Programme 1998-2000 is an essential tool in the development of the European social model. 1.1.1 The Committee set out its priorities regarding this social model in the following opinions in particular: - 11 June 1997 - Report of the Comité des Sages: for a Europe of civic and social rights - 20 September 1995 - Medium-term Social Action Programme (1995-1997) - 16 November 1994 - European social policy: a way forward for the Union. The Social Action Programme 1998-2002 is particularly important since it marks a new stage in European social policy, of which the key features are: 1.1.2 a broad-based approach which embraces: - employment promotion CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
- 2- - issues of exclusion and equal opportunities and - a commitment, through reform, to the defence of an effective social protection system; 1.1.3 wider, sounder legal bases, as a result not least of the incorporation of the social chapter and an employment title into the Amsterdam Treaty; 1.1.4 greater emphasis on social policy in other Community policies, with an acknowledgement, finally, of the correlation between economic and social policy. In practice, this is reflected in joint ECOFIN/social affairs meetings of the Council of Ministers. The annual adoption of employment guidelines and the scrutiny of national employment plans mark the start of a process that broadly mirrors the multilateral surveillance carried out on the economic front; 1.1.5 a new legislative drive, drawing on agreements between the social partners, and culminating in the adoption of a number of important directives. 1.2 The European social model: challenges and priorities The European social model faces many challenges, making it all the more vital to embark on this new stage. The Commission communication rightly underlines the nature of these challenges: • the persistence of unacceptably low employment levels; • the need to rapidly accommodate new forms of work organization and the advent of the information society; • growing manifestations of exclusion even in a society which is broadly "rich" by world standards; • ageing of the population and • society's desire for a deeper democracy and real "civil dialogue". 1.3 Moreover, tensions between economic competitiveness and the social model are increasingly apparent in today's world: budgetary restraints versus the equalization of resources (pensions, benefits), labour costs versus the minimum wage, flexibility versus security, and so on. Europe must build on its social model to ensure that these tensions do not become deep-seated contradictions. This is imperative as exclusion is an increasingly common phenomenon in cities, often spawning racism and divisions between communities; the number of jobless is rising, and benefits and pensions systems are reaching saturation point. The process will be not be easy, particularly given the budgetary constraints facing all tiers of European government (national, regional and local), but there is no doubt that it is indispensable. 1.4 The COR firmly believes that the European social model should assimilate changes while developing the means to anticipate them. A Europe-wide approach is vital here to guarantee minimum social standards and social cohesion within the Union - a necessary condition for economic growth. CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
3- 1.5 Major changes and the local and regional authorities This state of affairs concerns all tiers of public administration (Union, Member States, regions and local authorities), and the European Commission occupies a pivotal position as coordinator and driving force. While the state is responsible for national social policy, local and regional authorities are in the front line when it comes to dealing with changes to that policy. Changes begin locally and affect geographical areas, and it is local and regional authorities that have had to face up to and deal with the consequences. Despite inadequate funding to meet this increased burden of work, local authorities have demonstrably been able to adapt: they have become facilitators of economic growth to favour employment; they provide for social integration; and they update their services in order to maintain cohesion within their own area. They are the daily manifestation of the subsidiarity principle. It is for the sake of that principle that regional and local government must be drawn into European social policy making and help to devise solutions to their everyday problems. Once again, the local authorities - particularly the smaller ones - have shown that they have a good grasp of the changing needs of their areas, and also of the means and social measures best suited to tackle the problems successfully. In terms of the administrative arrangements across the European Union, this implies a more thorough awareness (drawing on the appropriate statistical tools) of local and regional authorities' remits and activities in the various policy areas outlined in the communication. 1.6 Moreover, the COR would stress that local and regional authority action to promote employment and eradicate exclusion must be given the requisite financial backing at national and European level. The Committee wishes to make the following specific comments on the Commission communication: 2. Bases for renewal The Commission is right to highlight the more solid grounding of EU social policy today and the range of tools which can be deployed for its renewal. These include a wider legal basis in the treaties, the adoption of new legislative proposals, a deepening of social dialogue and a widening of the social policy debate. Social policy renewal must therefore apply both to the foundations of the Union and to specific, carefully coordinated initiatives that form part of a wider strategy. 2.1 Acquis: the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam The primary acquis is the Treaty of Amsterdam. The COR maintains that in some areas, as was the case for employment policy, practical planning should begin immediately, in CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
anticipation of ratification of the Treaty by the Member States. For example, measures should be proposed to improve the situation of the disabled, on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the relevant accompanying declaration, and taking account of the Member States' responsibilities. 2.2 Continuing the legislative process The second acquis is the directives adopted or proposed by the European Commission in the fields of health and safety, working conditions and equal opportunities. As the Commission rightly stresses, the recent directives on works councils, parental leave and atypical work show the need for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament to take legislative action in order to build on the existing platform of minimum social standards. The COR stresses in particular the need for the Commission to implement the measures listed in Annex 2 of the communication. Moreover, this work must go on, drawing primarily on European social dialogue. 2.3 Work programme The COR welcomes the implementation of the Commission work programme. Since strategic initiatives of this kind have an impact on local and regional authorities, the Committee feels that it should be consulted on the programme as a whole. 2.4 Social policy debate The COR is in favour of European social policy taking account of areas such as population trends, social protection and the fight against racism. Social policy must be treated globally and mainstreamed into all other Community policies. This integration process must not be limited to matters such as equal opportunities: all the social aspects of Community policies must be taken into account systematically. 3. Rising to the challenges of a changing world These changes, linked largely to developments in the world of work, often cause major problems for local authorities, which are faced with crisis situations (company closures, labour market shortcomings, exclusion). They are constantly required to experiment with new ways of protecting their communities. Whilst the state is still responsible for many aspects of social policy, the local authorities are playing an ever-increasing role in: - providing employment - managing social exclusion - facilitating local economic activity - providing social services CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
- 5- - taking responsibility for health and safety - organizing public participation in the democratic process - providing local and regional public services. The local and regional authorities are ready to take on these responsibilities, as long as they are provided with adequate funds. 3.1 In the area of social affairs in particular - Specifically local role - providing services Unemployment is the main challenge: the employment rate is still too low. The reasons for this vary widely, with under-qualification a particular source of concern. Furthermore, job loss and an inaccessible labour market lead to exclusion, poverty and the need to retrain. Local and regional authorities may have little room for manoeuvre when it comes to economic policy, but they do support business development and the education and training of men and women, besides providing public services (benefits, housing, health care, social integration and citizenship). To this end they must modernize. 3.2 Forms of work and the organization of work are changing: a response to these changes can be found in adaptability and flexibility, if they are achieved through negotiation and if job security is safeguarded. 3.3 Social exclusion persists despite state aid policies and is jeopardizing the European social model. New ways of fighting exclusion are being tried out at local and regional level: these pilot schemes should fuel national and European debate on renewing social policy. 3.4 The Committee stresses the importance of drawing up an inventory of European local and regional authority powers and the kinds of initiatives they pursue in these fields. The Committee would ask Member States and the Council to ensure that their involvement in these policies is fully brought to bear. This inventory is all the more essential to enable the European Union to take full account of the various schemes organized by regional and local authorities in the social field, particularly in the light of forthcoming Structural Fund reform. 3.5 Meanwhile, the Committee calls on the Commission to ensure that there is no contradiction between competition policy (monitoring the allocation of state and regional aid) and local job creation. 3.6 The need for statistical knowledge and indicators Local authorities are responsible for many aspects of social policy, as a result of their powers and proximity to the public, but they lack the indicators and statistical knowledge to enable CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
them to evaluate social and population trends in their areas, and the impact of their action. Moreover, Community institutions need local indicators to assess cohesion policy, urban policy and the impact of the Structural Funds, and to enhance the debate on the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP). However, to avoid undue financial burden on local and regional authorities, this task should be incorporated into the statistical activities of the EU. The Committee calls for these indicators to be developed on a local or regional basis (NUTS II or III). 3.7 For European integration as a whole - Combining economic and social aspects With monetary union, the EU is set to complete the integration of the single market. There is an overriding economic imperative, but in no instance must the social dimension be dissociated from it; the interaction between economic and social aspects must be given due consideration. The Commission, the Member States and the local authorities must be given pointers to help them appreciate this interdependence and they must step up debate and exchange, in order to ensure coordination of economic and social policies across the board. 3.8 - Demographic data The Commission rightly highlights the importance of this issue. The impact of population trends on employment and social protection systems, not to mention living conditions, healthcare and public services is mounting. All these areas are the responsibility of local authorities: they will call for added investment but could also generate employment. 3.9 - Enlargement The renewed European social model must take EU enlargement into account. An essential precondition for the accession of new Member States is that they adopt the acquis communautaire. The applicant countries' economic, social and demographic structures differ considerably from those of the existing Member States. Preparations must be made for their accession, in order to avert the effects of differences in labour costs, social protection and working conditions. Sudden adjustment is out of the question for these countries; work to help them make the necessary changes must therefore begin now, for the sake of future European cohesion. 3.10 - Involving the future Member States in the COR The COR takes the view that though local and regional government is not highly developed in these countries, it will play a critical part in the process, owing to its proximity to the general public. The Committee calls for the local and regional authorities of the future Member CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
- 7- States to be given observer status in the Committee of the Regions, so as to enable them to take an active part in the enlargement of the Union. 3.11 - Pooling experience The COR also hopes that opportunities will be found to pool experience with the local authorities of the future Member States on specific matters, and asks that, with them in mind, the Phare programme be reviewed to incorporate a social policy section. 4. The next steps: pursuing an agenda for change The COR concurs with the objectives set by the European Commission: social progress must go hand in hand with economic progress. The concept of living standards is central, but it must encompass quality of life, equal opportunities and social cohesion. Furthermore, although employment is crucial, it alone cannot generate an inclusive society. Integration, health and quality of life (living conditions, transport, education) facilitate access to employment. Local and regional authorities have a critical part to play here. 4.1 Tools - Partnership: The local level as the natural habitat for partnership; structuring the partnership: The Commission states that partnership is a prime tool for renewing European social policy, and the COR supports that view. The Commission hopes that partnership will deepen the debate on social policy by means of political, social and civil dialogue. The COR believes that the most appropriate place to build that dialogue is locally and regionally. It is here that the political, economic and social partners can meet to decide on common strategies and reach political consensus. 4.2 A new factor to be taken into consideration is the advent of European citizenship and the desire to find a place for civil dialogue alongside social dialogue in the institutional system. 4.3 "Civil" dialogue with the public is most effective at local level, centring on commonly recognized goals. Local and regional authorities are primary partners for both employment policy and an inclusive society. 4.4 The COR welcomes the European Commission's move to strengthen the partnership principle within the Structural Funds, and calls for the same principle to be followed in the debate on European social policy. Local and regional authorities must be allowed to input their experience in drafting, implementing (where they are in the front line) and assessing the policy, as part of a programme coordinated by the European Commission. CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
4.5 - Setting up forums for exchange The European Commission has set up working groups (e.g. for anticipating industrial change) whose purpose is of direct concern to local and regional authorities. The COR feels that all too often local and regional authorities are absent from this type of initiative and asks that in future it be included in these groups and in the regular discussions mentioned in the Commission communication. As in the past, the COR would particularly like to be involved in the next European Social Fora. The preliminary work for these fora should be carried out in conjunction with the local and regional authorities, who should also be brought into any social policy debate launched by forthcoming Union presidencies. 4.6 - Financial support: easier access for local authorities The Committee of the Regions endorses the Commission's proposals regarding the ESF and Objective 3. It points out, however, that the "human resource" dimension requires planning, execution and follow-up to be connected as closely as possible to local realities. The COR also feels that support should be given to pilot programmes for local authorities, especially in the employment field. Local and regional authorities need clearly identified access to this funding and more straightforward administrative arrangements. 4.7 Measures Employment • Framework: involving local authorities in the NAPs and in NAP assessment The Commission stresses that economic and monetary convergence must be accompanied by employment policy convergence as agreed by the Union. Convergence is to be achieved by means of national employment plans (NAPs), prepared by each Member State. The communication highlights the need to involve regional bodies, and the Committee of the Regions would stress this point. A study of the 1998 NAPs reveals that, despite their key role in employment, local and regional authorities were barely consulted in the preparation of the plans and are all too rarely involved in implementing them. 4.8 The COR calls on the Council to involve it in developing employment guidelines, and would press the Member States to enlist local and regional authority support in implementing the national action plans for employment. Local employment policies must become part and parcel of this mechanism and must no longer be reduced to ad hoc corrective measures: they should be part of a global strategy. CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
• Activities 4.9 From 1998, the Commission hopes to launch a number of debates. They concern local and regional authorities, and the COR would like to be involved in them: 4.9.1 Standard of living and employment rate: living standards must be improved while aiming to reduce regional inequalities and thus further the geographical cohesion of the Union. 4.9.2 Stepping up local information exchange: the COR stresses the need to pool data, best practice and innovation regarding the labour market. More than a nation-wide exercise, this should provide a way of measuring both the impact of local developments and the gaps to be bridged. 4.9.3 Given that innovation often takes place at local level, this programme for pooling experience and data must be carried out locally/regionally. In addition, local and regional authorities must be able to interpret the information in order to assess the situation and trends in their areas. This database must also be consistent with Structural Fund allocation criteria. 4.9.4 The COR would like to be consulted on the setting-up of a database of this kind, to which local and regional authorities must have easy access. 4.9.5 Undeclared work: this type of employment runs contrary to workers' basic rights, but in some countries it accounts for a considerable proportion of local jobs. Thanks to their closeness to the citizen, local and regional authorities can be instrumental in unearthing undeclared work and reintegrating such workers - particularly the most vulnerable groups - into the labour market. Local and regional authorities can undoubtedly play a valuable role in combating child labour. 4.9.6 Backing entrepreneurship: the COR would highlight the support given by local and regional authorities to the creation of SMEs. 4.9.7 Modernizing public employment services: studies of public employment services show that devolved or decentralized services are more effective as they are closer to the needs of job- seekers and companies. Local and regional authorities must be involved in this modernization process. 4.9.8 Local development measures: innovative local job creation measures are the key to employment growth in Europe. Some lean on the social economy, while others take direct action in the market sector. These practices have been analysed by the European Commission's Forward Studies Unit. The COR supports such measures. It asks the Commission to press ahead with this work and to disseminate the results as widely as possible, with optimum access for local and regional authorities, particularly via the Internet. CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
-10- It also hopes that the Commission will continue to support the Territorial Employment Pacts. The Committee once again stresses that local and regional authorities must have the human and financial resources they need to carry through these innovative schemes and that Structural Fund support should be widely available for local development in general. 4.10 Updating education and training programmes: inasmuch as their remit covers these areas, local and regional authorities will be partners in the new Community programmes and must be involved in the preliminary work. 4.10.1 Entrepreneurship, adaptation and training: local and regional authorities stimulate economic development and already help to provide locally-tailored services to encourage start-ups (business parks, joint management services, etc.). They are also able to gauge the training and re-training requirements of the workforce, in collaboration with local companies. The COR hopes that the dialogue between private sector and local authorities on adapting human resources will be taken into account in the new Structural Funds Objective 3. 4.10.2 Equal opportunities: local and regional authorities can assist here by providing the services that make such equality possible: reception centres for children and dependants, mobility for the disabled, and so on. They provide support for the most vulnerable groups within society, such as young people, women and the long-term unemployed. Their experience should be tapped when preparing EU programmes. 4.10.3 Family life: no employment strategy sensitive to family life and to changes in family structures can be framed without closely involving the local authorities, as they are responsible for social services, healthcare facilities, and services for older people. 4.10.4 Free movement: on this issue too, local and regional authorities - particularly those in border areas - should cooperate with the Commission with a view to setting up pilot projects. 4.11 The changing world of work 4.11.1 Developing the social dialogue In future, the Committee of the Regions would like to see local and regional authorities actively involved in the social dialogue, as they are at the very core of the "social contract" and democracy. 4.11.2 Local and regional authorities are major employers, and the COR supports the organizations that take part in and further the social dialogue at sectoral level. The Committee feels that it would be desirable - under terms appropriate to the various national administrative systems - to involve local and regional authority employers in the framing of European work-related legislation.

- 1 1- 4.11.3 Teleworking Teleworking can help to generate work in areas that are a long way from traditional service centres. To optimize the development of teleworking, the COR calls for legislation to protect teleworkers, while taking account of the specifically local nature of this type of work. 4.11.4 Anticipating change Anticipating industrial change is a key issue for local and regional authorities; it is essential if economic crises and social deprivation are to be averted in the areas concerned. The issue of the compatibility of state aid with Structural Fund support must also be addressed from a local/regional standpoint. The COR is disappointed not to have been involved in the follow-up to the work of the high-level group on this issue, and would urge that local and regional perspectives be catered for in future work. 4.11.5 Information society and new services The information society concerns local and regional authorities in two respects: firstly in terms of their own organization, and secondly in relation to the public services which they provide. Local authorities manage sectors in which the information society has a major impact (health, safety, transport, etc.). A major effort is required to retrain the workforce and adjust structures in order to make optimum use of the new technologies. Local authorities are also instrumental in ensuring that everyone shares access to the information society. They must bridge the gap between industrial development and public needs, preventing a gulf from forming between the people "in the know" and those with no access to the new technologies. 4.11.6 The COR takes the view that the new technologies are set to change the democratic relationship between the public and local and regional government, generating new forms of democratic participation. The Committee hopes that the necessary resources and expertise will be made available to local and regional authorities under specific programmes and the Structural Funds. 4.11.7 Health and safety This issue affects local and regional authorities on two counts: - as employers, and - as environmental managers: directives on the environment must be coordinated with those on health and safety. CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
-12- 4.12 An inclusive society Integration requires grassroots action tailored to the needs of the public, and this is where local authority involvement is most essential. "Public" policies, rightly described by the Commission as irreplaceable, are largely local, regional and urban policies, although they are part of national social protection schemes. Social protection 4.13 Exchanging best practice It would be useful to be able to compare local government input (funding, implementation) when assessing progress on convergence between social protection systems. 4.14 Encouraging self-employment Self-employment is an under-exploited source of new jobs in Europe, compared for instance with the United States. One major obstacle is the fact that social protection leans in favour of salaried work. Local and regional authorities give grants to entrepreneurs, and the COR would like to see this backed up by a national and Commission-level debate on encouraging self-employment. The Committee would highlight the importance of creating micro-enterprises in disadvantaged rural and problem urban areas, and for vulnerable groups such as women and young people. In this context also, the COR proposes that consideration be given to ways of supporting 'social economy' undertakings and that partners in these undertakings should be treated on the same basis as persons in paid employment. 4.15 Population trends In view of the implications of population trends and movements for local authorities (e.g. the attraction of certain areas for senior citizens), the COR would like to be involved in the consultations on this issue launched by the Commission, which must take due account of the area- specific factors involved here. 4.16 Mobility and pensions A mobile workforce could help to make up the shortfall in skilled labour in certain employment areas. Mobility must be made easier, for instance by making pensions transferable within the Union. In the long term, worker mobility will benefit from the convergence of social security and tax systems. CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh 
-13- 4.17 Local integration measures The COR shares the Commission's view that there is a need to move on from passive integration measures (benefits) to active measures (reintegration into the labour market, social economy, etc.). Many local and regional authorities are already testing measures of this kind. 4.18 The COR calls on the Commission to take practical steps to include local operators in a debate on anti-exclusion policies, as outlined in the communication. Cities are the worst affected by exclusion phenomena, which jeopardize urban safety, cohesion and the sense of citizenship. The Committee would stress the role of local and regional authorities in the drive to eradicate illiteracy and integrate migrants. 4.19 The Committee supports the Commission's initiative to develop a programme to address the refugee problem, which is particularly acute in certain European countries. 4.20 Equal opportunities The COR is committed to equality and the fight against discrimination. Local initiatives are vital here, in order to guarantee social cohesion and integration within communities. 4.21 Public health Local and regional authorities are in the front line when it comes to facing and dealing with the consequences of certain changes (e.g. the ageing population). Here too, local and regional statistics are needed. Moreover, the Europe-wide exchange of best practice is one way of pinpointing innovative and transferable methods. 5. The external dimension 5.1 The exchange of experience between local authorities provides a springboard for promoting the European social model. The addition of a social clause to the World Trade Organization agreements would also be a powerful means of gaining international recognition for the social dimension. 5.2 Although the European social model cannot be exported as it stands, the Commission rightly notes that Europe can promote social progress on the world stage. The Commission's interregional cooperation programmes could play a key role here. The COR calls for a social strand to be included in the future Community initiative that will form the framework for external interregional cooperation. CdR 277/98 fin F/SG/CAT/vh .../... 
-14- 6. Conclusions The COR endorses the objectives defined by the Commission in its communication and the measures planned for improving the European social model in response to economic and social change. The Committee reiterates the fact that local and regional authorities are central to this process, given their proximity to the public and their capacity for innovation. They must be given an opportunity to participate fully and effectively in the debate on the future of the European social model. To this end, the Committee of the Regions hopes: 6.1 to be involved in Community employment policy, particularly in the preparation of the European Employment Guidelines in the year 2000; it urges Member States to draw up their national action plans in partnership with local and regional authorities; 6.2 to be consulted on the setting-up of a local and regional social policy database, which should provide statistics for comparing and assessing social cohesion in Europe; 6.3 that local and regional authorities, as employers, will be given a place in European social dialogue; 6.4 to take part in the European consultation processes on social policy, and in particular, to help prepare any future European Social Forum, where greater consideration should be given to the role of local authorities; 6.5 that the Commission will develop support programmes for the innovative pilot projects set up by local and regional authorities in the fields of employment and social policy; 6.6 that the local and regional authorities of the Union's future Member States will be involved in Community social policy, with regard to employment in particular, and will be able to take part in the work of the Committee of the Regions.
